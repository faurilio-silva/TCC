INTRODUCTION: Super-selective clamping of tumor-specific segmental arteries was
developed to eliminate ischemia of the remnant kidney while limiting hemorrhage
during partial nephrectomy. The objective is to evaluate the benefice of
super-selective clamping on renal functional outcome, compared to
early-unclamping of the renal artery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 2015 to July 2016, data from 30 patients
undergoing super-selective robot-assisted PN (RAPN) for a solitary tumor by a
single surgeon were prospectively collected. Tumor devascularization was assessed
using indocyanine green near-infrared fluorescence. A matched-pair analysis with 
a retrospective cohort undergoing early-unclamping was conducted, adjusting on
tumor complexity and preoperative eGFR. Perioperative, oncologic and functional
outcomes using DMSA-renal scintigraphy were assessed. Multivariate analysis was
performed to identify predictors of postoperative renal function and de novo
chronic kidney disease (CKD).
RESULTS: Super-selective RAPN was successful in 23/30 patients (76.7%), 5
requiring secondary main artery clamping due to persistent tumor fluorescence.
Matched-pair analysis showed similar operating time, blood loss, positives
margins and complication rates. Super-selective clamping was associated with an
improved eGFR variation at discharge (p=0.002), 1-month (p=0.01) and 6-month
post-op (-2%vs-16% p=0.001). It also led to a better relative function on
scintigraphy (46%vs40% p=0.04) and homolateral eGFR (p=0.04), and fewer upstaging
to CKD stage ≥3 (p=0.03). On multivariate analysis, super-selective clamping was 
a predictor of postoperative renal function.
CONCLUSION: Super-selective RAPN leads to an improved preservation of renal
function and a reduced risk of de novo CKD stage≥3, while keeping the benefit of 
main artery clamping on perioperative outcomes.

Introduction: Vesicoureteral reflux is a common disorder in children but can
result in kidney scarring following acute pyelonephritis. The gold standard
diagnostic to detect renal scars in children is (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scintigraphy. DMSA has a number of limitations including radiation
exposure, need for sedation, and radiotracer supply shortages. Contrast-enhanced 
ultrasound (CEUS) is a technique whereby biocompatible microspheres of inert gas 
are administered i.v. that reflect ultrasonography sound waves and do not involve
radiation. Because the contrast agent is rapidly cleared, contrast images must be
obtained within minutes of administration. CEUS has been used in a variety of
organ systems, but its use in pediatric kidney diseases is limited.
Methods: In this study, we performed CEUS in 7 children with documented renal
scars by radiographic imaging consistent with reflux nephropathy.
Results: In all subjects, CEUS detected all previously known radiologic
abnormalities as well as detecting new areas of hypoenhancing renal parenchyma.
None of the patients experienced any serious adverse events.
Discussion: This study represents the first report of using CEUS to characterize 
renal scars in children with reflux nephropathy. We conclude that CEUS is a
highly sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic imaging modality for
detecting and monitoring renal scars in children with vesicoureteral reflux.

Expectant use of CIC in newborns with spinal dysraphism: Report of clinical
outcomes.

Hospital for Children, Dallas, TX, USA.

PURPOSE: Report urologic outcomes among newborns with spinal dysraphism managed
within an expectant clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) program.
METHODS: Newborns were followed clinically and with serial ultrasound (US).
Urodynamics (UD) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan were obtained at
3-6 months, 1 year, 3 years, then as needed. Patients with initial evaluation
after 6 months were excluded.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 3.2 years. 11/102 began catheterization for
continence (median 4.0 years) and 47/102 did not start CIC. Of these, 2/58
developed a DMSA abnormality. 44/102 began CIC early, often for elevated storage 
pressures and febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). Of these, 20/44 developed a 
DMSA abnormality including 9 who had abnormality detected prior to starting CIC. 
Being on CIC or starting immediately upon recognition of new hydronephrosis,
reflux, elevated filling pressures, or febrile UTI was associated with lower
chance of DMSA abnormalities (4/17, 24%) compared to delaying CIC (16/27, 60%)
(p= 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: CIC can be deferred until continence in select infants with a low
risk of significant DMSA abnormality. However, immediate initiation of CIC upon
recognition of risk factors is recommended as this was associated with fewer DMSA
abnormalities than delaying CIC. Recommendations for expectantly-managed patients
include close follow-up, serial US and UD, and prompt initiation of CIC upon
recognition of new hydronephrosis, reflux, elevated storage pressures, or febrile
UTIs.

Discrimination of culture negative pyelonephritis in children with suspected
febrile urinary tract infection and negative urine culture results.

Seongnam, South Korea. Electronic address: naesusana@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: We investigated whether the C-reactive protein (CRP) level, urine
electrolytes, and urine sodium-potassium ratio (uNa/K) could be useful markers
for discriminating children with culture negative pyelonephritis (CNP) from
children with suspected febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI) and negative urine
culture results.
METHODS: We examined 264 children experiencing their first fUTI consecutively
admitted to our hospital between January 2011 and October 2014. Blood tests (CRP,
white blood cell count [WBC], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], electrolytes)
and urine tests (urine protein to creatinine ratio [uProt/Cr], electrolytes,
uNa/K) were performed upon admission. All children with fUTI underwent
99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning at admission. Data were compared
between children with acute pyelonephritis (APN), CNP, lower UTI and controls.
Using multiple logistic regression analysis (MLRA), the ability of these
parameters to predict a cortical defect on DMSA scan (APN and CNP) was analyzed.
RESULTS: The laboratory findings of CNP children were similar with those of APN
children except uProt/cr. The CRP level, WBC count, and ESR were higher in
children with CNP, while uNa and uNa/K were lower than in children with lower UTI
and control. By MLRA, CRP levels and uNa/K were the most relevant factors for
predicting a cortical defect on DMSA scan (P = 0.002, <0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: We conclude that the combination of CRP or WBC and uNa/K are useful
for discriminating children with CNP from children with suspected fUTI and
negative urine culture results.

Hospital , New Delhi , India.

Tuberculous pyelonephritis is rare in children; three case reports are presented.
Case 1 was an 11-year-old girl with a previous history of pulmonary tuberculosis 
who presented with flank pain and fever for 10 days. An ultrasound suggested
focal pyelonephritis, and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan
demonstrated acute focal pyelonephritis and a perinephric collection.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured in the urine. She responded well to
anti-tuberculous treatment (ATT). Case 2 was a 13-year-old boy who presented with
fever, haematuria, burning micturition, proteinuria (3+) and cervical
lymphadenopathy. The Mantoux test was strongly positive. Chest radiograph
demonstrated right hilar lymphadenopathy and ultrasonography showed evidence of
acute pyelonephritis. Tuberculous lymphadenitis was diagnosed by fine-needle
aspiration cytology (FNAC) from cervical lymph nodes and he responded to ATT.
Follow-up urinalysis and ultrasound were normal. Case 3 was a 6-year-old boy, a
known case of pulmonary tuberculosis (from 2 years of age) and a previous
defaulter from ATT. He presented with symptoms of lumbar pain and dysuria. Chest 
radiograph demonstrated mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a CECT of the head showed
a tuberculous granuloma. CECT of the abdomen showed an enlarged left kidney with 
focal pyelonephritis, an abscess in the upper pole and parenchymal calcification.
FNAC of the cervical lymph nodes supported a diagnosis of disseminated
tuberculosis with tuberculous pyelonephritis. He was given 8 months of ATT.
Fifteen months later he presented again with clinical and urinary findings of
urinary tract infection. CECT now demonstrated gross hydronephrosis of the left
kidney, and it was confirmed to be non-functioning by a DMSA scan and magnetic
resonance urogram. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid showed a GFR of
44.3 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Nephrectomy was undertaken and the histology confirmed
tuberculous pyelonephritis. Six months later he was well with an eGFR of
87.2 ml/min/m(2). In patients with symptoms of urinary tract infection but
sterile urine who do not respond to antibiotics or have evidence of tuberculous
elsewhere in the body, careful consideration should be given to the possibility
of tuberculous pyelonephritis.

This article reviews the clinical use of the metal chelators sodium
2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate (DMPS), meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA), and calcium disodium edetate (CaEDTA, calcium EDTA) in overexposure and
poisonings with salts of lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As). DMSA has
considerably lower toxicity than the classic heavy metal antagonist BAL
(2,3-dimercaptopropanol) and is also less toxic than DMPS. Because of its adverse
effects, CaEDTA should be replaced by DMSA as the antidote of choice in treating 
moderate Pb poisoning. Combination therapy with BAL and CaEDTA was previously
recommended in cases of severe acute Pb poisoning with encephalopathy. We suggest
that BAL in such cases acted as a shuttling Pb transporter from the intra- to the
extracellular space. The present paper discusses if a combination of the
extracellularly distributed DMSA with the ionophore, Monensin may provide a less 
toxic combination for Pb mobilization by increasing both the efflux of
intracellularly deposited Pb and the urinary Pb excretion. Anyhow, oral therapy
with DMSA should be continued with several intermittent courses. DMPS and DMSA
are also promising antidotes in Hg poisoning, whereas DMPS seems to be a more
efficient agent against As poisoning. However, new insight indicates that a
combination of low-dosed BAL plus DMPS could be a preferred antidotal therapy to 
obtain mobilization of the intracerebral deposits into the circulation for
subsequent rapid urinary excretion.

Pertechnetate-Induced Addition of Sulfide in Small Olefinic Acids: Formation of
[TcO(dimercaptosuccinate)2](5-) and [TcO(mercaptosuccinate)2](3-) Analogues.

Technetium-99 ((99)Tc) is important to the nuclear fuel cycle as a long-lived
radionuclide produced in ∼6% fission yield from (235)U or (239)Pu. In its most
common chemical form, namely, pertechnetate ((99)TcO4(-)), it is environmentally 
mobile. In situ hydrogen sulfide reduction of pertechnetate has been proposed as 
a potential method to immobilize environmental (99)TcO4(-) that has entered the
environment. Reactions of (99)TcO4(-) with sulfide in solution result in the
precipitation of Tc2S7 except when olefinic acids, specifically fumaric or maleic
acid, are present; a water-soluble (99)Tc species forms. NMR ((1)H, (13)C, and 2D
methods) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy [XAS; near-edge (XANES) and extended
fine structure (EXAFS)] studies indicate that sulfide adds across the olefinic
bond to generate mercaptosuccinic acid (H3MSA) and/or dimercaptosuccinic acid
(H4DMSA), which then chelate(s) the (99)Tc to form [(99)TcO(MSA)2](3-),
[(99)TcO(DMSA)2](5-), or potentially [(99)TcO(MSA)(DMSA)](4-). 2D NMR methods
allowed identification of the products by comparison to (99)Tc and nonradioactive
rhenium standards. The rhenium standards allowed further identification by
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. (99)TcO4(-) is essential to the
reaction because no sulfide addition occurs in its absence, as determined by NMR.
Computational studies were performed to investigate the structures and
stabilities of the potential products. Because olefinic acid is a component of
the naturally occurring humic and fulvic acids found in soils and groundwater,
the viability of in situ hydrogen sulfide reduction of environmental (99)TcO4(-) 
as an immobilization method is evaluated.

OBJECTIVE: To assess yield of imaging performed as per Indian Society of
Pediatric Nephrology (ISPN) urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline.
METHODS: Ultrasonography (USG), voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and
dimercaptosuccinic-acid (DMSA) scintigraphy were performed in 183 children (age
0-5y) with first episode (age 0-1y) of UTI or recurrent (age <5y) UTI, as per
ISPN recommendations.
RESULTS: Significant abnormalities were detected in 110 (63%), with
vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) grades 3-5 in 31% and renal scars in 43%. Combined
USG and DMSA had a negative predictive value of 94% for significant VUR.
Conclusion: ISPN guideline resulted in a high yield of detection of significant
abnormalities.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the imaging results of childhood urinary tract infection
(UTI) in our setting, and examine if it would be appropriate to apply the recent 
guideline changes regarding imaging studies as routine practice in Thailand.
METHODS: Medical records of children with UTI aged 0-15 years were reviewed, with
focus on renal ultrasound (RUS), cystogram, and (99m)Tc dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) renal scan results to determine congenital anomalies of the kidney and
urinary tract (CAKUT) and renal damage. Mild CAKUT was defined as primary
vesicoureteral reflux grades I-III or isolated hydronephrosis, and all other
abnormalities were defined as severe CAKUT.
RESULTS: A total of 142 boys and 129 girls had at least 1 imaging study after
UTI. Their median (interquartile range) age was 1.0 (0.5-2.7) year: 0.7 and 1.4
years for boys and girls, respectively (P = .006). A total of 262 children had an
RUS performed, of which 99 (37.8%) were abnormal. Cystograms were performed in
221 children, from which 83 (37.6%) CAKUTs were detected, and 108 children had a 
DMSA performed, of which 53 (49.1%) were abnormal. Overall, CAKUTs were detected 
in 148 (54.6%) children, of which 43 were severe. RUS together with cystogram
provided higher sensitivity (100% vs 88.9%) and specificity (53.8% vs 42.4%) to
detect severe CAKUT than RUS together with DMSA.
CONCLUSION: A CAKUT was detected in more than half of the children with first
UTI, with one-third having severe CAKUT. In our setting, RUS combined with
cystogram is still the most reliable way to detect potentially harmful post-UTI
problems, and the new western guidelines are not appropriate.

In this study, radiation absorbed dose of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in
critical organs was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation. Ten child patients
with genitourinary abnormalities were imaged using a series of planar, SPECT and 
MRI, after injection with 99mTc-DMSA. Patient-specific organ segmentation was
performed on MRI and used as input in GATE. Organs with substantial uptake
included kidneys, bladder and liver. The mean organ absorbed dose coefficients
(mGy/MBq) were 0.063, 0.058, 0.018, 0.016, 0.013 and 0.010 for the right kidney, 
left kidney, bones, urinary bladder wall, liver and gonads, respectively. The
absorbed dose coefficients in the remainder of the body was 0.012 mGy/MBq. The
authors implemented an image-based Monte Carlo method for patient-specific 3D
absorbed dose calculation. This study also demonstrates the possibility to obtain
patient-specific attenuation map from MRI to be used for the simulations of
radiation transport and energy deposition in phantom using Monte Carlo methods.

BACKGROUND: Symptoms and signs of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) are
nonspecific; therefore, renal biopsy is often necessary to clarify the diagnosis.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA) scintigraphy in the diagnosis and follow-up of ATIN.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of five patients (nine renal
units) with a median age of 14 years who underwent DMSA scan after a clinical
and/or biopsy-proven diagnosis of ATIN. The exam was performed within 1 month
after disease onset and repeated at a median time of 12 months after the acute
phase.
RESULTS: DMSA renal scans performed during the acute phase allowed the discovery 
of suggestive findings, including diffuse reduction of the renal uptake of
radionuclide and presence of multiple 'cold' focal lesions in a corticomedullary 
distribution. The follow-up scintigraphy resulted normal in two patients who were
treated with steroids and in one patient who presented a mild renal dysfunction
in the acute phase. By contrast, the control scan showed persistent renal damage 
in one patient who was further readmitted because of hypertension and in one
renal transplanted patient who presented a Stage 3 acute kidney injury in the
acute phase.
CONCLUSIONS: DMSA renal scan might be a reliable tool for an early non-invasive
diagnosis of ATIN in children and might be particularly useful in those patients 
who are not candidates for a kidney biopsy. Moreover, DMSA scan gives accurate
follow-up evaluation, as it allows monitoring of the evolution of acute renal
parenchymal inflammation with potential risk of renal scar formation. Due to the 
small sample size, our findings warrant further validation in a larger study.

A number of new mono- and dihydroxypyridinethione ligands have been synthesized
via reaction of dimethylamine and amino acid esters with the active amide
obtained from the reaction of 1-hydroxy-2-pyridinethione-4-carboxylic acid (1)
and 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole in DMF. Moreover, the lead complexes of these new
ligands were also prepared. Structures of the newly synthesized compounds have
been confirmed by different spectroscopic methods such as IR, (1)H NMR, and (13)C
NMR, and by elemental analysis. The effect of these synthesized ligands on the
excretion of lead, iron, and zinc, and their distribution in kidneys, liver, and 
bones in acutely intoxicated rats was investigated and results, for lead, were
compared with those of the known drug meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).
Results obtained revealed that compound 5 exhibits remarkable ability in total
fecal and urinary excretion of lead and was superior to DMSA. In addition,
results show that the concentration of lead in soft tissues and bones was lower
in rats treated with HTPL than those treated with DMSA. Furthermore, the
concentration of lead in liver tissues obtained from sub-chronic lead-intoxicated
rats treated with HTPL was lower than those treated with DMSA and calcium
disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CaNa2EDTA).

BACKGROUND: The complexity of the pathogenic mechanism underlying the host immune
response to Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia (App) makes the use of preventive
measures difficult, and a more global view of the host-pathogen interactions and 
new insights into this process are urgently needed to reveal the pathogenic and
immune mechanisms underlying App infection. Here, we infected specific
pathogen-free Mus musculus with App serotype 7 by intranasal inoculation to
construct an acute hemorrhagic pneumonia infection model and isolated the
infected lungs for analysis of the interactions by dual RNA-seq.
RESULTS: Four cDNA libraries were constructed, and 2428 differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) of the host and 333 DEGs of App were detected. The host DEGs were
mainly enriched in inflammatory signaling pathways, such as the TLR, NLR, RLR,
BCR and TCR signaling pathways, resulting in large-scale cytokine up-regulation
and thereby yielding a cytokine cascade for anti-infection and lung damage. The
majority of the up-regulated cytokines are involved in the IL-23/IL-17
cytokine-regulated network, which is crucial for host defense against bacterial
infection. The DEGs of App were mainly related to the transport and metabolism of
energy and materials. Most of these genes are metabolic genes involved in
anaerobic metabolism and important for challenging the host and adapting to the
anaerobic stress conditions observed in acute hemorrhagic pneumonia. Some of
these genes, such as adhE, dmsA, and aspA, might be potential virulence genes. In
addition, the up-regulation of genes associated with peptidoglycan and urease
synthesis and the restriction of major virulence genes might be immune evasion
strategies of App. The regulation of metabolic genes and major virulence genes
indicate that the dominant antigens might differ during the infection process and
that vaccines based on these antigens might allow establishment of a precise and 
targeted immune response during the early phase of infection.
CONCLUSION: Through an analysis of transcriptional data by dual RNA-seq, our
study presents a novel global view of the interactions of App with its host and
provides a basis for further study.

BACKGROUND: Acute biliary pancreatitis is a significant cause of pancreatitis.
The role and timing of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the
setting of acute biliary pancreatitis is still controversial. Persistent
choledocholithiasis in acute biliary pancreatitis occurs and establishing which
patients require an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography based on liver
function tests only can be challenging.
METHOD: Retrospective analysis of the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital's 
ERCP database was performed. All ERCPs performed in patients with acute biliary
pancreatitis were identified and analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 2830 ERCPs were performed during the study period. In total
99 (3%) were performed for suspected choledocholithiasis in acute biliary
pancreatitis with abnormal liver function tests. Thirty (30%) of the ERCPs
confirmed choledocholithiasis while the remaining 69 (70%) yielded no
choledocholithiasis. A significantly higher proportion of patients with
choledocholithiasis required a needle knife sphincterotomy for deep biliary
cannulation. The incidence of immediate complications, such as bleeding, false
tract formation and perforation were comparable between the two groups. Two
models were developed to determine specific cut-off values for conjugated
bilirubin, ALP, GGT, AST and ALT. The calculated cut-off values yielded poor
correlation between sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSION: Determining persistent choledocholithiasis in acute biliary
pancreatitis based on liver function test alone is not ideal. Using conjugated
bilirubin, ALP, GGT, AST and ALT to guide one to perform an ERCP in acute biliary
pancreatitis can be misleading.

INTRODUCTION: Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy is the gold standard in
the evaluation of renal parenchymal defects and is widely used in the pediatric
population. As more recent ultrasound equipment was purchased at our tertiary
pediatric centre, our objective was to evaluate if renal ultrasound (US) results 
are equivalent or sufficient when compared to DMSA scintigraphy in the assessment
of renal anomalies.
METHODS: The charts of all 463 patients who underwent DMSA scintigraphy between
January 2009 and May 2014 at our pediatric tertiary centre were reviewed. The
objective was to look for correlation between US and DMSA scan results for renal 
scars/dysplasia. A hundred and sixty pediatric patients followed with US and DMSA
scan for a total of 285 renal units remained for evaluation after exclusions.
Timing of the exams, urinary tract infection (UTI), and indication for imaging
were reviewed. Results with older (105 patients) and newer (55 patients) US
equipment were compared.
RESULTS: Among the 285 renal units evaluated, 39 (14%) had renal parenchymal
defects shown by US and 87 (31%) by DMSA scintigraphy (sensitivity 36%,
specificity 96%). The DMSA scan was normal for eight abnormal kidneys (3%) on US.
The results were not statistically significant when compared to exams performed
with newer or older US machines.
CONCLUSIONS: At our institution, US data are not sensitive enough to give
reliable information about renal parenchymal defects, even with newer equipment. 
DMSA scintigraphy still remains mandatory for the evaluation of renal anomalies, 
but could be optional if the US exam indicates parenchymal defects.

BACKGROUND: A key characteristic of eutrophication in coastal seas is the
expansion of hypoxic bottom waters, often referred to as 'dead zones'. One
proposed remediation strategy for coastal dead zones in the Baltic Sea is to mix 
the water column using pump stations, circulating oxygenated water to the sea
bottom. Although microbial metabolism in the sediment surface is recognized as
key in regulating bulk chemical fluxes, it remains unknown how the microbial
community and its metabolic processes are influenced by shifts in oxygen
availability. Here, coastal Baltic Sea sediments sampled from oxic and anoxic
sites, plus an intermediate area subjected to episodic oxygenation, were
experimentally exposed to oxygen shifts. Chemical, 16S rRNA gene, metagenomic,
and metatranscriptomic analyses were conducted to investigate changes in
chemistry fluxes, microbial community structure, and metabolic functions in the
sediment surface.
RESULTS: Compared to anoxic controls, oxygenation of anoxic sediment resulted in 
a proliferation of bacterial populations in the facultative anaerobic genus
Sulfurovum that are capable of oxidizing toxic sulfide. Furthermore, the
oxygenated sediment had higher amounts of RNA transcripts annotated as sqr, fccB,
and dsrA involved in sulfide oxidation. In addition, the importance of cryptic
sulfur cycling was highlighted by the oxidative genes listed above as well as
dsvA, ttrB, dmsA, and ddhAB that encode reductive processes being identified in
anoxic and intermediate sediments turned oxic. In particular, the intermediate
site sediments responded differently upon oxygenation compared to the anoxic and 
oxic site sediments. This included a microbial community composition with more
habitat generalists, lower amounts of RNA transcripts attributed to methane
oxidation, and a reduced rate of organic matter degradation.
CONCLUSIONS: These novel data emphasize that genetic expression analyses has the 
power to identify key molecular mechanisms that regulate microbial community
responses upon oxygenation of dead zones. Moreover, these results highlight that 
microbial responses, and therefore ultimately remediation efforts, depend largely
on the oxygenation history of sites. Furthermore, it was shown that
re-oxygenation efforts to remediate dead zones could ultimately be facilitated by
in situ microbial molecular mechanisms involved in removal of toxic H2S and the
potent greenhouse gas methane.

The dose to kidneys of newborns and 1-year old children was calculated using the 
MIRD methodology. In order to perform renal studies radiopharmaceutical like
(99m)Tc-DTPA, (99m) Tc-MAG3 and (99m)Tc-DMSA are used. Here, besides the anatomic
and structure information of kidneys another data are provided in benefit of
patient, however during the radioisotope decay emitted radiations delivers,
totally or partially, their energy. Therefore is important to estimate the
internal radiation dose of the organs. The largest dose to kidneys comes from the
self-dose and it is due to the charged particles emitted during (99m)Tc decay.
From the three radiopharmaceutical here used the largest dose to kidneys is due
to (99m)Tc-DMSA, and the smaller dose is due to (99m)Tc-MAG3.

As the world burden of environmental contamination increases, it is of the utmost
importance to develop streamlined approaches to environmental risk assessment in 
order to prioritize mitigation measures. Whole-cell biosensors or bioreporters
and speciation modeling have both become of increasing interest to determine the 
bioavailability of pollutants, as bioavailability is increasingly in use as an
indicator of risk. Herein, we examine whether bioreporter results are able to
reflect expectations based on chemical reactivity and speciation modeling, with
the hope to extend the research into a wider framework of risk assessment. We
study a specific test case concerning the bioavailability of lead (Pb) in aqueous
environments containing Pb-complexing ligands. Ligands studied include ethylene
diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), meso-2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),
leucine, methionine, cysteine, glutathione, and humic acid (HA), and we also
performed experiments using natural water samples from Lake Tai (Taihu), the
third largest lake in China. We find that EDTA, DMSA, cysteine, glutathione, and 
HA amendment significantly reduced Pb bioavailability with increasing ligand
concentration according to a log-sigmoid trend. Increasing dissolved organic
carbon in Taihu water also had the same effect, whereas leucine and methionine
had no notable effect on bioavailability at the concentrations tested. We find
that bioreporter results are in accord with the reduction of aqueous Pb(2+) that 
we expect from the relative complexation affinities of the different ligands
tested. For EDTA and HA, for which reasonably accurate ionization and
complexation constants are known, speciation modeling is in agreement with
bioreporter response to within the level of uncertainty recognised as reasonable 
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for speciation-based risk
assessment applications. These findings represent a first step toward using
bioreporter technology to streamline the biological confirmation or validation of
speciation modeling for use in environmental risk assessment.

BACKGROUND: Acute pyelonephritis is associated with renal scarring in up to 30%
of patients. Renal scarring may cause significant long-term morbidity. The
pathogenesis of acute pyelonephritis remains unclear, although it involves
interaction among uroepithelium, the immune system cells, and the locally
produced cytokines. That some UTI-prone children develop acute pyelonephritis,
and eventually renal parenchymal scarring, suggests a genetic role.
Interleukin-6, interleukin-8, chemokine receptor-1 (CXCR1), and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNFα), the key regulators of the host immune responses, are
proteins whose secretion is controlled by genes. We postulated that functional
polymorphic variants of their genes might have a role in APN susceptibility.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate a possible association of the common
functional polymorphisms in genes encoding IL-6, IL-8, CXCR1, and TNFα with the
risk of APN in children.
METHODS: Urine culture was used to diagnose 300 children with UTI, of mean age of
51.31 ± 37.4 months (2-180 months). 99Tc-DMSA scans diagnosed 86 children with
APN. Follow-up scans identified new renal scars in 18 children. Six functional
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding IL-6, IL-8, CXCR1, and
TNFα were genotyped in all subjects (IL-6 rs1800795 (-174G/C), IL-6 rs1800796
(-572G/C), IL-8 rs2227306 (781C/T), IL8 rs4073 (-251A/T), CXCR1 rs2234671
(2607G/C), and TNFα rs1800629 (-308G/A)).
RESULTS: TT genotype of IL-8 -251A/T polymorphism was significantly higher in APN
patients (26.7%) than those with lower UTI (11.7%, p = 0.01) and control
individuals (12.2%, p = 0.002). T allele was significantly more common in APN
than in lower UTI (p = 0.025) and was significantly more common in APN (46%) than
in the controls (p = 0.001). Similarly, TT genotype of IL-8 781C/T polymorphism
was significantly more common in APN patients (31.4%) than those with lower UTI
(17.3%, p = 0.003) and the controls (14.3%, p = 0.001). T allele was
significantly more common in APN (55%) than lower UTI (40%, p = 0.005) and
controls (37%, p = 0.001). However, IL-8 -251A/T and +781C/T SNPs did not qualify
as an independent risk for parenchymal infection (OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.68-2.6,
p = 0.13 and OR 2.3, 95% CI 0.89-3.7, p = 0.091, respectively). Lower UTI did not
differ from the controls. The frequency of the genotypes and alleles of IL-6,
CXCR1, and TNFα SNPs did not differ significantly among the different groups of
the study.
CONCLUSION: IL-8 -251A/T and +781C/T SNPs are associated with susceptibility to
renal parenchymal infection in children and could be implicated in APN risk.
However, none of these variants could clearly and independently predict this
risk.

INTRODUCTION: Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans are used 
in the diagnosis of renal scarring. In the Randomized Intervention for Children
with Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) trial that randomized 607 children, DMSA renal
scans were used for evaluating the presence and the severity of renal scarring.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine interobserver variability in reporting of
DMSA renal scans in the RIVUR trial.
STUDY DESIGN: We compared DMSA renal scan reports for renal scarring and acute
pyelonephritis from all non-reference local radiologists (ALRs) at study sites
with adjudicated as well as non-adjudicated reports from two reference
radiologists (RRs) of the RIVUR trial. Two-way comparisons of concordant and
discrepant responses were analyzed using an unweighted kappa statistic between
the ALR and the adjudicated RR interpretations. All analyses were performed using
SAS v 9.4 (SAS institute 2015) and significance was determined at the 0.05 level.
RESULTS: Of the 2872 kidneys evaluated, adjudicated RR reports had 119 (4%)
kidneys with renal scarring compared with 212 (7%) by the ALRs. For 79% kidneys
the grading for scarring reported by ALRs was either upgraded (24%) or downgraded
(55%) by RRs. For acute pyelonephritis (n = 2924), adjudicated RR reports had 85 
(3%) kidneys with pyelonephritis compared with 151 (5%) by the ALRs. For 85%
kidneys, the grading for pyelonephritis reported by the ALRs was either upgraded 
(28%) or downgraded (57%) by the RRs. A three-way comparison revealed that all
three (RR1, RR2, and ALR) agreed over presence of renal scarring in 19% cases and
two of the three agreed in 80% cases. The respective numbers for pyelonephritis
were 13% and 84%. The agreement rate for all DMSA scan reports between the RRs
and the ALRs was 93%.
DISCUSSION: The study revealed significant interobserver variability in the
reporting of abnormal DMSA renal scans compared with the previously published
studies. A noteworthy limitation was a lack of uniformity in local reporting of
the scans.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the need for optimizing the clinical yield of
DMSA renal scans by more specific guidelines, particularly for standardized and
uniform interpretation.

Recently, various therapeutic strategies in anticancer drug development are
focused to reduce adverse side effects and to enhance the therapeutic efficacy.
Mostly, the iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles have widely been utilized as an
efficient drug delivery system towing to their unique properties such as
excellent magnetic behavior, considerably low toxicity, easy surface modification
and high drug-loading efficacy. In the present study, we synthesized a
multifunctional, DMSA coated, water soluble Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4@DMSA/DOX) 
for an effective pH and NIR-light triggered delivery of anticancer drug (DOX) in 
cancer therapy. The combination of photothermal therapy combined with
chemotherapy results demonstrated that the synthesized Fe3O4@DMSA/DOX is an
excellent candidate for pH- and NIR-light induced phothothermal agent for an
effective delivery of anticancer drug (DOX) into the target sub-cellular level
into the human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells. Furthermore, the Fe3O4@DMSA/DOX 
nanoparticles induced an excellent temperature elevation upon NIR light
irradiation and controlled DOX release in vitro. The Fe3O4@DMSA/DOX nanoparticles
exhibited synergistic effect when combining chemotherapy with photothermal
therapy and showed an excellent cell toxicity to MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition,
the combined chemo-photothermal therapy of Fe3O4@DMSA/DOX nanoparticles promoted 
an effective cell death by mitochondrial disruption mediated by ROS generation.
Thus, the synthesized Fe3O4@DMSA/DOX nanoparticles could be utilized as potential
anticancer agents for breast cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Our objective was to analyze the evolution of kidney damage over time
in small children with urinary tract infection (UTI) and factors associated with 
progression of renal damage.
METHODS: From a cohort of 1003 children <2 years of age with first-time UTI, a
retrospective analysis of 103 children was done. Children were selected because
of renal damage at index (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy at
least 3 months after UTI, and a late DMSA scan was performed after at least
2 years. Damage was classified as progression when there was a decline in
differential renal function (DRF) by ≥4%, as regression when there was complete
or partial resolution of uptake defects.
RESULTS: Of 103 children, 20 showed progression, 20 regression, and 63 remained
unchanged. There were no differences between groups regarding gender or age. In
the progression group, 16/20 (80%) children had vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) grade
III-V and 13 (65%) had recurrent UTI. In multivariable regression analysis, both 
VUR grade III-V and recurrent UTI were associated with progression. In the
regression group, 16/20 (80%) had no VUR or grade I-II, and two (10%) had
recurrent UTI.
CONCLUSIONS: Most small children with febrile UTI do not develop renal damage and
if they do the majority remain unchanged or regress over time. However, up to
one-fifth of children with renal damage diagnosed after UTI are at risk of renal

III-V and recurrent febrile UTI and may benefit from follow-up.

The cluster series Ag4M2(DMSA)4 (M = Ni, Pd, Pt) has been synthesized and the
optical spectra and stability have been examined as a function of the metal, M.
We have also obtained the structure of Ag4Ni2(DMSA)4 using X-ray crystallography,
confirming the previously calculated structure. In the optical spectrum, there is
a significant blue shift as the substituted metal M progresses down the periodic 
table. Theoretical calculations suggest that the blue shift is due to the
lowering in energy of the d orbitals of the transition metal, M; however the
expected metal-metal excitations are optically weak, and the spectra are
dominated by metal-ligand excitations. The Ag4Pd2(DMSA)4 species has
exceptionally high stability relative to the previously reported Ni and Pt
analogues.

We present an interesting image of a well-functioning supernumerary kidney
evaluated with DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) renal scintigraphy in a 14-year-old
girl. At 2 years of age, the patient had a diagnosis of supernumerary kidney. She
remained asymptomatic up to childhood age, and then a DMSA study was required to 
guide the following adequate surveillance strategy. DMSA study provided a clear
imaging of supernumerary kidney in the left side of the abdomen showing a regular
uptake and a normal function in relation to its own size.

Previously, we reported that specific lower dose of sodium
2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) which is an antidote to heavy metal 
intoxication, inversely enhanced cisplatin (CDDP)-induced antitumor activity to
S-180 cell-bearing mouse. This activity was only weak with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), however. This study investigated the
effects of lower doses of DMPS or DMSA on the nephrotoxicity and kinetics of
CDDP. Kidney and blood isolated from female mice which received CDDP with or
without DMPS or DMSA once daily for 4 days were provided for measuring levels of 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and transporter proteins (OCT2: organic cation
transporter; MATE1: multidrug and toxin extrusion) mRNA, and CDDP-originated
platinum, and TUNEL staining of renal tubular cells. DMPS or DMSA reduced
effectively CDDP-induced BUN, and caused a moderate reduction of platinum in
kidney. Additionally, both dimercapto-compounds restored the CDDP-reduced mRNA
levels of transporter proteins (OCT2 and MATE1), and apparently suppressed the
CDDP-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that DMPS, as well as DMSA, at
approximate 17-fold dose (μmol/kg) of CDDP, has an enough potential to reverse
the CDDP nephrotoxicity, and concomitant use of DMPS considering both dose and
timing for administration is potentially useful for preventing nephrotoxicity and
enhancing antitumor activity during CDDP chemotherapy.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most common infectious diseases in
children. Urosepsis in childhood, though rare, is the most complicated possible
variant. In newborns and infants, unspecific symptoms are a significant barrier
to a fast and reliable diagnosis, which is crucial to successful treatment. In
addition to urine and laboratory tests as well as non-invasive examinations
(ultrasound), there may be an indication for invasive examinations of the kidneys
(DMSA scans) in cases of a severe infection. Conservative therapy consists of
targeted parenteral antibiotic treatment and paediatric sepsis management.
Surgical desobstruction and urinary diversion are indicated if conservative
therapy has failed. In addition to catheterised drainage of the upper and lower
urinary tract, open surgery techniques are used in due consideration of the child
and situation. Also, causal factors such as congenital malformations of the
urinary system leading to impaired urinary drainage (vesicoureteral reflux,
obstruction) have to be evaluated and treated.

Publisher: Fieberhafte Harnwegsinfekte (HWI) sind die häufigsten Infektionen im
Kindesalter, die Urosepsis, wenngleich selten, stellt die schwerste Komplikation 
der kindlichen Infektion des Urogenitaltraktes dar. Die korrekte Diagnose,
insbesondere die Mitbeteiligung der Nieren im Säuglings- und Kleinkindesalter
kann aufgrund der unspezifischen Symptome schwierig sein, neben Harn und Labor
sowie nicht invasiver Diagnostik (Ultraschall) kann eine weitere spezifische
Diagnostik (DMSA Szintigrafie) notwendig sein. Die Akuttherapie besteht aus der
gezielten parenteralen Antibiose wie der qualifizierten pädiatrischen
Sepsistherapie, selten ist eine chirurgisch-interventionelle Desobstruktion
nötig. Hier kommen neben der Katheterdrainage des unteren und oberen Harntraktes 
offene Operationstechniken – situations- und kindgerecht – zum Einsatz. Im
weiteren Verlauf ist es entscheidend, kausale Faktoren wie angeborene
Fehlbildungen mit negativem Einfluss auf den Harntransport (vesikoureteraler
Reflux, Fehlbildungen mit postrenaler Obstruktion) zu identifizieren und zu
behandeln.

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been linked to recurrent urinary tract infections
(UTIs), renal scarring, hypertension, renal insufficiency and end-stage kidney
disease. Different imaging strategies have been proposed to approach children
presenting with UTI to sort out patients with significant VUR while minimizing
patient morbidity, radiation exposure and financial burden. None of these imaging
strategies is universally accepted. The"top-down approach" (TDA) aims at
restricting the number of voiding cystourethrograms (VCUGs) and its associated
morbidity while identifying patients with clinically-significant reflux. In this 
approach, children presenting with febrile UTIs are acutely investigated with
dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) renal scans to identify patients with renal
parenchymal inflammation. Those with evidence of renal affection are offered VCUG
and late DMSA scan to identify VUR and permanent renal scarring, respectively.
Although TDA could identify clinically-significant VUR with high sensitivity, it 
is not without limitations. The approach segregates patients based on the
presence of DMSA cortical lesions omitting the morbidity and the economic burden 
of UTI. Additionally, some of DMSA lesions are attributed to congenital dysplasia
and unrelated to UTI. Ionizing radiation exposure, financial costs, limited
availability of DMSA scans in the acute setting, variability in interpreting the 
results and low yield of actionable findings on DMSA scans are some other
limitations. In this review, we tried to address the drawbacks of the TDA and
reinforce the value of patient-centered approach for VUR.

Magnetic nanoparticles can be used in different areas of biology. It is therefore
important to know the effects of such nanomaterials on germline cells as they may
traverse the blood-testis barrier. This work aimed to evaluate the response of
bull sperm after exposure to a magnetic fluid containing DMSA-coated maghemite
nanoparticles (MNP-DMSA) in order to determine nanotoxicity. Bull sperm was
incubated with MNP-DMSA at final concentrations of 0.06, 0.03 or 0.015 mg Fe/mL. 
Sperm kinetics, plasma membrane integrity and acrosome reaction were evaluated
over a 4 h incubation period. The sperm cells were also evaluated by transmission
electron microscopy. Exposure of bull sperm to MNP-DMSA did not affect sperm
kinetics or integrity. Neither ultrastructural damage of sperm cells nor uptake
of nanoparticles by the spermatozoa was observed. In conclusion, MNP-DMSA does
not affect sperm function or structure under the conditions tested.

BACKGROUND: Clinically confirmed incidents of acute pyelonephritis (APN)
following recurrent infections of urinary tract (UTI) form basic risk factors for
renal scarring in children. Vesico-uretheral reflux (VUR) of higher grade is
additional risk factor for this scarring. Opinions on diagnostic value of summed 
sequential images of renal uptake phase (SUM) of dynamic renal scintigraphy in
detection of renal scars are diverse. However, several publications point to
higher diagnostic efficacy of clearance parametric images (PAR) generated from
this study.
THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To establish a clinical value of parametric renal clearance
images in detection of renal scarring.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was performed in a group of 91 children
at the age of 4 to 18 years with recurrent UTI. Clinically documented incidents
of APN were noted in 32 children: in 8 cases - one and in the remaining 24 - 2 to
5 (mean 3) incidents. In the remaining 59 patients only infections of the lower
part of urinary tract were diagnosed. Static renal 99mTc-DMSA SPECT study and
after 2-4 days dynamic renal studies (99mTc-EC) were performed in every patient
not earlier than 6 months after the last documented incident of UTI. PAR images
generated from a dynamic study by in-house developed software and SUM images were
compared with a gold standard SPECT study.
RESULTS: Percentages of children with detected renal scar(s) with SPECT and PAR
methods amounted to 55% and 54%, respectively and were statistically
significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than with SUM method - 31%. Scars in children
with history of APN detected with SPECT and PAR methods were significantly more
frequent than with infections of only lower part of urinary tract (72% vs. 46%; p
= 0.017 and 69% vs. 46%; p = 0.036, respectively). A SUM method did not reveal
statistically significant differences between frequencies of detection of scars
in groups specified above - 38% vs. 27% (p = 0.31). Both SPECT and PAR methods
showed also that frequencies of occurrence of renal scars in children with higher
grades of VUR were higher than without or with lower grades of VUR: 79% vs. 50%
(p = 0.048) and 79% vs. 49% (p = 0.04). A SUM method did not reveal higher
frequency of renal scars in children with high VUR grades: 36% vs. 30% (p =
0.44).
CONCLUSION: Results obtained with PAR and SPECT methods were similar. An
advantage of PAR over SUM images obtained from a dynamic renal scintigraphy in
detection of renal scars in children with UTI was confirmed.

CONTEXT: The differential cortical function obtained by Tc-99m EC is comparable
to that of Tc-99m DMSA. However, identification of scars on Tc-99m EC images
needs to be studied.
AIMS: The aim of the study is to evaluate role of Tc-99m EC for detection of
scarring and differential cortical function by comparing with Tc-99m DMSA.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Prospective observational study of recurrent UTI; minimum 6 
weeks after acute episode; when urine examination is negative for pus cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven children with normal positioned kidneys
underwent Tc-99m EC and DMSA scintigraphy. The DRF and cortical phase images of
both studies in the same image matrix size were evaluated by two independent
observers for scarring; Tc-99m DMSA was considered as the gold standard.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: MS Excel 2007 and GraphPad Instat V3.1 and ROC
analysis.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the detection of scarring using
two studies with Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) 0.932. The sensitivity and
specificity of Tc-99m EC for detection of scarring was 98.75% and 99.15%,
respectively. There was good agreement between the differential cortical function
calculated using two studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The summed Tc-99m EC images with an acceptable high image contrast
allow detection of cortical scarring in patients with normal kidney positions. It
is an excellent single-modality comprehensive investigational agent for renal
parenchymal defects, function, and excretion evaluation with the added advantages
of lower cost, convenience, and low radiation exposure to the child.

Type IV renal tubular acidosis is known to occur in obstructive uropathy with
urinary tract infection. Fanconi syndrome, however, has not been described in
these settings. We report two preterm infants who developed Fanconi syndrome
associated with hydronephrosis and urinary tract infection. Patient 1 is a boy
with 21 trisomy, bilateral renal hypoplasia and bilateral vesicoureteral reflux
delivered at 35 weeks' gestation. At postnatal day 42, he developed Fanconi
syndrome after urinary tract infection, which persisted until the surgical
correction of vesicoureteral reflux. Patient 2 was delivered at 35 weeks'
gestation. At postnatal day 9, he was admitted for severe dehydration. He had
phimosis and ultrasonography showed left pelviectasis. Laboratory data were
compatible with Fanconi syndrome, which resolved spontaneously after fluid
therapy. Subsequently urine culture grew bacteria and treatment for infection and
topical corticosteroid for phimosis were performed. DMSA scintigraphy performed
later showed left renal scar. Tubular cell stretch, due to vesicoureteral reflux 
in Patient 1 and phimosis in Patient 2, and urinary tract infection in
association with immaturity of tubules are thought to have caused Fanconi
syndrome.

AIM: This study is aimed to evaluate the predictive value of the
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for cortical defect on initial and follow-up
Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan in children with the first febrile
urinary tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 179 children with the first febrile UTI who 
underwent DMSA scan and laboratory tests. In patients with abnormal DMSA scan
findings, follow-up DMSA scan was performed at least 6 months after the initial
scan. All DMSA scans were classified as negative and positive cortical defects.
Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors
for cortical defect on initial and follow-up DMSA scan.
RESULTS: Cortical defects on initial DMSA scan were noted in 133 patients.
Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count,
NLR, and serum C-reactive protein level were independent predictive factors for
positive cortical defect on initial DMSA scan (p < 0.050). On follow-up DMSA
scan, 24 of the 133 patients showed persistent cortical defects, and only VUR was
significantly associated with persistent cortical defect (p = 0.002). In 84
patients who showed cortical defect on initial scan and absence of VUR, only NLR 
was significantly associated with persistent cortical defect on follow-up scan
(p = 0.025).
CONCLUSION: NLR was significantly associated with persistent cortical defect on
follow-up DMSA scan in patients without VUR, as well as positive cortical defect 
on initial scan.

of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, BiH.

OBJECTIVE: This study objective was to evaluate interobserver agreement between
individual pairs of three nuclear medicine physicians in interpretation of renal 
cortical scintigraphy in children with respect to the mode of acquisition (planar
vs. SPECT), diagnoses and kidney site (left vs. right).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty children were imaged in planar and SPECT mode per
protocol upon the injection of Tc-99m DMSA dose adjusted to their body weight.
Patients were classified according to diagnoses into four groups. Three nuclear
medicine physicians interpreted the findings blindly and independently. Renal
defects were interpreted as focal and diffuse, per three renal segments. For the 
raters we calculated simple percentage agreement, the Cohen kappa statistic with 
95% confidence intervals, and the overall kappa defining the levels of
reliability as almost perfect or perfect, substantial, moderate, fair and slight 
agreement.
RESULTS: Interobserver agreement in planar interpretation was 77,2% (kappa=0.59; 
95% confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.75) and SPECT 72,9% (kappa= 0,57; 95%
confidence interval, 0,41 to 0,72). In planar interpretation, all individual
pairs had moderate agreements except one that had a substantial agreement. In
SPECT, all the pairs had moderate agreements except one that had an almost
perfect agreement. Overall agreement per kidney site was on planar 73,4% for the 
left (kappa=0,54, moderate agreement), and 81,1% for the right kidney (kappa
0,63, substantial agreement). On SPECT, there was 72,2% agreement for the left
(kappa=0,59, mode rate agreement), and 73,7% for the right kidney (kappa=0,54,
moderate agreement). Overall agreement per diagnoses ranged from 70-88,9% on
planar (kappa= -0,04 to 0,79), and 50-100% on SPECT (kappa=-0,02-1,000)
indicating agreements from slight to substantial.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest acceptable levels of interobserver agreement in
all individual pairs of raters with respect to the mode of acquisition (planar
vs. SPECT), diagnoses and kidney site (left vs. right). For the mode of
acquisition, we would recommend hybrid imaging SPECT/CT method to be used
whenever possible in the detection of renal cortical defects on Tc-99m-DMSA
scintigraphy.

Controversies Regarding Management of Vesico-ureteric Reflux.

The primary goal in the management of a child with urinary tract infection (UTI) 
is to prevent recurrence of UTI and acquired renal damage. Approximately 15% of
children develop renal scarring after a first episode of febrile UTI.
Vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) is diagnosed in 30-40% of children imaged after
first febrile UTI. The 'top-down' approach involving ultrasound and
dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA) first after an appropriate interval following
UTI, can help in avoiding voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), an invasive test with 
higher radiation exposure. The majority view remains that VCUG should be done
after the second attack of UTI in girls and first attack of UTI in boys. Although
the evidence in favour of antibiotic prophylaxis remains doubtful in preventing
renal scars associated with VUR, it remains the first line treatment for
high-grade reflux (grade 3-5) with an aim to prevent UTI and allow spontaneous
resolution of VUR. Early identification and appropriate treatment of associated
bowel bladder dysfunction is an essential part of successful medical management
of VUR. Endoscopic treatment of VUR, using a bulking agent, is useful in grade 3 
VUR. The main controversy regarding intervention (endoscopic/open surgical
intervention) involves absence of strong evidence for these interventions in
reducing renal scarring on randomized controlled trials. However, several recent 
trials have found the surgical interventions to be effective in reducing
recurrent pyelonephritis and repeated hospital admissions.

technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy,
as a non-invasive method, with common biochemical and histopathological methods
in two animal models of acute kidney injury. Nephrotoxicity was induced either by
gentamicin (100 mg/kg/day for one week) or unilateral ureteral ligation (UUO).
Renal scintigraphy was performed 1 h after intravenous injection of 99mTc-DMSA
(3 mCi). Furthermore, plasma levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine,
sodium, and potassium were determined using an autoanalyzer. At the end of
experiments, kidneys were excised for the measurement of activity uptake (mCi/gr)
using a dose calibrator as well as histopathological examinations with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. There was a significant decrease in
99mTc-DMSA uptake in both gentamicin (P value = 0.049) and UUO (P value = 0.034) 
groups, and it was more significant in the former. The levels of BUN and
creatinine increased in both gentamicin and UUO groups, while the levels of
sodium and potassium remained unchanged. Furthermore, a strong correlation was
found between DMSA uptake and histopathological findings. Scintigraphy with
99mTc-DMSA is capable of detection of kidney injury in both gentamicin and UUO
groups. Moreover, a significant correlation was found between scintigraphy
parameters and histopathological findings. This suggests 99mTc-DMSA as a
non-invasive method for the evaluation of kidney injury induced by drugs or
anatomical disorders.

The Raman spectrum (3700-100cm(-1)) of meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid
(meso-DMSA; C4H6O4S2) was recorded in the solid phase using 514.5 and 785nm
excitation lines. Whereas, the DRIFT spectrum (4000-400cm(-1)) of the sample
powdered in KBr was obtained. Moreover, DFT-B3LYP/6-31G(d) geometry optimization 
and frequency calculations were carried out for centrosymmetric trans (Ci),
gauche (C1; G(+)/G(-)) and eclipsed (Cs; Ef and C1; E(+)/E(-)) rotational isomers
in favor of a trans conformation, the least energy with real frequencies.
However, other conformers were found at either local minima or local maxima as a 
result of the rotation of carboxyl, hydroxyl and thiol groups according to a
potential energy surface scan. Moreover, an imaginary wavenumber was predicted;
therefore, they are considered transition states. On the other hand, the mass
spectrum of the sample dissolved in an acetonitrile/methanol mixture reveal 4-6% 
dimer through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions via the dicarboxylic
groups. Therefore, we have modeled the complex structure obeying Ci restricted
symmetry for an isolated dimer unit using DFT-B3LYP/6-31G(d) and for two
molecules per unit cell in the solid phase implementing DFT-PBE functional. Thus,
the meso-DMSA forms long strands in which individual molecules are bonded
together at each termini through hydrogen bonding. Aided by normal coordinate
analysis, complete vibrational assignments were provided herein which support Ci 
configuration of meso-DMSA in the solid state which found consistent with the
observed broadening, composite, split bands, and the mutual exclusion rule.

In the context of ante-natally diagnosed hydronephrosis, the vast majority of
children with a dilated renal pelvis do not need any surgical treatment, as the
dilatation resolves spontaneously with time. Slow drainage demonstrated at
Tc-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) renography does not necessarily mean
obstruction. Obstruction is defined as resistance to urinary outflow with urinary
stasis at the level of the pelvic-ureteric junction (PUJ) which, if left
untreated, will damage the kidney. Unfortunately this definition is retrospective
and not clinically helpful. Therefore, the identification of the kidney at risk
of losing function in an asymptomatic patient is a major research goal. In the
context of renovascular hypertension a DMSA scan can be useful before and after
revascularisation procedures (angioplasty or surgery) to assess for gain in
kidney function. Renal calculi are increasingly frequent in children. Whilst the 
vast majority of patients with renal stones do not need functional imaging, DMSA 
scans with SPECT and a low dose limited CT can be very helpful in the case of
complex renal calculi. Congenital renal anomalies such as duplex kidneys,
horseshoe kidneys, crossed-fused kidneys and multi-cystic dysplastic kidneys
greatly benefit from functional imaging to identify regional parenchymal
function, thus directing further management. Positron emission tomography (PET)
is being actively tested in genito-urinary malignancies. Encouraging initial
reports suggest that F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET is more sensitive than CT 
in the assessment of lymph nodal metastases in patients with genito-urinary
sarcomas; an increased sensitivity in comparison to isotope bone scans for
skeletal metastatic disease has also been reported. Further evaluation is
necessary, especially with the promising advent of PET/MRI scanners. Nuclear
Medicine in paediatric nephro-urology has stood the test of time and is opening
up to new exciting developments.

OBJECTIVES: Ureterocele management is considered to be one of the famous debates 
in pediatric urology. Despite some considering transurethral ureterocele incision
(TUI) as a temporary line of treatment, others have reported good results in
terms of being a definitive treatment. The present study evaluated the
feasibility of TUI as a definitive line of management. Moreover, it studied the
impact of presentation on the outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of patients who had ureteroceles from 1995 to
2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who had undergone initial TUI were
included. The initial presentation and timing were recorded. All ultrasounds,
voiding cystourethrograms (VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid scans (DMSA) pre-TUI
and post-TUI were reviewed. Moreover, the occurrence of febrile urinary tract
infections (FUTI) and any secondary surgical intervention were recorded. RESULTS 
(FIG. A): A total of 51 patients with 53 ureteroceles were included. Of these,
51% presented antenatally, while others had FUTI at the time of presentation.
Thirty-nine ureteroceles were associated with duplex system ureterocele (DSU),
while the remaining ones had single system ureterocele (SSU). The median
follow-up was 44 months. The incidence of de-novo reflux into ureterocele was 44%
of SSU and 23% of DSU (P = 0.22). Reflux into ureterocele after TUI (four SSU and
seven DSU) carried a high risk of surgical interventions (3/4 SSU and 6/7 DSU).
Hydronephrosis was improved in 64% of both DSU and SSU patients. Secondary
surgery was performed in 51% of DSU and 35.7% of SSU. Twelve patients (67%)
presented postnatally with DSU and had subsequent interventions after incision in
comparison with 38% (eight patients) of those who presented antenatally. The DSU 
had improved renal function (by DMSA) in 26%, while the remaining had stable
renal function.
DISCUSSION: All patients with delayed ureterocele presentation had FUTI, while
1/3 of antenatally presenting patients had FUTI during follow-up. Notably, the
age at subsequent interventions was apparently the same despite different ages at
presentation. Study limitations included the retrospective chart review.
Additionally, the pre-operative and postoperative investigations, such as
laboratory and radiological results, were present and reviewed in most, but not
all, patients.
CONCLUSION: Two thirds of SSU and approximately half DSU patients had no surgical
intervention after TUI. However, those who presented antenatally had a lower risk
of FUTI and lesser probability of being re-operated. VUR into ureterocele,
regardless the system duplicity, had a high re-operation rate. After ureterocele 
incision, 26% of DSU patients had renal function improvement.

Currently, there is a large interest in the labeling of neural stem cells (NSCs) 
with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) to allow MRI-guided detection after
transplantation in regenerative medicine. For such biomedical applications,
excluding nanotoxicity is key. Nanosafety is primarily evaluated in vitro where
an immortalized or cancer cell line of murine origin is often applied, which is
not necessarily an ideal cell model. Previous work revealed clear neurotoxic
effects of PMA-coated IONPs in distinct cell types that could potentially be
applied for nanosafety studies regarding neural cell labeling. Here, we aimed to 
assess if DMSA-coated IONPs could be regarded as a safer alternative for this
purpose and how the cell model impacted our nanosafety optimization study.
Hereto, we evaluated cytotoxicity, ROS production, calcium levels, mitochondrial 
homeostasis and cell morphology in six related neural cell types, namely neural
stem cells, an immortalized cell line and a cancer cell line from human and
murine origin. The cell lines mostly showed similar responses to both IONPs,
which were frequently more pronounced for the PMA-IONPs. Of note, ROS and calcium
levels showed opposite trends in the human and murine NSCs, indicating the
importance of the species. Indeed, the human cell models were overall more
sensitive than their murine counterpart. Despite the clear cell type-specific
nanotoxicity profiles, our multiparametric approach revealed that the DMSA-IONPs 
outperformed the PMA-IONPs in terms of biocompatibility in each cell type.
However, major cell type-dependent variations in the observed effects
additionally warrant the use of relevant human cell models.STATEMENT OF
SIGNIFICANCE: Inorganic nanoparticle (NP) optimization is chiefly performed in
vitro. For the optimization of iron oxide (IO)NPs for neural stem cell labeling
in the context of regenerative medicine human or rodent neural stem cells,
immortalized or cancer cell lines are applied. However, the use of certain cell
models can be questioned as they phenotypically differ from the target cell. The 
impact of the neural cell model on nanosafety remains relatively unexplored. Here
we evaluated cell homeostasis upon exposure to PMA- and DMSA-coated IONPs. Of
note, the DMSA-IONPs outperformed the PMA-IONPs in each cell type. However,
distinct cell type-specific effects were witnessed, indicating that nanosafety
should be evaluated in a human cell model that represents the target cell as
closely as possible.

BACKGROUND: Acute-phase technetium-99 m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy is recommended for initial imaging in children with febrile urinary 
tract infection (fUTI). Recently, the importance of identifying patients at risk 
of recurrent fUTI (r-fUTI) has been emphasized. To clarify the effectiveness of
DMSA scintigraphy for predicting r-fUTI in infants, we investigated the
relationship between defects on DMSA scintigraphy and r-fUTI.
METHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive infants (male: female, 60:19) with fUTI were
enrolled in this study. DMSA scintigraphy was performed in the acute phase, and
patients with defect underwent voiding cystourethrography and chronic-phase
(6 months later) DMSA scintigraphy. Patients were followed on continuous
antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP).
RESULTS: Defects on acute-phase DMSA scintigraphy were observed in 32 children
(40.5%) of 79. The mean follow-up observation period was 17.0 ± 10.1 months. Four
patients had r-fUTI (5%). Two of them had defects on DMSA scintigraphy in both
the acute phase and chronic phase, and had bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) 
grade IV. Two others had r-fUTI without defects on DMSA and did not have VUR.
Twelve patients had defect on chronic-phase DMSA scintigraphy and four of them
had no VUR.
CONCLUSIONS: The top-down approach is a possible method for predicting r-fUTI in 
infants and does not miss clinically significant VUR. Also, given that the
prevalence of r-fUTI was 5% regardless of the presence of defects on acute-phase 
DMSA, then, in conjunction with genital hygiene and CAP, acute-phase DMSA might
be unnecessary if chronic-phase DMSA is performed for all patients to detect
renal scar.

In this study, Co3O4 nanopolyhedrons, nanocubes, nanoplates and nanorods were
synthesized and characterized. Furthermore, the peroxidase- and catalase-like
activities of these Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were studied and influence of the
exposed crystal planes was explored. According to their morphology and
peroxidase-like activity, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) modified Co3O4
nanopolyhedrons synthesized via coprecipitation method (Co3O4 NHs) were selected 
as a proper candidate for the immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
tissues. Bivalent cobalt ions were coupled to the carboxyls on the surface of the
obtained Co3O4 NHs so as to chelate the hexahistidine residues (His-Tags) at the 
C-terminal of EGFR single-domain antibodies (EGFR sdAbs). Finally, the
as-obtained EGFR sdAbs-binding Co3O4 NHs (Co3O4 nanoprobes) were successfully
applied to the detection of EGFR expression in NSCLC tissues.

Asymptomatic spontaneous nephrocutaneous fistula is a rare and severe
complication of chronic urolithiasis. We report a case of 56-year-old woman with 
a nephrocutaneous fistula (NFC) which developed from a superinfected urinoma
following calyceal rupture due to an obstructing calculus in the left ureter. The
patient was clinically asymptomatic and came to the emergency department for a
painless left flank fluctuating mass. This urinoma was superinfected, with a
delayed development of renal abscesses and perirenal phlegmon found on
contrast-enhanced uro-computed tomography (CT), responsible for left renal vein
thrombophlebitis and left psoas abscess. Thereafter, a 99 mTc dimercaptosuccinic 
acid (DMSA) scintigraphy revealed a nonfunctional left kidney, leading to the
decision of left nephrectomy. Chronic urolithiasis complications are rare and
only few cases are reported in medical literature. A systematic medical approach 
helped selecting the best imaging modality to help diagnosis and treatment.
Indeed, uro-CT scan and renal scintigraphy with 99 mTc-DMSA are the most
sensitive imaging modalities to investigate morphological and functional urinary 
tract consequences of NFC, secondary to chronic urolithiasis.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether operative techniques and other variables related to
patient and renal stone characteristics affect potential renal parenchymal
damage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population comprised 64 patients who underwent
percutaneous nephrolithotomy operations (PCNL). Data of the operated renal units,
renal stone burden, route and number of entries, dilation techniques, duration of
surgery, preoperative and postoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and
relative dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptakes, as well as the changes in
hemoglobin values, were recorded and analyzed for all patients.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 44 years. In 11 (17.1%) cases, renal
cortical defects in the 3rd month were detected on DMSA scintigraphy. When the
patients with and without renal cortical defect were compared regarding their
preoperative and postoperative GFR values, no statistically significant
difference was noticed between the groups (P > 0.05). Similarly, when
postoperative relative DMSA uptakes were compared with preoperative relative DMSA
uptakes of the same kidneys, no statistical significance was seen. When
preoperative relative DMSA uptake values between groups with and without renal
scarring were compared, no statistically significant difference was observed (P >
0.05).
CONCLUSION: We did not observe any significant difference in scintigraphic
parameters and GFR values. Hence, in the current trial, significant loss in renal
function after PCNL operations was not observed. Thus, PCNL operations should be 
regarded as safe, but still, the risk of loss of kidney function should always be
considered.

Sodium fluoride-based β-NaLnF4 nanoparticles (NPs) doped with lanthanide ions are
promising materials for application as luminescent markers in bio-imaging. In
this work, the effect of NPs doped with yttrium (Y), gadolinium (Gd), europium
(Eu), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb) and terbium (Tb) ions on phagocytic activity
of monocytes and granulocytes and the respiratory burst was examined. The surface
functionalization of <10-nm NPs was performed according to our variation of
patent pending ligand exchange method that resulted in
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) molecules on their surface. Y-core-based 
NCs were doped with Eu ions, which enabled them to be excited with UV light
wavelengths. Cultures of human peripheral blood (n = 8) were in vitro treated
with five different concentrations of eight NPs for 24 h. In summary, neither
type of nanoparticles is found toxic with respect to conducted test; however,
some cause toxic effects (they have statistically significant deviations compared
to reference) in some selected doses tested. Both core types of NPs (Y-core and
Gd-core) impaired the phagocytic activity of monocytes the strongest, having
minimal or none whatsoever influence on granulocytes and respiratory burst of
phagocytic cells. The lowest toxicity was observed in Gd-core, Yb, Tm dopants and
near-infrared nanoparticles. Clear dose-dependent effect of NPs on phagocytic
activity of leukocytes and respiratory burst of cells was observed for limited
number of samples.

OBJECTIVES: Lead (Pb) pollution is a serious public health problem all over the
world, it especially plays severe damage role in children's health. Apart from
reducing lead-induced damages, the decrease of lead accumulation is also
critical. This study has been the first attempt to investigate effects of
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), potassium iodide (KI) and chlorophyll
(Chl) on lead accumulation in male mice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty healthy Kunming male mice were selected and divided 
randomly into 8 groups. They were treated with lead acetate (PbAc)
intraperitoneally, individually and in combination with the DMSA, KI or Chl once 
daily for 5 days. Meanwhile, the control group was treated with normal saline
during the whole exposure period. On 30th day, mice were sacrificed and lead
concentrations were detected in the whole blood, livers, kidneys, and testicles
of mice by means of the graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry.
RESULTS: In comparison with the control group, lead concentrations increased in
mice treated with the PbAc and DMSA, KI and Chl diminished lead accumulation in
the whole blood, livers, and kidneys. Chl had specifically the same effects on
lead concentrations in the testicles of male mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Potassium iodide and Chl, as food additives, had the same effects as
the DMSA to reduce lead accumulation in male mice effectively. Our results
provided experimental evidence in vivo for the preventive measures of lead
poisoning. Int J Occup Med Environ Health 2017;30(1):87-93.

INTRODUCTION: The proactive management of children with myelomeningocele (MMC)
has contributed to decreasing their progression to end-stage renal disease,
thanks to early urological evaluation and timing implementation of treatments.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that early urological evaluation of the urinary tract
in MMC shows functional alterations in most cases, and that it requires medical
intervention, even when in some cases the complementary imaging studies do not
show any abnormalities.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study including 60 patients aged <1 year
with MMC who were followed by a multidisciplinary team. All of them underwent
renal/bladder ultrasound, videourodynamic studies, renal
scintigraphy/dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), and laboratory tests for kidney
function. The studied variables were: bladder capacity and pressure, presence of 
overactivity, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), urinary dilations and abnormalities on
renal scintigraphy/DMSA. All the patients received clean intermittent
catheterization (CIC).
RESULTS: See Summary Table all the patients showed alterations in at least some
of the assessed urodynamic variables: reduced cystometric capacity, 21.6%;
detrusor overactivity, 55%; end filling detrusor pressure >20 cm H2O, 43.3%;
inefficient bladder voiding, 98.3%; indirect dyssynergic patterns, 28.8%. The
high-risk videourodynamic findings were observed in 28 cases (46.6%). DMSA was
abnormal in 30%. Renal impairment was detected in 6.6% of cases. A total of 66%
of cases received oxybutynin.
DISCUSSION: Almost all the children in this sample population showed urinary
dysfunction, and approximately half of them had high-risk videourodynamic
findings. Although many cases showed reflex urinary contractions, almost the
entire sample had inefficient bladder voiding. An important limitation of this
work was the lack of simultaneity in obtaining each of the requested studies.
CONCLUSIONS: In the initial urological evaluation of patients with
myelomeningocele, almost all the urodynamic studies showed abnormalities and
one-third showed abnormal DMSA, which led to therapeutic actions being initiated,
although imaging studies were normal in a great number of patients. CIC alone,
starting immediately after birth, is not sufficient. To eliminate or decrease
upper tract damage, oxybutynin should be started in addition.

Back ground: UTI is a common and important clinical problem in Iranian children
which is often difficult on clinical grounds. Distinguishing the upper UTI from
lower UTI is very important for clinician. The aim of this study was to determine
the usefulness of serum STREM-1 level in patients with UTI to find out if it can 
use for distinguishing upper UTI from lower UTI or not.METHODS: In this
prospective cross sectional study (2010-2011) we compared the serum level of
STREM-1 (pg. /ml) in 36 proven UTI cases (24 upper and 12 lower UTI ) with 25
normal children (without UTI) in Rasoul Akram hospital Tehran, Iran. The mean age
of the subjects was 3.64 + years; 24 male and 37 female. Urinary analysis and
culture were performed for all UTI cases and only the positive cultured cases
with the same microorganism were enrolled in the study. Distinguishing the upper 
from lower UTI was done with the use of clinical signs and laboratory tests and
confirmed Imaging studies (sonography /or DMSA scan). Blood sampling drawn from
all children and centrifuged.STREM-1 level (pg /ml) in serum was measured by
quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique (Human TREM-1 immunoassay,
Quantikine, R&D systems, Minneapolis; USA). A ROC curve was constructed to
illustrate various cut-offs of STREM-1 levels in differentiating between groups. 
Chi square values of CI! 95 %, p<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: There was significant difference in the mean of STREM-1 level between
overall cases of UTI (427.72pg/ml) and controls (124.24 pg. /ml) P value =0.000, 
but it had not significantly difference between upper and lower UTI (500pg/ml vs.
283 pg. /ml, P value=0.1) A ROC curve analysis showed that the maximum power of
sTREM-1 to discriminate between upper and lower UTI patients was 0.68 , the
cutoff point 132 pg./ml had 83.3% sensitivity ;and 60 % specificity to
distinguish upper UTI from lower UTI, but the maximum power of STREM-1 to
discriminate between UTI patients and normal children was 0.76 , the cutoff point
111.5 pg./ml had 83.3% sensitivity; and 60 % specificity to distinguish UTI
normal children Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that even low amount of serum 
STREM-1 (111.5 pg./ml ) has 83.3% sensitivity ;and 60 % specificity to
distinguish the UTI from normal cases (P value =0.000) .But higher level (132
pg./ml ) was needed for definite diagnosis (83.3% sensitivity; 60 % specificity) 
of upper from lower UTI. It concluded that serum STREM-1 level test is a valuable
tool for early distinction the normal cases with false positive urine culture, or
in highly suspicious upper UTI cases with false negative urine culture. Indeed
higher titer of it could be helpful for discriminate the upper from lower UTI .So
we prefer to add this new biologic marker (STREM-1) to previous ones (CRP, PCT)
to prevent the unnecessary hospital admission and empiric antibiotic therapy.

Delta neutrophil index (DNI) is the fraction of circulating immature
granulocytes, which reflects severe bacterial infections and septic condition but
has not been studied in urinary tract infection (UTI). Here, we evaluated the
value of DNI in predicting acute pyelonephritis (APN) or vesicoureteral reflux
(VUR) using the data of 288 patients. Conventional inflammatory markers (white
blood cell [WBC] count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein 
[CRP]), and DNI were measured. WBC, CRP, ESR and DNI were higher in APN than in
lower UTI (p < 0.01). Multiple logistic-regression analyses showed that DNI was a
predictive factor for areas of lack of uptake on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scans (P < 0.01). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) was 
also high for DNI (0.622, 95% CI 0.558-0.687, P < 0.01) as well as for CRP
(0.731, 95% CI 0.673-0.789, P < 0.01) for the prediction of DMSA defects. DNI
demonstrated the highest area under the ROC curve for diagnosis of VUR (0.620,
95% CI 0.542-0.698, P < 0.01). To the best of our knowledge, this is a first
study demonstrating that DNI can be used as a diagnostic marker to distinguish
APN from lower UTI and function as a diagnostic marker indicative of VUR compared
to other conventional markers.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most common bacterial infections in
children. The symptoms are not very specific and range from abdominal pain, poor 
feeding to nocturnal urinary incontinence. The technique of collecting urine
plays an important role for securing the diagnosis. The best way to obtain urine 
in non-toilet-trained children is catheterization or suprapubic bladder
aspiration. In toilet-trained children midstream urine is an acceptable
alternative after cleaning the foreskin or labia. In the case of an infection
a prompt empirical antibiotic therapy is necessary to reduce the risk of
parenchymal scarring of the kidneys. There are different approaches to diagnose
vesicoureteral reflux in different countries. The commonly used standard approach
in Germany is voiding cystourethrography. In the case of reflux
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy should be performed additionally to
exclude renal scarring (bottom-up approach).

This project aimed to develop and characterize a new nanoadsorbent for
hemoperfusion. Fe3O4 nanoparticles synthesized by a facile solvothermal method
were coated with SiO2 and further modified by DMSA. TEM, XRD, FTIR, XPS and SEM
were performed before and after lead adsorption to reveal the general performance
and adsorption mechanism. Rabbit lead poisoning models were established to study 
the adsorption rate; then, a pig hemoperfusion experiment was used for further
validation. In addition, coagulation, liver, kidney and heart function, blood
lipids, electrolytes and the immune inflammatory system were studied before and
after hemoperfusion. The results indicated that the materials had a high
adsorption rate and chemisorbed lead mainly in the plasma. No obvious
coagulation-fibrinolysis, organ toxicity, electrolyte disturbances, inflammatory 
reactions or immunosuppression was observed. The excellent blood compatibility
and high biosafety of this material demonstrate its potential as a new type of
hemoperfusion adsorbent.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common type of female cancer
worldwide and represents 14% of cancer-related deaths in women. Early detection
is the most important factor for treatment and prognosis of breast cancer. In
most countries, the women are currently screened with mammography only. Even
though there has been considerable progress in the detection, surgical therapy,
hormonal and target therapy of breast cancer, there are about ∼ 3500 000 women
who die from breast cancer each year. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
explore the new techniques for early detection of breast cancer. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to improve breast cancer detection at
an early stage because of its higher sensitivity. Glucose transporter (Glut) is a
cellular transmembrane receptor that plays key roles in cell glucose metabolism
and over-expressed in breast cancer cells. 2-deoxy-D-glucose having a similar
structure to D-glucose can specifically interact with Glut.
METHODS: In the present study, we constructed a 2-deoxy-D-glucose-functionalized 
superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles that coated with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs). The aim of this study is 
to evaluate the efficacy of new constructed MRI contrast agent (γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG
NPs) in detecting human breast cancers.
RESULTS: Our results showed that breast cancer cells MDA-MD-231, MCF7 and ZR-75-1
had a high uptake rate of γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs than human breast fibroblast cell
HUM-CELL-0056. There was a significant difference of T2 relaxation times and
signal intensity between breast cancer cells and human breast fibroblast cells
labeled with γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs when MIR.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs may be used as a new
MRI contrast agent for detection of breast cancer.

Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) have been
explored for different kinds of applications in biomedicine, mechanics, and
information. Here, we explored the synthetic SPIO NPs as an adjuvant on antigen
cross-presentation ability by enhancing the intracellular delivery of antigens
into antigen presenting cells (APCs). Particles with different chemical
modifications and surface charges were used to study the mechanism of action of
antigen delivery. Specifically, two types of magnetic NPs, γFe2O3/APTS
(3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane) NPs and γFe2O3/DMSA (meso-2, 3-Dimercaptosuccinic
acid) NPs, with the same crystal structure, magnetic properties, and size
distribution were prepared. Then, the promotion of T-cell activation via
dendritic cells (DCs) was compared among different charged antigen coated NPs.
Moreover, the activation of the autophagy, cytosolic delivery of the antigens,
and antigen degradation mediated by the proteasome and lysosome were measured.
Our results indicated that positive charged γFe2O3/APTS NPs, but not negative
charged γFe2O3/DMSA NPs, enhanced the cross-presentation ability of DCs.
Increased cross-presentation ability induced by γFe2O3/APTS NPs was associated
with increased cytosolic antigen delivery. On the contrary, γFe2O3/DMSA NPs was
associated with rapid autophagy. Overall, our results suggest that antigen
delivered in cytoplasm induced by positive charged particles is beneficial for
antigen cross-presentation and T-cell activation. NPs modified with different
chemistries exhibit diverse biological properties and differ greatly in their
adjuvant potentials. Thus, it should be carefully considered many different
effects of NPs to design effective and safe adjuvants.

INTRODUCTION: It has become clear that obesity is associated with a variety of
infectious diseases, including urinary tract infection (UTI) and renal scarring.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between obesity 
and the degree of febrile UTI (fUTI) and renal scarring in children with
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and to stratify the results into obesity
subcategories.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 186 patients were diagnosed with VUR between January
2002 and December 2008. This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records
of 72 children with primary VUR who had recurrent fUTI (more than twice).
Overweight or obese status of the patients aged <2 years was defined using
weight-for-length (WFL) measurements. For 2-5 year old children, body mass index 
(BMI) percentile-for-age was used. They were divided into three groups as
follows; standard (<85%), overweight (85-95%), and obese (≥95%). The following
clinical variables were compared: age at diagnosis of primary VUR (months), sex, 
VUR grade, hydronephrosis grade, presence of renal scarring, surgical treatment, 
and degree of inflammation during fUTI.
RESULTS: In the overweight and obese groups, VUR was diagnosed at a young age
(P = 0.05), the degree of renal scarring was more severe (P = 0.006), and serum
white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR) levels were significantly higher (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001,
respectively). Abnormal focal dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) defects were present
in 25 of the 72 children (35%). Cortical defects occurred more frequently in
children with obesity, and they were associated with a higher grade of reflux and
serum ESR levels (P = 0.007, P = 0.042, and P = 0.021, respectively). Among these
risk factors, high-grade VUR (OR = 9.93, 95% CI = 1.13-86.71), and being
overweight and obese (OR = 5.26, 95% CI = 1.75-15.82) were associated with
increased renal scarring. However, ESR was not associated with renal scarring
(OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.95-1.07).
DISCUSSION: The relationships between obesity and UTI are controversial. Some
studies have shown positive results; however, other studies have shown opposite
results. The main limitations of this study were the retrospective data
collection via electronic medical records, and the small number of subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that obesity in patients with VUR has an effect on
fUTI and renal scar formation. If the patients with VUR have obesity, close
follow-up should be performed, and VUR patients should be started on a
weight-loss program, which could reduce the number of patients with chronic
kidney disease in the future.

The Effect of Antiseptic on 99mTc-DMSA Scans.

University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.

Approximately 30 years ago, it has been suggested that chlorhexidine, which is
used as antiseptic, can produce Tc colloid complex during Tc-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) preparation. However, in all cases of liver and spleen uptake in
Tc-DMSA scan, it should still be kept in mind because of the introduction of new 
antiseptic brands with different formulation under various names. Our case is
just a sample of this effect, which resulted from application of a new brand of
antiseptic by technologists in our center that unintentionally led to low-quality
Tc-DMSA scans for a period, and after restrict control of all other confounding
factors in the preparation of kit, it was just resolved by changing antiseptic to
ethanol.

Multifunctional nanotheranostic agents have been highly commended due to the
application to image-guided cancer therapy. Herein, based on the chemically
disordered face centered cubic (fcc) FePt nanoparticles (NPs) and graphene oxide 
(GO), we develop a pH-responsive FePt-based multifunctional theranostic agent for
potential in vivo and in vitro dual modal MRI/CT imaging and in situ cancer
inhibition. The fcc-FePt will release highly active Fe ions due to the low pH in 
tumor cells, which would catalyze H2O2 decomposition into reactive oxygen species
(ROS) within the cells and further induce cancer cell apoptosis. Conjugated with 
folic acid (FA), the iron platinum-dimercaptosuccinnic acid/PEGylated graphene
oxide-folic acid (FePt-DMSA/GO-PEG-FA) composite nanoassemblies (FePt/GO CNs)
could effectively target and show significant toxicity to FA receptor-positive
tumor cells, but no obvious toxicity to FA receptor-negative normal cells, which 
was evaluated by WST-1 assay. The FePt-based multifunctional nanoparticles allow 
real-time monitoring of Fe release by T2-weighted MRI, and the selective contrast
enhancement in CT could be estimated in vivo after injection. The results showed 
that FePt-based NPs displayed excellent biocompatibility and favorable MRI/CT
imaging ability in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, the decomposition of FePt will
dramatically decrease the T2-weighted MRI signal and increase the ROS signal,
which enables real-time and in situ visualized monitoring of Fe release in tumor 
cells. In addition, the self-sacrificial decomposition of fcc-FePt will be
propitious to the self-clearance of the as-prepared FePt-based nanocomposite in
vivo. Therefore, the FePt/GO CNs could serve as a potential multifunctional

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the predictive value of renal sonography for
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and the efficacy of renal sonography, technetium Tc
99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning, and a combination of the two
for VUR screening in children younger than 2 years with a first episode of
febrile urinary tract infection.
METHODS: Thirty-eight patients younger than 2 years with a first febrile urinary 
tract infection were included in our study, which was conducted from April
through October 2014. Each kidney was considered a separate renal unit. A
retrospective review of clinical information and images (renal sonography, DMSA
scanning, and voiding cystourethrography) was performed.
RESULTS: Of the 14 renal units (18.4%) with VUR, 4 (28.5%) had high-grade VUR.
Among single findings, dilatation of the renal collecting system, wall thickening
of the renal collecting system, and DMSA scans significantly predicted VUR (P=
.038, .027, and .01, respectively). Dilatation was the most common single finding
(46 of 76 renal units). The sensitivity values for dilatation, wall thickening,
and DMSA scans were 85.7%, 64.2%, and 50.0%, and the negative predictive values
were 93.3%, 89.7%, and 87.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: The negative predictive values indicate that normal renal
sonographic and DMSA findings can predict the absence of high-grade VUR. We
propose that renal sonographic findings of wall thickening as well as dilatation 
of the renal collecting system should be considered predictive of high-grade VUR.

CONTEXT: The effect of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and maleic acid (MA) when
used alone on smear layer has been evaluated with mixed results, but their effect
when combined with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) has not been studied.
AIM: To compare the effectiveness of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, MA, and
DMSA against the combination of these with NaOCl in the removal of smear layer.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: n = 4pq/L(2) q = 1 - p p = Incident rate L = Allowable
error.
METHODS: One hundred and forty extracted, anterior teeth were
radiovisiographically assessed. Access preparation was done; apical patency was
established. Cleaning and shaping was accomplished using step-back technique. The
specimens were randomly allocated as per the final irrigation protocol. After
final irrigation, teeth were prepared for scanning electron microscope analysis, 
and the middle and apical thirds of radicular dentin were evaluated at ×1000 for 
evaluation of severity of occlusion of dentinal tubules with smear layer.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The data were statistically analyzed using the Student's
t-test and kappa test.
RESULTS: For combined irrigation, 10% DMSA + NaOCl was significantly better than 
all other groups both in the middle third and the apical third. It was more
effective in the middle third than at apical third.
CONCLUSION: Ten percent DMSA in combination with NaOCl removes the smear layer
more effectively at both the middle and apical third.

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is used in nuclear medicine as ligand for
preparation of diagnostic and therapy radiopharmaceuticals. DMSA has been the
subject of numerous investigations during the past three decades and new and
significant information of the chemistry and pharmacology of DMSA complexes have 
emerged. In comparison to other ligands, the structure of some DMSA complexes is 
unclear up today. The structures and applications of DMSA complexes are strictly 
dependent on the chemical conditions of their preparation, especially pH and
components ratio. A computational study of M-DMSA (M=Tc, Re) complexes has been
performed using density functional theory. Different isomers for M(V) and M(III) 
complexes were studied. The pH influence over ligand structures was taken into
account and the solvent effect was evaluated using an implicit solvation model.
The fully optimized complex syn-endo Re((V))-DMSA shows a geometry similar to the
X-ray data and was used to validate the methodology. Moreover, new alternative
structures for the renal agent (99m)Tc((III))-DMSA were proposed and
computationally studied. For two complex structures, a larger stability respect
to that proposed in the literature was obtained. Furthermore, Tc((V))-DMSA
complexes are more stable than Tc((III))-DMSA proposed structures. In general, Re
complexes are more stable than the corresponding Tc ones.

CONTEXT: Kinetic models could assist clinicians potentially in managing cases of 
lead poisoning. Several models exist that can simulate lead kinetics but none of 
them can predict the effect of chelation in lead poisoning. Our aim was to devise
a model to predict the effect of succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid; DMSA)
chelation therapy on blood lead concentrations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We integrated a two-compartment kinetic succimer model
into an existing PBPK lead model and produced a Chelation Lead Therapy (CLT)
model. The accuracy of the model's predictions was assessed by simulating
clinical observations in patients poisoned by lead and treated with succimer. The
CLT model calculates blood lead concentrations as the sum of the background
exposure and the acute or chronic lead poisoning. The latter was due either to
ingestion of traditional remedies or occupational exposure to lead-polluted
ambient air. The exposure duration was known. The blood lead concentrations
predicted by the CLT model were compared to the measured blood lead
concentrations.
RESULTS: Pre-chelation blood lead concentrations ranged between 99 and 150 μg/dL.
The model was able to simulate accurately the blood lead concentrations during
and after succimer treatment. The pattern of urine lead excretion was
successfully predicted in some patients, while poorly predicted in others.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model is able to predict blood lead concentrations after
succimer therapy, at least, in situations where the duration of lead exposure is 
known.

Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MNPs) have been extensively utilized in a wide
range of biomedical applications including magnetic hyperthermia agent. To
improve the efficiency of the MNPs in therapeutic applications, in this study, we
have synthesized CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and its surface was further functionalized
with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The anticancer agent, Doxorubucin
(DOX) was conjugated with CoFe2O4@DMSA nanoparticle to evaluate the combined
effects of thermotherapy and chemotherapy. The drug delivery efficiency of the
DOX loaded CoFe2O4@DMSA nanoparticles were examined based on magnetically
triggered delivery of DOX into the subcellular level of cancer cells by using
MDA-MB-231 cell line. The amine part of the DOX molecules were effectively
attached through an electrostatic interactions and/or hydrogen bonding
interactions with the carboxylic acid groups of the DMSA functionalities present 
onto the surface of the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. The DOX loaded CoFe2O4@DMSA
nanoparticles can effectively uptake with cancer cells via typical endocytosis
process. After endocytosis, DOX release from CoFe2O4 nanoparticles was triggered 
by intracellular endosomal/lysosomal acidic environments and the localized heat
can be generated under an alternating magnetic field (AMF). In the presence of
AMF, the released DOX molecules were accumulated with high concentrations into
the subcellular level at a desired sites and exhibited a synergistic effect of an
enhanced cell cytotoxicity by the combined effects of thermal-chemotherapy.
Importantly, pH- and thermal-responsive Dox-loaded CoFe2O4 nanoparticles induced 
significant cellular apoptosis more efficiently mediated by active mitochondrial 
membrane and ROS generation than the free Dox. Thus, the Dox-loaded CoFe2O4@DMSA 
nanoparticles can be used as a potential therapeutic agent in cancer therapy by
combining the thermo-chemotherapy techniques.

Alexandria, Egypt.

OBJECTIVE: To report our multicentre experience and outcomes with laparoscopic
transperitoneal and retroperitoneal upper pole heminephroureterectomy (HNU) in
children with renal duplex systems and impaired upper pole.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Laparoscopic HNU was performed in 22 children (15 girls,
seven boys) with a mean age of 5.9 years. A retroperitoneal approach was used in 
17 patients and a transperitoneal approach in the remaining five, between 2005
and 2010. Urinary tract infection was the initial presenting symptom in all
children except for one with urinary retention caused by a large ureterocele.
Voiding cystourethrography and renal scintigraphy revealed dual collecting
systems on the right side in 11 and on the left in 11 cases. The upper pole
collecting system was non-functioning in all cases. Postoperative ultrasonography
was done at 1 and 3 months, with renal scintigraphy at 3 months, to check the
remaining function of the lower moiety.
RESULTS: Overall, the mean operation time was 152 min (144 min for
retroperitoneal and 160 min for transperitoneal). Blood loss was 10-50 mL and
there were no intraoperative complications. The mean (SD) hospitalisation and
postoperative follow-up were 3.5 (1.25) days and 22 (9.83) months, respectively. 
Postoperative recovery was uneventful and at the 3-month follow-up renal
scintigraphy revealed no parenchymal loss of the remaining renal moiety.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic HNU in children can be performed via transperitoneal or 
retroperitoneal approach, both with low morbidity and with the typical benefits
of laparoscopic surgery.

INTRODUCTION: Paediatric Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the commonly
encountered entities by paediatricians. Studies have shown easy vulnerability of 
paediatric urinary tract in any acute febrile illness and a miss in diagnosis
could have long term consequences like renal scaring with its adverse effects.
Bearing these evidence based preludes in view we designed our study to know the
prevalence of UTI in Kashmir province.
AIM: Aim of the present study was to know the prevalence of UTI in febrile
children and to know the sensitivity of different imaging modalities like Renal
and Urinary Bladder Ultrasonography (RUS), Voiding Cystourethrography (VCUG) and 
Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (DMSA) scan in diagnosing UTI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 304 patients, between 2 months to 10 years,
with axillary temperature of ≥ 100.4(o)F (38(o)C), who did not have a definite
source for their fever and who were not on antibiotics were included in the
study. Detailed history and through clinical examination was done to rule out any
potential or definite focus of infection as per the predesigned proforma. Routine
urine examination with culture and sensitivity, followed by RUS and VCUG was done
in all patients where routine urine examination was suggestive of UTI. DMSA was
done in only culture proven cases after 6 months to document the renal scarring.
RESULTS: Out of 304 children, 140 were males and 164 were females, UTI was
present in 40 patients who had fever without any apparent cause giving a
prevalence of 13.2%. Escherichia coli (E. coli) were the commonest isolated
organism, followed by Klebsiella and Citrobacter species. Renal and Urinary
Bladder Ultrasonography (RUS) detected Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) in 25% (10/40)
while VCUG showed VUR in 55% (22/40) giving a RUS sensitivity of 45% for
detecting VUR. DMSA done only after 6 months in UTI diagnosed patients showed a
renal scarring in 25% (10/40) patients.
CONCLUSION: Missing a febrile paediatric UTI, can prove a future catastrophe if
not timely diagnosed and treated.

Although iron oxide nanoparticles (IRONs) were applied in clinical magnetic
resonance imaging in vivo and magnetic tissue engineering in vitro widely, the
underlying effects of IRONs on the development of cardiomyocytes especially the
intercellular junctions, intercalated discs (IDs), remain an unknown issue. Given
the critical role of three-dimensional (3D) engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) in 
evaluation of nanoparticles toxicology, it remained necessary to understand the
effects of IRONs on IDs assembly of cardiomyocytes in 3D environment. In this
study, we first reconstituted collagen/Matrigel based ECTs in vitro and prepared 
IRONs with 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA-IRONs). We found that the
internalization of DMSA-IRONs by cardiac cells in dose-dependent manner was not
associated with the cell distribution in 3D environment by determination of
Prussian blue staining and transmission electronic microscopy. Significantly,
through determination of western blotting and immunofluorescence of connexin 43, 
N-cadherin, desmoplakin, and plakoglobin, DMSA-IRONs enhanced the assembly of gap
junctions, decreased mechanical junctions (adherens junctions and desmosomes) of 
cardiac cells but not in dose-dependent manner in ECTs at seventh day. In
addition, DMSA-IRONs increased the vesicles secretion of cardiac cells in ECTs
apparently compared to control groups. Overall, we conclude that the
internalization of DMSA-IRONs by cardiac cells in dose-dependent manner enhanced 
the assembly of electrochemical junctions and decreased the mechanical related
microstructures. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl

Introduction. Chronic poisoning may result in home setting after mercury (Hg)
vapours inhalation from damaged devices. We report a chronic, nonoccupational Hg 
poisoning due to 10-year indoor exposure to mercury spillage. Case Report. A
72-year-old man with polyneuropathy of suspected toxic origin. At
hospitalization, toxicological clinical evaluations confirmed the altered
neurological picture documented across the last decade. Periodic blood and urine 
Hg levels (BHg, UHg) monitoring were performed from admission (t0), until 1 year 
later (t2), paralleled by blood neurochemical markers assessment, that is,
lymphocytes muscarinic receptors (l-MRs). At t0: BHg and UHg were 27 and
1.4 microg/L, respectively (normal values: BHg 1-4.5; UHg 0.1-4.5), associated
with l-MRs increase, 185.82 femtomoL/million lymphocytes (normal range:
8.0-16.0). At t1 (two days after DMSA-mobilization test), BHg weak reduction,
paralleled by UHg 3.7-fold increase, was measured together with further l-MRs
enhancement (205.43 femtomoL/million lymphocytes). At t2 (eight months after two 
cycles of DMSA chelating therapy ending), gradual improving of clinical
manifestations was accompanied by progressive decrease of BHg and UHg (4.0 and
2.8 microg/L, resp.) and peripheral l-MRs neurochemical marker (24.89
femtomoL/million lymphocytes). Conclusion. l-MRs modulatory effect supports their
use as peripheral neurochemical marker in Hg poisoning diagnosis and chelation
therapy monitoring.

INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infection (UTI) occurs in 1.1% of girls and 1.4% of
boys during the first year of life. Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) is usually
detected incidentally in 0.9% of girls and 2.5% of boys at this age. The aim of
the study was to assess the usefulness of measurement of pro-inflammatory urine
interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 concentrations and anti-inflammatory transforming
growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) level in infants with febrile UTI, non-febrile UTI and 
ABU.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 35 children, mean age 6.14 ±3.47 months, were
divided into three groups: group I - febrile UTI (n = 13), group II - non-febrile
UTI (n = 13) and group III - ABU (n = 9). At the time of enrollment urine IL-6,
IL-8, TGF-β1 and serum C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR), and white blood cell count (WBC) were measured. Renal ultrasound was
performed in all children, (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA)
and voiding cystourethrography in children with UTI.
RESULTS: Urine concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly higher in
febrile UTI compared to those with non-febrile UTI and ABU (p < 0.5, p < 0.01)
and positively correlated with CRP, ESR and WBC (p < 0.01). Urine levels of
TGF-β1 were significantly higher in children with febrile UTI compared to those
with ABU (p < 0.05) and positively correlated with WBC (p < 0.01). Inflammatory
changes in the DMSA scan were detected in 66.6% of children with UTI. No
significant difference in frequency of an abnormal DMSA scan compared to a normal
scan was found in groups with febrile and non-febrile UTI. No relations between
urine cytokines, systemic inflammatory markers and changes in DMSA scan were
observed. The cutoff value for detection of inflammatory changes in the DMSA scan
for IL-8 was 120 pg/mg creatinine (Cr) and 40 pg/mg Cr for TGF-β1. Based on this 
value, the sensitivity for IL-8 was 58.3%, specificity 100% and for TGF-β1 66.7% 
and 83.7%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We found significant differences in children with febrile UTI and
ABU regarding urine IL-6, IL-8 and TGF-β1 levels. Urine cytokines and systemic
inflammatory markers do not differentiate between upper and lower UTI in infants.

INTRODUCTION: In pediatric urology, partial nephrectomy is used primarily to
remove a non-functioning renal moiety in a duplicated system. There are few data 
on infants undergoing this procedure. As such, we present a robot-assisted
laparoscopic lower pole partial nephrectomy in an infant.
METHODS: Our patient was an 11-month-old (10.7 kg) male with a history of
prenatal hydronephrosis, who was diagnosed postnatally with a duplicated right
collecting system and severe hydroureteronephrosis of the right lower collecting 
system. A DMSA scan demonstrated no radiotracer uptake in the right lower pole. A
robot-assisted laparoscopic lower pole partial nephrectomy was performed.
RESULTS: A lower pole partial nephrectomy was accomplished. At 1 month
postoperatively, an ultrasound demonstrated no hydronephrosis or perinephric
fluid collection.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic partial nephrectomy is safe and feasible in pediatrics
including both older children and infants. It is successful for both upper and
lower pole partial nephrectomies.

Our aim is to determine the rational usage of imaging techniques in order to
prevent or minimize permanent renal damage in recurrent urinary tract infections 
(UTIs). This study was enrolled children aged between 2 and 36 months,
following-up with the diagnosis of recurrent UTI. All children had
ultrasonography (USG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid scanning, 39 of them had
underwent on voiding cystourethrography. There were 133 children (87 girls, 46
boys) with the mean age of 32.82 ± 38.10 months included into the study.
Forty-three kidney units were normal in ultrasonogram of which seven units had
reflux whereas among 35 units with hydronephrosis 22 units had reflux.
Sensitivity and specificity presence of hydronephrosis in ultrasonogram for
prediction of reflux was 75.9% and 73.5%, respectively. There were 19 dilated
ureters in ultrasonogram, and among them 14 had reflux. Sensitivity and
specificity of presence with ureteral dilatation in ultrasonogram for prediction 
of reflux was found as 48.3% and 89.8%, respectively. The sensitivity of
parenchymal thinning seen in ultrasonogram for the evaluation of renal parenchyma
was 15.9%, whereas specificity was 98.2% .Sensitivity and specificity of
dimercaptosuccinic acid for prediction of reflux was 51.6% and 72.3%,
respectively. The normal ultrasonogram findings cannot rule out neither
possibility of reflux presence nor development of renal scarring. Therefore, DMSA
scanning has major role both in determination of parenchymal damage and
prevention of scarring. Also we get an important result as ureteral dilatation
seen in USG, related to presence of reflux.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study was to investigate whether agmatine
(AGM) has a protective effect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two rats were randomly divided into four groups:
(1) Saline (control); (2) Cisplatin (CDDP; 7.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally); (3)
Agmatine (AGM; 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally); (4) Cisplatin plus agmatine
(CDDP + AGM). Agmatine was given before and two consecutive days after cisplatin 
injection. All the animals underwent renal scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA. The
levels of serum creatinine, cystatin C, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were
measured in addition to examination of the tissue samples with light microscopy. 
Acute renal injury was assessed with biochemical analyses, scintigraphic imaging,
and histopathological evaluation.
RESULTS: In the cisplatin group, the levels of BUN, creatinine, and cystatin C
were significantly higher than that of the controls. Histopathological
examination showed remarkable damage of tubular and glomerular structures.
Additionally, cisplatin caused markedly decreased renal 99mTc-DMSA uptake. AGM
administration improved renal functions. Serum creatinine, BUN, and cystatin C
levels had a tendency to normalize and, scintigraphic and histopathological
findings showed significantly less evidence of renal toxicity than those observed
in animals receiving cisplatin alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that AGM has a protective effect against
cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Therefore, it may improve the therapeutic index
of cisplatin. In addition, the early renal damage induced by cisplatin and
protective effects of AGM against cisplatin nephrotoxicity was accurately
demonstrated with 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy.

Environmental exposure to arsenic represents a serious challenge to humans and
other animals. The aim of the present study was to test the protective effect of 
antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) either individually or in combination with a
chelating agent, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), against sodium arsenite
oral toxicity in male rats. Five groups were used: control; arsenic group (orally
administrated in a concentration of 2 mg/kg body weight [b.w.]); the other three 
groups were orally administrated sodium arsenite in a concentration of 2 mg/kg
b.w. followed by either NAC (10 mg/kg b.w., intraperitoneally [i.p.]), DMSA (50
mg/kg b.w., i.p.) or NAC plus DMSA. Arsenic toxicity caused significant rise in
serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin,
and a significant decrease in total protein (TP) and albumin levels after 3 weeks
of experimental period. In addition, arsenic-treated rats showed significantly
higher arsenic content in liver and significant rise in hepatic malondialdehyde
level. By contrast, sharp decreases in glutathione content and catalase and
glutathione reductase activities were discernible. NAC and/or DMSA counteracted
most of these physiologic and biochemical defects. NAC monotherapy was more
effective than DMSA in increasing TP, while DMSA was more effective in decreasing
alanine aminotransferase. The combined treatment was superior over monotherapies 
in recovery of TP and glutathione. Biochemical data were well supported by
histopathological and ultrastructural findings. In conclusion, the combination
therapy of NAC and DMSA may be an ideal choice against oxidative insult induced
by arsenic poisoning.

We present a patient aged 54 years with early onset of dementia, epilepsy and
peripheral polyneuropathy. A mercury intoxication was diagnosed in 2010,
chelation therapy with 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate had failed. A source of 
exposure could not be identified. MRI showed unspecific hyperintense brain
lesions in 2015. She was referred for diagnosis and treatment. Neuropsychological
testing indicated severe memory loss and nerve conduction speed measurements
showed chronic neurogenically changed potentials. Mercury levels in blood and
urine and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were elevated. A detailed patient history
revealed a daily application of mercury-containing skin lightening creams for
6 years. Treatment with 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was started, blood
mercury levels were falling during treatment. She was discharged with DMSA
prescriptions. A renewed MRI revealed unchanged brain lesions. Blood and urine
mercury levels and NSE were falling. Memory function had improved qualitatively
and quantitatively.

INTRODUCTION: Exposure to metallic mercury can cause severe accidental
intoxications in children, whose clinical symptoms can vary depending on the
route of administration, the dose, as well as the time and duration of the
exposure. It has become unusual in France, yet it must be considered when taking 
a patient's medical history in cases of multisystemic involvement without a clear
explanation.
CLINICAL CASE: We report the case of a 12-year-old patient hospitalized because
of a cough, poor general condition, chills, night sweats, psychomotor
retardation, and skin lesions that had been developing for several weeks. The
initial clinical examination also revealed sinus tachycardia, arterial
hypertension, and abolition of osteotendinous reflexes. Complementary examination
results were normal apart from a glomerular proteinuria without renal failure.
When interviewing the mother, she reported that the child had played with mercury
balls 3 months earlier. The suspicion of poisoning was confirmed by blood and
urine analysis as well as renal biopsy showing an aspect of membranous
glomerulonephritis with IgG and C3 depositions. An intoxication via a transdermal
route being unlikely on healthy skin, the Regional Health Agency's survey
concluded that chronic intoxication had occurred by inhalation of the mercury
spread on the floor at the time of the exposure, which was then vacuum cleaned
and released again by the contaminated vacuum cleaner. The patient's outcome was 
favorable within a few weeks after initiating DMSA chelation therapy.
CONCLUSION: Mercury poisoning should be considered in cases of a multisystemic
disorder without clear explanation, in order to intervene quickly and thus
prevent irreversible renal and neurological consequences.

Rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque is the major pathological cause of
luminal thrombosis in acute coronary syndromes. Since foamy macrophages have been
identified as a prominent component in vulnerable atherosclerotic lesions and
osteopontin (OPN) is reported to be highly expressed in foamy macrophages, OPN
could be a potential target for vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque imaging. The
current study designed an OPN-specific MRI/optical dual-modality probe to detect 
vulnerable plaques. Fluorescence imaging revealed that 24 h after injection of
the Cy5.5-OPN-DMSA-MNPs (COD-MNPs), the atherosclerotic plaques in carotid artery
exhibited significant higher signals in high fat diet (HFD) fed mice in
comparison to the group injected with Cy5.5-IgG-DMSA-MNPs (CID-MNPs) or normal
diet fed group injected with COD-MNPs (1.87 ± 0.19 × 10(10) vs.
0.74 ± 0.04 × 10(10), 0.73 ± 0.03 × 10(10) p/sec/cm(2)/sr, P < 0.05). Meanwhile, 
MRI displayed stronger T2 contrast enhancement 24 h post-injection at the area of
atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid of HFD fed group injected with COD-MNPs
than group injected with CID-MNPs or normal diet fed group injected with COD-MNPs
(post/pre signal ratio: 0.64 ± 0.04 vs. 0.95 ± 0.02, 0.98 ± 0.01, P < 0.05). As a
dual-modality molecular probe, the resulting COD-MNPs conjugates exhibit
promising potentials for noninvasive detection of vulnerable atherosclerotic
plaque in vivo.

INTRODUCTION: Horseshoe kidney occurs in 1 per 400-800 live births and are more
frequently observed in males (M:F 2:1). Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO)
is commonly associated with horseshoe kidneys. The variable blood supply,
presence of the isthmus and high insertion of the ureter contribute to this
problem.
CASE REPORT: An asymptomatic 6 year-old boy presented with antenatal
hydronephrosis. Ultrasonography and CT scan demonstrated left UPJO associated
with a horseshoe kidney. DMSA showed 33% of function on the left side. DTPA
showed a flat curve and lack of washout. A left dismembered laparoscopic
pyeloplasty was performed after identification of crossing vessels and abnormal
implantation of the ureter. After one year, the child is asymptomatic. DTPA
demonstrated a good washout curve.
RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of six patients, five males and one female, with a 
mean age of 6 years (range 6m-17 years) and a mean follow-up of 3 years.
Ureteropelvic junction obstruction was more common on the left side. Symptoms
appeared only in 34% of the cases. Mean operative time was 198 minutes (range
120-270 minutes). Crossing vessels were common (observed in 50% patients). High
implantation of ureter was seen in 67% patients and intrinsic obstruction in 83%.
Surgical difficulties were found in two cases. Hospital stay was 4.3 days (3 to 6
days), with only one patient having a mild complication (pyelonephritis). All
cases had clinical and radiologic improvement.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic pyeloplasty is safe and feasible in children with UPJO
in horseshoe kidneys, with good results and minimal morbidity.

Objective:: To present the result of upgrading a clinical gamma-camera to be used
to obtain in vivo tomographic images of small animal organs, and its application 
to register cardiac, renal and neurological images.
Methods:: An updated version of the miniSPECT upgrading device was built, which
is composed of mechanical, electronic and software subsystems. The device was
attached to a Discovery VH (General Electric Healthcare) gamma-camera, which was 
retired from the clinical service and installed at the Centro de Imagem
Pré-Clínica of the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. The combined system was
characterized, determining operational parameters, such as spatial resolution,
magnification, maximum acceptable target size, number of projections, and
acquisition and reconstruction times.
Results:: Images were obtained with 0.5mm spatial resolution, with acquisition
and reconstruction times between 30 and 45 minutes, using iterative
reconstruction with 10 to 20 iterations and 4 projection subsets. The system was 
validated acquiring in vivo tomographic images of the heart, kidneys and brain of
normal animals (mice and adult rats), using the radiopharmaceuticals
technetium-labeled hexakis-2-methoxy-isobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-Sestamibi),
technetium-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) and technetium-labeled
hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO).
Conclusion:: This kind of application, which consists in the adaptation for an
alternative objective of already existing instrumentation, resulted in a low-cost
infrastructure option, allowing to carry out large scale in vivo studies with
enhanced quality in several areas, such as neurology, nephrology, cardiology,
among others.
Objetivo:: Apresentar o resultado da adaptação de uma gama câmara clínica para
uso dedicado na obtenção de imagens tomográficas in vivo de órgãos de pequenos
animais de experimentação, e de sua aplicação na obtenção de imagens cardíacas,
renais e neurológicas.
Métodos:: Foi construída uma versão atualizada do dispositivo de adaptação
miniSPECT, composto por três subsistemas: mecânico, eletrônico e de software. O
dispositivo foi montado em uma câmara Discovery VH da General Electric
Healthcare, retirada do serviço clínico e instalada no Centro de Imagem
Pré-Clínica do Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. O sistema combinado foi
caracterizado, determinando parâmetros de funcionamento como resolução espacial, 
magnificação, limites de tamanho dos alvos de estudo, número de projeções, tempo 
de registro e tempo de reconstrução das imagens tomográficas.
Resultados:: Foram obtidas imagens com resolução espacial de até 0,5mm, com
tempos de registro e reconstrução de 30 a 45 minutos, utilizando reconstrução
iterativa com 10 a 20 iterações e 4 subconjuntos de projeções. O sistema foi
validado obtendo imagens tomográficas in vivo do coração, dos rins e do cérebro
de animais normais (camundongos e ratos adultos), utilizando os radiofármacos
hexaquis-2-metoxi-isobutil-isonitrila marcado com 99mTc (Sestamibi-99mTc), ácido 
dimercaptosuccínico marcado com 99mTc (DMSA-99mTc) e
hexametil-propileno-amina-oxima marcada com 99mTc (HMPAO-99mTc).
Conclusão:: Este tipo de aplicação, que consiste na adaptação para um objetivo
alternativo de instrumentação já existente, constituiu-se em uma opção de
infraestrutura de baixo custo, que permite realizar estudos in vivo em larga
escala, com qualidade aprimorada, em áreas diversas, como neurologia, nefrologia,
cardiologia, entre outras.

AIM: This study evaluated the controversial relationship between the duration of 
fever before treatment initiation (FBT) for a febrile urinary tract infection
(UTI), with renal scarring based on dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA)
findings.
METHODS: The inpatient records of 148 children under two years of age with a
first episode of febrile UTI were analysed. Acute and repeat DMSA findings, and
clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated.
RESULTS: Acute DMSA showed that 76 of the 148 children with a febrile UTI had
renal lesions: 20 were mild, and 56 were moderate or severe. Repeat DMSA showed
renal scarring in 34 patients. The only factors associated with the development
of renal scars in the repeat DMSA were FBT of more than 72 hours, the presence
and severity of vesicoureteral reflux and increased procalcitonin levels and
absolute neutrophil counts. Multiple regression analysis showed that an FBT above
72 hours was the only significant factor that predicted renal scars.
CONCLUSION: Delay in treatment initiation of 72 hours or more was a risk factor
for permanent renal scars after the first episode of febrile UTI. Other
associated factors were increased procalcitonin and absolute neutrophil count on 
admission and the presence and severity of vesicouretal reflux.

CONTEXT: No kinetic models presently exist which simulate the effect of chelation
therapy on lead blood concentrations in lead poisoning.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop a kinetic model that describes the kinetics of 
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA; succimer), a commonly used chelating agent, that
could be used in developing a lead chelating model.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a kinetic modelling study. We used a
two-compartment model, with a non-systemic gastrointestinal compartment (gut
lumen) and the whole body as one systemic compartment. The only data available
from the literature were used to calibrate the unknown model parameters. The
calibrated model was then validated by comparing its predictions with measured
data from three different experimental human studies.
RESULTS: The model predicted total DMSA plasma and urine concentrations measured 
in three healthy volunteers after ingestion of DMSA 10 mg/kg. The model was then 
validated by using data from three other published studies; it predicted
concentrations within a factor of two, representing inter-human variability.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple kinetic model simulating the kinetics of DMSA in humans has
been developed and validated. The interest of this model lies in the future
potential to use it to predict blood lead concentrations in lead-poisoned
patients treated with DMSA.

OBJECTIVE: Different subtypes of Campylobacter spp. have been associated with
diarrhoea and a Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) method has been performed for
subtyping. In the present work, MLST was used to analyse the genetic diversity of
eight strains of Campylobacter coli.
METHODS: Nineteen genetic markers were amplified for MLST analysis: AnsB, DmsA,
ggt, Cj1585c, CJJ81176-1367/1371, Tlp7, cj1321-cj1326, fucP, cj0178, cj0755/cfrA,
ceuE, pldA, cstII, cstIII. After comparing the obtained sequences with the
Campylobacter MLST database, the allele numbers, sequence types (STs) and clonal 
complexes (CCs) were assigned.
RESULTS: The 8 C. coli isolates yielded 4 different STs belonging to 2 CCs. Seven
isolates belong to ST-828 clonal complex and only one isolate belong to ST-21.
Two samples came from the same patient, but were isolated in two different
periods of time.
CONCLUSIONS: MLST can be useful for taxonomic characterization of C. coli
isolates.

INTRODUCTION Due to limitation of colonoscopy in assessing the entire bowel and
patients' intolerance in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in the current study, 
we aimed to prospectively compare the accuracy of (99m)Tc(V)-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) and fecal calprotectin with ileocolonoscopy as new methods for
localizing inflammations. METHODS Current prospective study conducted between
2012 and 2014 on 30 patients with IBD attending Gastroenterology Clinic of Tehran
University of Medical Sciences. Fecal calprotectin and disease activity were
measured for all participants and all of them underwent (99m)Tc (V)-DMSA
scintigraphy and colonoscopy. The accuracy of (99m)Tc (V)-DMSA scintigraphy and
calprotectin in localizing bowel lesions were calculated. RESULTS A total of 22
patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 8 patients with Crohn's disease (CD)
were evaluated in our study. Sensitivity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and
positive predictive value (PPV) of scintigraphy and calprotectin over colonoscopy
in localization of UC lesions were 86.36%, 0.86%, 100.00% and 90.91%, 0.91, and
100.00%, respectively. Meanwhile, it showed 66.67% sensitivity and 81.25%
specificity with PLR=3.56, negative likelihood ratio (NLR)=0.41, PPV=84.21%, and 
negative predictive value (NPV)= 61.90% in localizing lesions in patients with
CD. The calprotectin level had sensitivity, PLR, and PPV of 90.00%, 0.90, and
100.00% in detecting active disease over colonoscopy, respectively. CONCLUSION
The (99m)Tc (V)-DMSA scintigraphy would be an accurate method for detecting
active inflammation in follow-up of patients with IBD and assessing response to
treatment as a non-invasive and complementary method beside colonoscopy for more 
accurate diagnosis of CD or UC.

University of Medical sciences, Mashhad, Iran.

Crossed renal ectopia is a rare urinary system anomaly which mostly is
asymptomatic and is diagnosed incidentally. Urinary obstruction, infection, and
neoplasia of the urinary system and nephrolithiasis are main complications of
this anomaly. A 6-year-old boy admitted to the hospital with colicky abdominal
pain and nausea. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in right lower
quadrant. Urine analysis and culture were normal. Kidney ultrasonography showed
right kidney in pelvis cavity with no kidney tissue in left side. TC 99-DMSA scan
demonstrated no radiotracer accumulation in the normal renal area. Radiotracer
accumulation was seen in the pelvis area with a deviation to the left. Voiding
cystoureterogram revealed right sided grade II vesicoureteral reflux. Severe
urological anomalies in children may be asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms
such as abdominal pain.

INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial
infections in children that can be associated with renal parenchymal injuries and
late scars. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan is known as golden standard
for detecting acute pyelonephritis (APN) that has a lot of difficulties and
limitations.
OBJECTIVES: we designed this study the accuracy of one inflammatory marker, serum
procalcitonin (PCT) to identify as an early predictor of renal injuries.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in 95 patients who
admitted in the hospital with the first febrile UTI. Serum PCT of all patients
was measured; sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value
(PPV and NPV) of this marker was analyzed compared to DMSA scan. P value <0.05
was taken as significant.
RESULTS: In total, 79 females and 16 males were investigated. There are 42 cases 
in group 1 with normal DMSA scan and 53 patients in group two with renal
parenchymal injuries in their scans. Mann-Whitney test showed a meaningful
relation between the two groups regarding PCT level (P<0.0001). Sensitivity,
specificity, PPV and NPV of PCT reported in optimum cut off were 70%, 88.1%,
88.1% and 70%, respectively. The positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of PCT test was 
5.8.
CONCLUSION: In the current survey, PCT was the eligible inflammatory marker to
predict renal parenchymal injuries in children with proper sensitivity,
specificity, PPV and NPV that play also a pivotal role in the children aged less 
than 24 months, although, more studies should be undertaken to confirm.

School, Boston, MA.

OBJECTIVE: Split renal function (SRF) can be estimated with (99m)Tc-labeled
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) SPECT cortical renal scintigraphy on either 2D
projected images or 3D images. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
there is a significant difference between SRF values calculated with the 2D
method and those calculated with the 3D method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was performed with (99m)Tc-DMSA
SPECT images of 316 patients (age range, 1-26 years). All images were
reconstructed by filtered back projection. An automated computational method was 
developed to estimate SRF using both 2D projection images and direct 3D images. A
paired t test was used to evaluate the difference between SRFs determined with
the two methods and the association between the magnitude of the differences and 
kidney size, patient age, and SRF.
RESULTS: There was strong correlation between SRFs estimated with the 2D and 3D
methods (r = 0.94, p < 0.001). There was small significant difference (0.14% ±
0.86%, p = 0.003) in SRFs obtained with the two methods. The difference was
clinically negligible and independent of renal length (p = 0.698), volume (p =
0.297), and patient age (p = 0.768) but was associated with SRF (p = 0.018).
CONCLUSION: For determination of split renal function, (99m)Tc-DMSA SPECT renal
scintigraphy 2D coronal projection images perform as well as and are simpler to
analyze than 3D images.

Molybdoenzymes are an ancient protein family found in phylogenetically and
ecologically diverse prokaryotes. Under anaerobic conditions, respiratory
molybdoenzymes catalyze redox reactions that transfer electrons to a variety of
substrates that act as terminal electron acceptors for energy generation. Here,
we used probe sequences to conduct an extensive genomic survey and phylogenetic
inference for NarG, DmsA, TorA and nine other respiratory molybdoenzyme
subfamilies. Our analysis demonstrates their abundance in 60% of prokaryotic
phyla. In contrast to many other autonomic genetic units in prokaryotes, the
major route of evolution of their predominant subfamilies is vertical gene
transfer, gene duplication and divergence. Our results show the robustness of
genomic co-occurrence of respiratory molybdoenzymes genes, found in the majority 
of studied species, for most of the enzyme subfamilies. Genomes which encode for 
multiple respiratory molybdoenzymes are also enriched in genes regulating
replication, recombination and mobility of genetic elements. Respiratory
molybdoenzymes were found in prokaryotes associated with diverse environments
occupying terrestrial, aquatic, food and host-related habitats, emphasizing their
essential role in adaptation of prokaryotes to changing environments.
Interestingly, host-associated prokaryotes such as human pathogens more
frequently carry multiple respiratory molybdoenzyme genes compared with
non-host-associated prokaryotes, highlighting the importance of metabolic
flexibility in host-microbiome environments.

[Management of blunt renal trauma in paediatric patients].

[Article in Dutch]

- In 90% of children, blunt abdominal trauma is the cause of renal, splenic or
hepatic injury or an injury affecting a combination of these organs.- Because
children's kidneys are anatomically less protected than those of adults,
potential renal injury following direct trauma affecting the child's flank, for
example by a handlebar or knee should be considered.- Symptoms of renal trauma
include excoriations or haematoma on the flank, a 'seatbelt-sign', macroscopic
haematuria and fractures of the ribs and vertebra.- As haematuria does not
correlate with the severity of renal injury, all children with persistent
haematuria should undergo renal imaging.- Children without abnormalities on
Doppler ultrasound examination and without macroscopic haematuria can be
discharged from the emergency room.- Conservative management of blunt renal
trauma is indicated for all haemodynamically stable children. However,
haemodynamically unstable children need to undergo an urgent laparotomy. The
routine use of bed rest is only indicated for grade V renal injuries.- A DMSA
scan is recommended 6-12 weeks after trauma for grade IV-V renal injury.

OBJECTIVES: The proposal and implementation of a computational framework for the 
quantification of structural renal damage from (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scans. The aim of this work is to propose, implement, and validate a
computational framework for the quantification of structural renal damage from
DMSA scans and in an observer-independent manner.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a set of 16 pediatric DMSA-positive scans and 16
matched controls and using both expert-guided and automatic approaches, a set of 
image-derived quantitative indicators was computed based on the relative size,
intensity and histogram distribution of the lesion. A correlation analysis was
conducted in order to investigate the association of these indicators with other 
clinical data of interest in this scenario, including C-reactive protein (CRP),
white cell count, vesicoureteral reflux, fever, relative perfusion, and the
presence of renal sequelae in a 6-month follow-up DMSA scan.
RESULTS: A fully automatic lesion detection and segmentation system was able to
successfully classify DMSA-positive from negative scans (AUC=0.92,
sensitivity=81% and specificity=94%). The image-computed relative size of the
lesion correlated with the presence of fever and CRP levels (p<0.05), and a
measurement derived from the distribution histogram of the lesion obtained
significant performance results in the detection of permanent renal damage
(AUC=0.86, sensitivity=100% and specificity=75%).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposal and implementation of a computational framework for the
quantification of structural renal damage from DMSA scans showed a promising
potential to complement visual diagnosis and non-imaging indicators.

A(1), Villavicencio H(1).

OBJECTIVES: Simple nephrectomy is performed for a benign pathology that does not 
require the excision of either the adrenal gland or any adenopathies. When it is 
carried out in cases of stone disease, however, it is frequently not a "simple"
technique owing to the presence of significant inflammation and infection.
METHODS: Ninety-six simple laparoscopic nephrectomies performed because of stone 
disease between 2006 and 2015 were retrospectively studied. A descriptive
statistical analysis was performed, as well as an evaluation of the associated
complications.
RESULTS: Of the 96 laparoscopic nephrectomies (62 left, 34 right), 7 (7.2%) had
to be converted into open surgery owing to the impossibility of dissecting the
renal hilum because of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (n = 4) or major
associated lesions (n = 3). The indication for nephrectomy was lumbar pain
associated with urinary infection, with a partial renal function below 15%
assessed by DMSA renal scan. There were three major complications. Pathologic
assessment revealed chronic pyelonephritis with kidney atrophy and associated
pyonephrosis in 85 cases, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis in 10, and pT4
squamous cell carcinoma in 1.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its high technical difficulty, simple laparoscopic
nephrectomy for stones is a viable technique for advanced laparoscopists. Its
principal advantage compared with open surgery is improved postsurgical recovery,
and it is associated with an acceptable complication rate. Xanthogranulomatous
pyelonephritis is not an initial contraindication to laparoscopy, but it is the
most significant risk factor for conversion to open surgery.

Surface Modified Iron Oxide Nanoparticles as Fe Source Precursor to Induce the
Formation of Prussian Blue Nanocubes.

Hu S, Zhang X, Zang F, Zhang Y, Zhang W, Wu Y, Song M, Wang Y, Gu N.

Nano-sized Prussian blue (PB) cubes were synthesized at room temperature by
simply stirring the mixture of surface modified iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) 
and potassium ferrocyanide in an aqueous acid solution. The nanocubes were
characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The influence of different
molecules modified on the surface of IONPs on the cube formation was discussed.
The surface modification with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) and citric acid (CA) all displayed a key role
in the formation precess of PB nanocubes, but which could not be formed as bare
IONPs or Fe3+ were used as precursor. Combined with the reaction process tracing 
with UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and TEM, a possible kinetically controlled
growth mechanism was proposed where slower formation rate of amorphous PB due to 
very low release rate of Fe ions from the surface modified IONPs and subsequent
recrystallization are responsible for the obtained PB nanocubes. The
peroxidase-like catalytic activity of the synthesized nanocubes was investigated 
and catalysis was found to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The potential of
using such PB nanocubes as an effective MRI contrast agent was also demonstrated.

BACKGROUND: Nanoparticles' unique features have been highly explored in cellular 
therapies. However, nanoparticles can be cytotoxic. The cytotoxicity can be
overcome by coating the nanoparticles with an appropriated surface modification. 
Nanoparticle coating influences biocompatibility between nanoparticles and cells 
and may affect some cell properties. Here, we evaluated the biocompatibility of
gold and maghemite nanoparticles functionalized with 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA), Au-DMSA and γ-Fe2O3-DMSA respectively, with human mesenchymal stem cells.
Also, we tested these nanoparticles as tracers for mesenchymal stem cells in vivo
tracking by computed tomography and as agents for mesenchymal stem cells magnetic
targeting.
RESULTS: Significant cell death was not observed in MTT, Trypan Blue and light
microscopy analyses. However, ultra-structural alterations as swollen and
degenerated mitochondria, high amounts of myelin figures and structures similar
to apoptotic bodies were detected in some mesenchymal stem cells. Au-DMSA and
γ-Fe2O3-DMSA labeling did not affect mesenchymal stem cells adipogenesis and
osteogenesis differentiation, proliferation rates or lymphocyte suppression
capability. The uptake measurements indicated that both inorganic nanoparticles
were well uptaken by mesenchymal stem cells. However, Au-DMSA could not be
detected in microtomograph after being incorporated by mesenchymal stem cells.
γ-Fe2O3-DMSA labeled cells were magnetically responsive in vitro and after
infused in vivo in an experimental model of lung silicosis.
CONCLUSION: In terms of biocompatibility, the use of γ-Fe2O3-DMSA and Au-DMSA as 
tracers for mesenchymal stem cells was assured. However, Au-DMSA shown to be not 
suitable for visualization and tracking of these cells in vivo by standard
computed microtomography. Otherwise, γ-Fe2O3-DMSA shows to be a promising agent
for mesenchymal stem cells magnetic targeting.

99mTc-DMSA scan is the best investigation to assess renal scarring after urinary 
tract infection (UTI) in children. The aim of this study was to describe the
findings of DMSA scans done six months after the first UTI. A descriptive
cross-sectional study was done among 110 boys and 80 girls selected by systematic
sampling. Urine culture was positive in 164 (86.3%) children. There was no
statistically significant association between the DMSA scan result and gender,
family history of UTI (p=1.00), family history of vesico-ureteric reflux
(p=1.00), febrile UTI (p=0.134) and positive urine culture (p=1.00).In 93.7% of
children DMSA scan was negative. Hence routinely recommending DMSA scans
following UTI must be reconsidered.

BACKGROUND: Retroperitoneoscopic upper pole heminephrectomy (RUHN) in duplex
kidney in children remains a challenging procedure with a need for postoperative 
functional assessment of the remnant lower pole. We aimed to calculate the
incidence of long-term functional renal outcomes in these children and examine
the effect of age on those outcomes.
METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study of 9 years included all
patients undergoing RUHN and evaluated by renal ultrasound (US) and
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy pre and postoperatively. Patients
were divided in two age groups of ≤12 and >12 months. Standard follow-up assessed
pre-, intra- and postoperative outcomes using clinical review, US and DMSA.
RESULTS: Standard RUHN in lateral position was performed in 30 patients. Five
cases were excluded (2 lacks of postoperative DMSA, 3 conversions). Indications
for RUHN were non-functioning upper moieties (n = 25) caused by ureterocele
(n = 11), ectopic distal implantation of the ureter with incontinence (n = 6) or 
evolving severe ureterohydronephrosis (n = 8). Mean age at surgery was
30 ± 27 months, operation time 116 ± 52 min and hospital stay 2.8 ± 1 days.
Long-term follow-up (mean, 7.2 ± 2.7 years) with US and DMSA showed that none of 
the 25 patients had complete loss of lower pole renal function. Mean lower pole
renal function directly related to RUHN was not significantly different after
versus before RUHN for the entire cohort (n = 24; 39.7 ± 7.90 % vs.
41.7 ± 6.74 %; p = 0350), for the ≤12-month (n = 6; 39.3 ± 4.18 vs. 41.3 ± 5.47; 
p = 0.493) and the >12-month groups (n = 18; 39.8 ± 8.90 vs. 41.9 ± 7.25;
p = 0.443). Four patients (17 %) had partial loss of function (mean function
loss, 9.3 ± 5.85 %; median age, 13 months). The number and type of complications 
between the two age groups were not statistically different. Overall, 29 %
(n = 7/24) of the patients presented with medium-term (17 %) and long-term (17 %)
complications directly related to RUHN.
CONCLUSIONS: RUHN is a demanding yet efficient technique that is safe for the
lower pole at any age. Systematic postoperative DMSA is not mandatory as long as 
US remains normal.

Candida albicans is one of the most frequently isolated fungal pathogens causing 
opportunistic infections in humans. Targeted magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) is
a promising method in thermal therapy facilitating selective heating of pathogen 
cells like C. albicans. In the paper, we used meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and functionalised anti-C. albicans
immunomagnetic nanoparticles (IMNPs) to investigate the potential of MFH in
combating C. albicans cells in vitro. Using Mössbauer spectroscopy it was found
that synthesised MNPs exhibited superparamagnetic phenomena. On the basis of
calorimetric experiments, the maximum SAR (specific absorption rate) was found
and a proper concentration of MNPs was established to control the temperature.
MFH based on both DMSA-coated MNPs and functionalised anti-C. albicans IMNPs was 
more effective in combating C. albicans cells in vitro than thermostat
hyperthermia. Especially promising results were obtained using functionalised
IMNPs, which eradicated most of the pathogen colonies at the temperature of
43 °C.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid scan or ultrasound in screening for vesicoureteral reflux
among children with urinary tract infections.

Ave, Suite 301, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, 15213.

BACKGROUND: There is considerable interest in detecting vesicoureteral reflux
(VUR) because its presence, especially when severe, has been linked to an
increased risk of urinary tract infections and renal scarring. Voiding
cystourethrography (VCUG), also known as micturating cystourethrography, is the
gold standard for the diagnosis of VUR, and the grading of its severity. Because 
VCUG requires bladder catheterisation and exposes children to radiation, there
has been a growing interest in other screening strategies that could identify
at-risk children without the risks and discomfort associated with VCUG.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to evaluate the accuracy of two
alternative imaging tests - the dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan (DMSA) and
renal-bladder ultrasound (RBUS) - in diagnosing VUR and high-grade VUR (Grade
III-V VUR).
SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Register of
Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies from 1985 to 31 March 2016. The reference lists 
of relevant review articles were searched to identify additional studies not
found through the electronic search.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered published cross-sectional or cohort studies
that compared the results of the index tests (DMSA scan or RBUS) with the results
of radiographic VCUG in children less than 19 years of age with a
culture-confirmed urinary tract infection.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently applied the selection
criteria to all citations and independently abstracted data. We used the
bivariate model to calculate summary sensitivity and specificity values.
MAIN RESULTS: A total of 42 studies met our inclusion criteria. Twenty studies
reported data on the test performance of RBUS in detecting VUR; the summary
sensitivity and specificity estimates were 0.44 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.54) and 0.78
(95% CI 0.68 to 0.86), respectively. A total of 11 studies reported data on the
test performance of RBUS in detecting high-grade VUR; the summary sensitivity and
specificity estimates were 0.59 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.72) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.65 to
0.87), respectively. A total of 19 studies reported data on the test performance 
of DMSA in detecting VUR; the summary sensitivity and specificity estimates were 
0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.81) and 0.48 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.57), respectively. A total 
of 10 studies reported data on the accuracy of DMSA in detecting high-grade VUR. 
The summary sensitivity and specificity estimates were 0.93 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.98)
and 0.44 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.56), respectively.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Neither the renal ultrasound nor the DMSA scan is accurate 
enough to detect VUR (of all grades). Although a child with a negative DMSA test 
has an < 1% probability of having high-grade VUR, performing a screening DMSA
will result in a large number of children falsely labelled as being at risk for
high-grade VUR. Accordingly, the usefulness of the DMSA as a screening test for
high-grade VUR should be questioned.

BACKGROUND: Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans are often used in
the evaluation of pediatric patients with febrile urinary tract infections
(UTIs). Given the prevalence of febrile UTIs, we sought to quantify the cost,
radiation exposure, and clinical utility of DMSA scans when compared with
dedicated pediatric renal ultrasounds (RUSs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An institutional review board approved retrospective study
of children under the age of 18 years evaluated at our institution for febrile
UTIs between the years 2004-2013 was conducted. The patients had to meet all of
the following inclusion criteria: a diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux, a fever
>38°C, a positive urine culture, and evaluation with a DMSA scan and RUS. A chart
review was used to construct a cost analysis of technical and professional fees, 
radiographic results, and radiation dose equivalents.
RESULTS: Overall, 104 children met the inclusion criteria. A total of 122 RUS and
135 DMSA scans were performed. The technical costs of a DMSA scan incurred a 35% 
cost premium as compared to an RUS. The average effective radiation dose of a
single DMSA scan was 2.84 mSv. New radiographic findings were only identified on 
7% of those patients who underwent greater than 1 DMSA scan.
CONCLUSIONS: The utility of the unique information acquired from a DMSA scan as
compared to a RUS in the evaluation of febrile UTI must be evaluated on an
individual case-by-case basis given the increased direct costs and radiation
exposure to the patient.

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a precipitating factor in acute pyelonephritis
(APN), and a risk factor for renal scar formation, even if VUR and APN occur
independently. There is no scientific evidence on a specific diagnostic
evaluation of children after a febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). Based on
recent literature and our clinical experience, we reviewed the role of 99mTc
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in UTI/VUR imaging. We also reviewed
the DMSA challenges and controversies in UTI/VUR management. A DMSA renal scan is
the most reliable tool for the establishment of the diagnosis of APN during
febrile UTIs acute phase. The "top-down" approach focuses on kidney involvement
during UTI rather than on VUR existence, with a goal of diagnosing APN and/or
renal dysplasia. Therefore, DMSA is performed before void cysteourethrography
(VCUG). Late DMSA scanning should be performed to evaluate the presence of
permanent renal scars. DMSA may be considered valuable in the follow-up of
children with VUR, in order to detect new renal scarring after breakthrough or
recurrent UTIs. An abnormal DMSA scan comprises a risk factor for VUR
identification after UTI, for recurrent UTIs, renal damage/scarring, renal
function deterioration, and a negative predictive risk factor for VUR improvement
and/or spontaneous resolution. An individualized DMSA risk-based dynamic approach
may assist physicians on VUR management decisions. DMSA could play an important
role in selecting children with UTI/VUR who would benefit from close monitoring
and/or early intervention. However, more data are needed for evidence-based
guidelines.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the usefulness of procalcitonin (PCT) and other
analytical parameters (white blood cell count [WBC], C-reactive protein [CRP]) as
markers of acute renal damage in children after a first febrile or afebrile
urinary tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on children with a first episode of 
UTI admitted between January 2009 to December 2011, and in whom serum PCT, CRP
and white blood cell count were measured, as well as assessing the acute renal
damage with renal scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-DMSA (DMSA) within the first 72h
after referral. A descriptive study was performed and ROC curves were plotted,
with optimal cut-off points calculated for each parameter.
RESULTS: The 101 enrolled patients were divided into two groups according to DMSA
scintigraphy results, with 64 patients being classified with acute pyelonephritis
(APN), and 37 with UTI. The mean WBC, CRP and PCT values were significantly
higher in patients with APN with respect to normal acute DMSA. The area under the
ROC curve was 0.862 for PCR, 0.774 for WBC, and 0.731 for PCT. The optimum
statistical cut-off value for PCT was 0.285ng/ml (sensitivity 71.4% and
specificity 75%).
CONCLUSION: Although the mean levels of fever, WBC, CRP, and PCT were
significantly increased in patients with APN than in those who had UTI, the
sensitivity and specificity of these analytical parameters are unable to predict 
the existence of acute renal damage, making the contribution by renal DMSA
scintigraphy essential.

Hetero-nanoparticles represent an important family of composite nanomaterials
that in the past years are attracting ever-growing interest. Here, we report a
new strategy for the synthesis of water dispersible cobalt ferrite nanoparticles 
(CoxFe3-xO4 NPs) decorated with ultrasmall (2-3 nm) gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). 
The synthetic procedure is based on the use of 2,3-meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA), which plays a double role. First, it transfers cobalt ferrite NPs from
the organic phase to aqueous media. Second, the DMSA reductive power promotes the
in situ nucleation of gold NPs in proximity of the magnetic NP surface. Following
this procedure, we achieved a water dispersible nanosystem (CoxFe3-xO4-DMSA-Au
NPs) which combines the cobalt ferrite magnetic properties with the catalytic
features of ultrasmall Au NPs. We showed that CoxFe3-xO4-DMSA-Au NPs act as an
efficient nanocatalyst to reduce 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol and that they can
be magnetically recovered and recycled. It is noteworthy that such nanosystem is 
more catalytically active than Au NPs with equal size. Finally, a complete
structural and chemical characterization of the hetero-NPs is provided.

INTRODUCTION: The majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children are
treated in the ambulatory setting. The goal of this study is to describe the
course of outpatient UTI management, including health services utilization,
antibiotic switching (change from empirically prescribed antibiotic to another
antibiotic), and antibiotic side effects.
METHODS: Using a large claims database, Truven Health MarketScan Research
Database, we analyzed all children younger than 18 years old who had an
antibiotic prescribed for an outpatient UTI from 2002 to 2010. We evaluated
health services utilization and antibiotic switching in the 21-day period after
UTI diagnosis. We compared side effects with rates in patients receiving narrow
versus broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Chi-square analysis was used for
descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: We identified 242,819 outpatient, antibiotic-treated, UTI episodes.
During the 21-day period after presentation, 26% required more than one visit for
UTI management and <1% required hospital admission (Figure). Most children did
not have imaging within 21 days of UTI: renal bladder ultrasound in 6%, VCUG in
2.6%, and DMSA in 0.05%. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were empirically prescribed
to 34% of patients. Antibiotic switching occurred in only 8% of UTI episodes,
indicating that empiric prescription covered the offending uropathogen the
majority of the time. Antibiotic side effects occurred in 8% of UTI episodes. The
most common side effects were gastrointestinal (∼3% of UTI episodes). All other
side effects occurred in <1% of UTI episodes. Although there were statistically
significant differences in side effects between broad- and narrow-spectrum
antibiotics, these differences were not clinically relevant.
CONCLUSIONS: Most outpatient UTIs in children do not require more than one
healthcare visit, hospital admission, or change in empiric antibiotic therapy.
This study supports the fact that pediatric UTIs can be effectively treated in
the ambulatory setting.

In Vivo Magnetic Resonance and Fluorescence Dual-Modality Imaging of Tumor
Angiogenesis in Rats Using GEBP11 Peptide Targeted Magnetic Nanoparticles.

Angiogenesis is an essential process for tumor progression. Tumor
vasculature-targeting peptides have shown great potential for use in cancer
imaging and therapy. Our previous studies have shown that GEBP11, a novel
vasculature-specific binding peptide that exhibits high affinity and specificity 
to tumor angiogenesis, is a promising candidate for the diagnosis and targeted
radiotherapy of gastric cancer. In the present study, we developed a novel
magnetic resonance and fluorescence (MR/Fluo) dual-modality imaging probe by
covalently coupling 2,3-dimercaptosuccinnic acid-coated paramagnetic
nanoparticles (DMSA-MNPs) and Cy5.5 to the GEBP11 peptide. The probe
Cy5.5-GEBP11-DMSA-MNPs (CGD-MNPs), with a hydrodynamic diameter of 82.8 ± 6.5 nm,
exhibited good imaging properties, high stability and little cytotoxicity. In
vivo MR/Fluo imaging revealed that CGD-MNPs were successfully applied to
visualize tumor angiogenesis in SGC-7901 xenograft mouse models. Prussian blue
and CD31 immunohistochemical staining confirmed that CGD-MNPs co-localized with
tumor blood vessels. In conclusion, CGD-MNPs are promising candidates for use as 
MR and fluorescence imaging probes for visualizing gastric cancer angiogenesis in
vivo.

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of juxtaglomerular cell tumour of the kidney
(reninoma) in a child treated with laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery.
PATIENTS AND RESULTS: A 14-year-old girl was incidentally found to have
hypertension (180/114 mmHg) at the time of adenotonsillectomy. Pre-operative
investigations revealed a plasma renin level of 225.9 ng/dl (4.4-46), normal
aldosterone, cortisol and urinary catecholamine. Abdominal ultrasound detected a 
1.9 × 1.5-cm hypoechoic lesion in the right kidney lower pole; CT scan confirmed 
the presence of a 1.5-cm, circumscribed, solid, hypoenhancing cortical lesion in 
the right lower pole. Laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery was accomplished by
clamping the renal artery for 30 min; after excision, the tumour bed was closed
using barbed V-loc sutures. The procedure was completed laparoscopically in
150 min with no peri-operative complications. The patient was discharged home on 
day 4 postoperatively. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of a juxtaglomerular
cell tumour that was completely excised. The J-J stent was removed 1 month later.
At follow-up, the patient's blood pressure was normalized and medications were
stopped. A DMSA scan confirmed 36% residual right kidney function.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery should be considered in children
with juxtaglomerular tumours. This technique allows prompt recovery with
preservation of significant renal function.

BACKGROUND: No studies have examined whether use of sedation during a Tc-99 m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan reduces patient discomfort.
OBJECTIVE: To compare discomfort level during a DMSA scan to the discomfort level
during other frequently performed uroradiologic tests, and to determine whether
use of sedation during a DMSA scan modifies the level of discomfort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the discomfort level in 798 children enrolled 
in the Randomized Intervention for children with Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR)
and Careful Urinary Tract Infection Evaluation (CUTIE) studies by asking parents 
to rate their child's discomfort level with each procedure on a scale from 0 to
10. We compared discomfort during the DMSA scan and the DMSA image quality
between centers in which sedation was used >90% of the time (sedation centers),
centers in which sedation was used <10% of the time (non-sedation centers), and
centers in which sedation was used on a case-by-case basis (selective centers).
RESULTS: Mean discomfort level was highest for voiding cystourethrogram (6.4),
followed by DMSA (4.0), followed by ultrasound (2.4; P<0.0001). Mean discomfort
level during the DMSA scan was significantly higher at non-sedation centers than 
at selective centers (P<0.001). No difference was apparent in discomfort level
during the DMSA scan between sedation centers and selective centers (P=0.12), or 
between the sedation centers and non-sedation centers (P=0.80). There were no
differences in the proportion with uninterpretable DMSA scans according to
sedation use.
CONCLUSION: Selective use of sedation in children 12-36 months of age can reduce 
the discomfort level experienced during a DMSA scan.

were 18.8 and 326.7, respectively. These values at the concentration of 1 mg/L
were 17.2 and 291.6; at 10 mg/L, they were 19.6 and 334.4 ,and at 100 mg/L, they 
were 14.3 and 311.1. Results showed no significant differences between the tested
and the control groups at the level of p < 0.05. Exposure of embryos for 10 days 
showed absence of mortality, malformation, or hatching delay. X-ray
microtomography confirmed the presence of nanoparticles in exposed individuals
and showed the complete elimination of the nanoparticles after 30 days in clean
water. In the studied conditions, it is clear that γ-Fe2O3 coated with
stabilizing DMSA did not alter the fecundity or the fertility of the snail B.
glabrata after 4 weeks of exposure, and accumulation was not present after
30 days in clean water.

Renal DMSA uptake provides an index for evaluation of the functional tubular
mass, which depends on the renal blood flow, proximal tubular cell membrane
function, and urinary acid-base balance. We present a case of a nonazotemic
48-year-old adult with β-thalassemia major under regular blood transfusions and
iron chelation therapy that underwent DMSA scan showing minor cortical
abnormalities and high background activity, featuring prominent cardiac blood
pool and liver uptake. This case highlights the pitfall of high background
activity during DMSA study in patients with β-thalassemia major due to tubular
disorders.

BACKGROUND: Radionuclide techniques, as direct radionuclide cystography and
(99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy, have been used in evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux 
(VUR) and reflux nephropathy (RN) in children. Dynamic (99m)Tc-DTPA scintigraphy 
is reserved for evaluation of differential renal function and obstruction in
children, where hydronephrosis is detected by ultrasonography (US) pre- or
postnatally.
CASE REPORT: Six year old boy was prenatally diagnosed with bilateral
hydronephrosis. Postnatal, severe bilateral VUR was detected by voiding
urethrocytography. US and (99m)Tc-DTPA scintigraphy performed in the first month 
of life showed small left kidney that participated with 2% in the global renal
function. Bilateral cutaneous ureterostomy has been performed in order to obtain 
good renal drainage and promote optimal renal growth. Twelve months later,
classic antireflux procedure was done. Control (99m)Tc-DTPA scintigraphy, 5 ys
after antireflux surgery, revealed persisting radioactivity during the diuretic
phase, in the left kidney that indicated antireflux procedure failure with VUR
reappearance.
CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-DTPA scintigraphy is the first method of choice for long-term
monitoring of individual kidney function in children with VUR and other
congenital urinary tract anomalies. Additionally, it can be used as indirect
radionuclide cystography when rising of radioactivity in the kidney region,
during the diuretic phase can indicate presence of VUR.

INTRODUCTION: Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is one of the most common causes of
serious bacterial infection in infants. Renal scarring is the most prevalent
long-term complication.
OBJECTIVES: To review the incidence of renal scarring within 6 months after an
episode of APN in children under 36 months and its relationship with imaging
studies, clinical settings, and bacteriology.
METHOD: A retrospective study of previously healthy patients aged one to 36
months, admitted for a first episode of APN, with a minimum follow-up of 6
months. Demographic and clinical variables were collected along with
bacteriology, renal and bladder ultrasound scan, voiding cystourethrography,
DMSA-scintigraphy, and re-infection events.
RESULTS: A total of 125 patients were included in the study, of which 60% were
male, the large majority (92%) febrile, and due to E. coli (74.6%). There was a
history of prenatal ultrasound scan changes in 15.4%. Ultrasound scan found
dilation of the urinary tract in 22.1%. Voiding cystourethrography was performed 
on 70 patients: 54.3% no abnormalities, 12.8% vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) grade
i-iii, and 32.9% iv-v grade VUR. Six patients had iv-v grade VUR with a normal
ultrasound scan. Adherence to DMSA-scintigraphy at 6 months was only 61% of that 
indicated. Renal scarring was found in 44.3% of those in which it was performed
(60 cases).
CONCLUSIONS: Almost half (44%) DMSA-scintigraphy in children aged one to 36
months hospitalised for APN show renal scarring at 6 months, which was found to
be associated with the re-infection events and the iv-v grade VUR. There was no
relationship between scarring and the bacteriology or the elevations of
inflammatory biochemical markers.

PURPOSE: Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a serious bacterial infection that can
cause renal scarring in children. Early identification of APN is critical to
improve treatment outcomes. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a prognostic
marker of many diseases, but it has not yet been established in urinary tract
infection (UTI). The aim of this study was to determine whether NLR is a useful
marker to predict APN or vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 298 pediatric patients (age≤36 months) with
febrile UTI from January 2010 to December 2014. Conventional infection markers
(white blood cell [WBC] count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive
protein [CRP]), and NLR were measured.
RESULTS: WBC, CRP, ESR, and NLR were higher in APN than in lower UTI (P<0.001).
Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that NLR was a predictive factor for
positive dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) defects (P<0.001). The area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was high for NLR (P<0.001) as well 
as CRP (P<0.001) for prediction of DMSA defects. NLR showed the highest area
under the ROC curve for diagnosis of VUR (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: NLR can be used as a diagnostic marker of APN with DMSA defect,
showing better results than those of conventional markers for VUR prediction.

AIM: To assess of the role of renal ultrasonography (US) and DMSA renal
scintigraphy in the prediction of irreversible histological lesions of the upper 
pole in duplex system.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study based on data collected between 2005 and 2012
at our institution. The cohort consisted of 23 patients with ureteroceles and 28 
patients with ectopic ureters who underwent upper pole nephrectomy. Preoperative 
recordings from ultrasound and nuclear renal scans were compared with the
histological findings. Histological irreversible lesions were defined as the
presence of dysplasia and/or severe chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) in ≥ 90%
of the specimen. ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves were used to
investigate thresholds in order to identify irreversible lesions using various
differential functions. The histology was correlated with the results of imaging.
RESULTS: Pathological findings were found in all histological samples.
Histological lesions were irreversible in 20/23 patients (87.0%) with
ureteroceles and in 14/28 patients (50.0%) with ectopic ureters. The model is
able to predict irreversible lesions if an upper pole differential function is ≤ 
3% in patients with ureteroceles, and ≤ 2% in the presence of ectopic ureters.
Weak association between parenchymal thinning on ultrasonography and irreversible
lesions was found in patients with ectopic ureters.
CONCLUSION: DMSA renal scintigraphy provides a useful tool for the prediction of 
irreversible lesions in the upper pole. Low differential function (≤ 3% and ≤ 2%,
respectively) indicates irreversible lesions, favoring heminephrectomy. Higher
differential function indicates greater remaining biological potential of the
parenchyma, favoring reconstruction of the upper pole.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare planar
technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-DMSA) cortical scintigraphy with
Tc-DMSA single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the detection of
renal cortical scars in patients with chronic kidney disease stage-3 (CKD-3).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of 40 patients (mean age: 43.7±15.3 years, 29 men, 11 
women) who underwent planar Tc-DMSA along with regional Tc-DMSA SPECT for the
detection of renal cortical scars were prospectively evaluated. All the patients 
had CKD-3, with a mean serum creatinine level of 2.23±1.85 g/dl. Planar and SPECT
Tc-DMSA images were evaluated by two nuclear medicine readers independently. Each
kidney was divided into 12 cortical segments. A cortical segment was recorded as 
abnormal if it had reduced or absent radiotracer activity. The linear correlation
coefficient (r value) for the number of abnormal segments detected between
readers was calculated for planar imaging, SPECT, and between the two techniques 
for both the readers.
RESULTS: For both observers, the average correlation coefficient for SPECT
(r=0.87) and planar imaging (r=0.90) was high (P<0.0001). A moderately strong
linear correlation was also observed between readers for planar imaging and SPECT
(r=0.78 and 0.71, P<0.0001). There was no significant difference in the average
number of abnormal segments detected by planar versus SPECT imaging: 2.1 for
planar imaging and 2.8 for SPECT (P=0.06, two-tailed). In 15% of patients, SPECT 
detected cortical defects not appreciated on planar imaging.
CONCLUSION: Tc-DMSA renal cortical imaging using dual-head SPECT offers no
statistically significant diagnostic advantage over planar imaging for the
detection of cortical defects in patients with CKD-3.

A review of pitfalls and progress in chelation treatment of metal poisonings.

Most acute and chronic human metal poisonings are due to oral or inhalation
exposure. Almost 80% of published animal experiments on chelation in metal
poisoning used single or repeated intraperitoneal, intramuscular or intravenous
administration of metal and chelator, impeding extrapolation to clinical
settings. Intramuscular administration of dimercaptopropanol (BAL) has until now 
been used in acute arsenic, lead, and mercury poisonings, but repeated BAL
administration increased the brain uptake of As, Pb and Hg in experimental
animals. Also, diethyl dithiocarbamate (DDC) has been used as antidote in acute
experimental animal parenteral Cd poisoning, and both DDC and tetraethylthiuram
disulfide (TTD, disulfiram, Antabuse) have been used in nickel allergic patients.
However, even one dose of DDC given immediately after oral Cd or Ni increased
their brain uptake considerably. The calcium salt of ethylenediamminetetraacetic 
acid (CaEDTA) but not dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) increased the brain uptake
of Pb. In oral Cd or Hg poisoning, early oral administration of DMSA or
dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) increased survival and reduced intestinal
metal uptake. Oral administration of Prussian Blue or resins with fixed chelating
groups that are not absorbed offer chelation approaches for decorporation after
oral exposure to various metals. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)
nebulizers for pulmonary chelation after inhalation exposure need further
development. Also, combined chelation with more than one compound may offer
extensive advances. Solid knowledge on the chemistry of metal chelates together
with relevant animal experiments should guide development of chelation procedures
to alleviate and not aggravate the clinical status of poisoned patients.

The inhibitory effects of methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI), diethylene triamine
pentaacetic acid (DTPA), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and metilendifosfonat
(MDP) on human erythrocyte glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (hG6PD) activity
were investigated. For this purpose, hG6PD was initially purified 557-fold at a
yield of 51.43% using 2',5'-adenosine diphosphate (ADP) sepharose 4B affinity gel
chromatography. The in vitro effects of these chelators on hG6PD enzyme were
studied. IC50 values of MIBI, DTPA, DMSA and MDP were 0.056, 0.172, 0.274 and
0.175 mM, of hG6PD, respectively. It was detected in in vitro studies that the
hG6PD enzyme is inhibited due to these radiopharmaceutical chelators. In addition
to in vitro studies, in order to better understand the molecular mechanism of
studied compounds, combined in silico approaches, including molecular docking and
molecular dynamics (MD), simulations were successfully performed. MD simulations 
shed light on inhibition mechanisms of the individual inhibitors into the
ligand-binding pocket of hG6PD. Essential amino acids for binding are also
investigated using per-residue interaction analysis studies.

The aim of this work is to use Monte Carlo simulations and VOXEL phantoms to
estimate the absorbed dose in paediatric patients (aged from 2 weeks to 16 y),
with normal renal function, to whom technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc-DMSA) was administered, for diagnostic renal scintigraphy purposes; and
compare them with values obtained using the International Commission on
Radiological Protection (ICRP) methodology. In the ICRP methodology, the
cumulated absorbed dose in the kidneys is estimated by multiplying the
administered activity with the corresponding given dose coefficients. The other
methods were based on Monte Carlo simulations performed on two paediatric voxel
phantoms (CHILD and BABY), and another three phantoms, which were modified to
suit the mass of the patients' kidneys, and other anatomical factors. Different
S-values were estimated using this methodology, which together with solving the
ICRP biokinetic model to determine the cumulated activities, allowed for the
estimation of absorbed doses different from those obtained with the ICRP method, 
together with new dose coefficients. The obtained values were then compared. The 
deviations suggest that the S-values are strongly dependent on the patient's
total body weight, which could be in contrast with the ICRP data, which is
provided by age, regardless of other anatomical parameters.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to develop a method for estimating DMSA
SPECT renal function on each renal pole in order to evaluate the effect of
percutaneous nephrolithotripsy by focusing the measurements on the region through
which the percutaneous approach is performed.
METHODS: Twenty patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotripsy between
November 2010 and June 2012 were included in this study. Both Planar and
SPECT-DMSA studies were carried out before and after nephrolithotripsy. The
effect of percutaneous nephrolithotripsy was evaluated by estimating the total
renal function and the regional renal function of each renal pole. Despite PCNL
has been previously reported as a minimally invasive technique, our results
showed regional renal function decreases in the treated pole in most patients,
affecting the total renal function in a few of them.
RESULTS: A quantification method was used for estimating the SPECT DMSA renal
function of the upper, interpolar and lower renal poles. Our results confirmed
that total renal function was preserved after nephrolithotripsy. Nevertheless,
the proposed method showed that the regional renal function of the treated pole
decreased in most patients (15 of 20 patients), allowing us to find differences
in patients who had not shown changes in the total renal function obtained from
conventional quantification methods.
CONCLUSION: A method for estimating the SPECT DMSA renal function focused on the 
treated pole enabled us to show for the first time that nephrolithotripsy can
lead to a renal parenchymal damage restricted to the treated pole.

We sought to describe the practice of pediatric nuclear medicine at general
hospitals in the United States and to assess the impact of dose awareness
campaigns such as Image Gently.METHODS: A web-based survey was developed that
requested information regarding hospital type, whether the hospital practices
pediatric nuclear medicine, and the hospital's method for determining the
administered activity for children. The survey invitation was emailed to a sample
of general hospitals with more than 300 beds, excluding dedicated pediatric,
veterans, psychiatric, and rehabilitation hospitals. Data were collected for 5
procedures performed on children: (99m)Tc-methylene diphosphate (MDP) bone scans,
(99m)Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) renograms, (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) renal cortical scans, (99m)Tc-based hepatobiliary scans, and
(18)F-FDG PET scans. The sites reported dosage by weight (MBq/kg), minimum and
maximum dosages, and the activities that they would administer to 2 hypothetical 
patients: a 5-y-old boy (20 kg, 110 cm tall) and a 10-y-old girl (30 kg, 140 cm
tall).
RESULTS: The invitation was delivered to 196 sites, with 121 (61.7%) responding. 
Eighty-two hospitals (67.8%) performed nuclear medicine on children. All sites
scaled administered activity for children, mostly by body weight. Also, 82.4% of 
sites indicated they were familiar with Image Gently, 57.1% were familiar with
the 2010 North American consensus guidelines for children, and 54.9% altered
their protocols because of the guidelines. The median value for parameters
defined by the guidelines was equal to the guideline-recommended value for all
procedures. More than 50% of the sites-particularly those familiar with the
guidelines-were compliant with the guidelines regarding both the acquisition
parameters and the administered activities for the 2 hypothetical patients.
However, there remained a wide variation in practice, sometimes by more than a
factor of 10, for sites not familiar with the guidelines.
CONCLUSION: Image Gently and the North American guidelines have had a substantial
impact on pediatric nuclear medicine practice in the United States. However, a
wide variation in practice still exists, particularly for sites not familiar with
the guidelines. Further promotion and dissemination of the guidelines and best
practice are still necessary.

INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most prevalent
infections in children and infants. Early and accurate detection of renal
parenchymal involvement in UTI is necessary for decision making and determining
treatment strategies. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive
accuracy of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) for renal
parenchymal involvement in children with acute pyelonephritis.
METHODS: This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014 on
children who had been diagnosed with UTI. Children who were admitted to Koodakan 
Hospital in Bandar Abbas, Hormozgan Province, Iran, and whose ages ranged from
two months to 14 years were enrolled in the study. Urine samples were taken to
conduct urinary NGAL tests, urine cultures, and urinalyses. In addition, some
blood samples were collected for the purpose of determining leukocyte count and
C-reactive protein (CRP) and to conduct erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
tests. All patients underwent a dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. SPSS
software was used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: Among the participants in the study, 29 were male (32%), and 60 were
female (68%). The mean age of the children who participated in the study was 2.99
± 2.94 years. The results of the Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant
increase in the urinary NGAL level, an increase in the CRP level, and higher DMSA
scan grades (p < 0.001). The cutoff point amounted to > 5 mg/l, having the
negative predictive value (NPV) of 76.3%, the specificity of 97.83%, the positive
predictive value (PPV) of 96.7%, and the sensitivity of 67.4%.
CONCLUSION: Urinary NGAL is not sensitive enough for the prediction of renal
parenchymal involvement, but it is a specific marker.

This study was conducted to determine the relationship between overweight/obesity
and UTI in children. A comparison was made, in terms of overweight and obesity,
between 135 children with UTI (case group) and 135 healthy children (control
group). UTI was diagnosed through urine culture. Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal
scanning (DMSA) was also used to distinguish between lower UTI and acute
pyelonephritis. Overweight and obesity were determined based on standard body
mass index (BMI) curves. There were 12 (8.8%) overweight and 26 (19.2%) obese
children in the case group. Four (3.0%) overweight and five (3.7%) obese children
were found in the control group. There was a significant difference between the
two groups regarding overweight and obesity frequencies. However, no such
difference existed between children with cystitis and acute pyelonephritis. This 
study showed a significant relationship between overweight/obesity and UTI.
Therefore, overweight and obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of UTI in
children.

INTRODUCTION: The standard medical treatment for metal toxicity is chelation
therapy. Chelating agents work by forming less toxic complexes with the toxic
metal ions which are readily excreted from the body. These compounds, based on
their hydrophilic/lipophilic property, can either remove toxic metal ions from
extracellular sites or can penetrate the intracellular compartments to facilitate
the removal of toxic metal ions. However, there are various disadvantages
associated with this kind of therapy, notably, selectivity. Other problems and
challenges are that the therapy regime is expensive, time consuming and has poor 
patient compliance. Two chelating agents, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and
dimercaptopropionicsulfonate (DMPS) have gained increased acceptance among
clinicians, undoubtedly improving the management of metal intoxications.
AREAS COVERED: The present review provides an insight into the conventional
chelating agents, new chelators under development, and the new opportunities
presented by the use of nanotherapy for the treatment of metal poisoning cases.
EXPERT OPINION: Today's research should not only focus towards development of
alternate chelators but also targeted therapy such as the nanotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a multi-family group of proteins which
are upregulated by the cell in response to exposure to hazardous (stress)
factors, including infectious agents, to prevent changes in protein structure.
The aim of our study was to assess whether urine levels of the 70-kDa family of
HSPs (HSP70s) increase in children with urinary tract infection (UTI) and to
determine the optimal urine (u) HSP70 cut-off level to predict UTI in children.
METHODS: Forty patients with symptomatic UTI (UTI group), 30 healthy children
(control group), 21 asymptomatic patients with proven bacterial contamination in 
their urine culture (contamination group) and 30 patients with fever caused by
other infections (non-UTI infection group) were enrolled in the study. Random
urine samples were obtained for measurement of HSP70 and creatinine (Cr) from all
groups. Urine was collected prior to the treatment of UTI at the time of
presentation and after treatment. Urine HSP70 levels were measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent analysis. A dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was
performed at 5-7 days after presentation in UTI group to distinguish patients
with acute pyelonephritis from those with cystitis; based on this scan, no
patients had acute pyelonephritis. Patients were classified with pyelonephritis
in the presence of all of the following signs: axillary fever of ≥39 °C,
leukocytosis and positivity for C-reactive protein.
RESULTS: The mean urine HSP70:Cr ratio (uHSP70/Cr) prior to treatment was
significantly higher in the UTI group (449.86 ± 194.33 pg/mg) than in the
control, contamination and non-UTI infection groups (39.93 ± 47.61, 32.43 ± 9.09 
and 45.14 ± 19.76, respectively; p = 0.0001). Using a cut-off of 158 pg/mg
uHSP70/Cr for the prediction of UTI, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay
were 100 and 100 %, respectively (area under the time-concentration curve = 1).
The uHSP70/Cr was highest in the patients with clinical pyelonephritis
(p = 0.001). Mean uHSP70/Cr after treatment decreased to 60.68 ± 51.11 pg/mg in
UTI group (p = 0 .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that elevated uHSP70/Cr may be a useful
biomarker for the prediction of UTI in children, with a high sensitivity and
specificity, and that they may help to distinguish UTI from other infections as
well as bacterial contamination of the urine.

The process of reconstruction of pre-fabricated films comprising maghemite
nanoparticles deposited onto flat glass substrates triggered by immersion into
aqueous solutions of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) at increasing
concentration (0.025, 0.050, and 0.100 mol/L) is herein reported. The evolution
of this process was assessed by measuring the time (t) dependence of the particle
analysis histogram width (W) extracted from atomic force microscopy images.
Furthermore, a physical picture to model the film reconstruction which provides
reconstruction time constants associated to single particles (τ1) and small
agglomerates (τn), the key units associated to the process, ranging from τ1 = 2.9
and τn = 3.4 hour (0.025 mol/L) to τ1 = 5.1 and τn = 4.6 hour (0.100 mol/L) is
proposed. The nanoparticle-based film reconstruction triggered by an exogenous
stimulus, the use of the W versus t data to describe the process and the model
picture accounting for the recorded data have not been previously reported.

Prediction of High-grade Vesicoureteral Reflux in Children Younger Than 2 Years
Using Renal Sonography.

You SK, Kim JC, Park WH, Lee SM, Cho HH.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the predictive value of renal sonography for
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and the efficacy of renal sonography, technetium Tc
99m–labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning, and a combination of the two
for VUR screening in children younger than 2 years with a first episode of
febrile urinary tract infection.
METHODS: Thirty-eight patients younger than 2 years with a first febrile urinary 
tract infection were included in our study, which was conducted from April
through October 2014. Each kidney was considered a separate renal unit. A
retrospective review of clinical information and images (renal sonography, DMSA
scanning, and voiding cystourethrography) was performed.
RESULTS: Of the 14 renal units (18.4%) with VUR, 4 (28.5%) had high-grade VUR.
Among single findings, dilatation of the renal collecting system, wall thickening
of the renal collecting system, and DMSA scans significantly predicted VUR (P=
.038, .027, and .01, respectively). Dilatation was the most common single finding
(46 of 76 renal units). The sensitivity values for dilatation, wall thickening,
and DMSA scans were 85.7%, 64.2%, and 50.0%, and the negative predictive values
were 93.3%, 89.7%, and 87.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: The negative predictive values indicate that normal renal
sonographic and DMSA findings can predict the absence of high-grade VUR. We
propose that renal sonographic findings of wall thickening as well as dilatation 
of the renal collecting system should be considered predictive of high-grade VUR.

Published guidelines for administered activity to pediatric patients undergoing
diagnostic nuclear medicine imaging are currently obtained through expert
consensus of the minimum values as a function of body weight as required to yield
diagnostic quality images. We have previously shown that consideration of body
habitus is also important in obtaining diagnostic quality images at the lowest
administered activity. The objective of this study was to create a series of
computational phantoms that realistically portray the anatomy of the pediatric
patient population which can be used to develop and validate techniques to
minimize radiation dose while maintaining adequate image quality. To achieve this
objective, we have defined an imaging risk index that may be used in future
studies to develop pediatric patient dosing guidelines. A population of 48 hybrid
phantoms consisting of non-uniform B-spline surfaces and polygon meshes was
generated. The representative ages included the newborn, 1 year, 5 year, 10 year 
and 15 year male and female. For each age, the phantoms were modeled at their
10th, 50th, and 90th height percentile each at a constant 50th weight percentile.
To test the impact of kidney size, the newborn phantoms were modeled with the
following three kidney volumes: -15%, average, and +15%. To illustrate the impact
of different morphologies on dose optimization, we calculated the effective dose 
for each phantom using weight-based (99m)Tc-DMSA activity administration. For a
given patient weight, body habitus had a considerable effect on effective dose.
Substantial variations were observed in the risk index between the 10th and 90th 
percentile height phantoms from the 50th percentile phantoms for a given age,
with the greatest difference being 18%. There was a dependence found between
kidney size and risk of radiation induced kidney cancer, with the highest risk
indices observed in newborns with the smallest kidneys. Overall, the phantoms and
techniques in this study can be used to provide data to refine dosing guidelines 
for pediatric nuclear imaging studies while taking into account the effects on
both radiation dose and image quality.

AIMS: Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is a well-known anticancer drug and is approved by
the FDA for its use in acute promyelocytic leukemia. In this study, anticancer
and antiproliferative mechanism of biocompatible As2O3 nanoparticles was
determined on human prostate cancer cell lines.
MAIN METHODS: In vitro anticancer efficacy of biopolymer coated As2O3 NPs was
investigated in LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines, by assessing DNA damage, changes in
epigenetic modulations, expression level of apoptotic markers and cell cycle
analysis following treatment with As2O3 NPs.
KEY FINDINGS: Our results demonstrate that the nanoparticulate formulation of
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and chitosan coated As2O3 is capable of inducing
morphological changes, DNA damage and caspase-dependent apoptosis along with the 
expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 by upregulation of Bax and
downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. The expression of cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor - p21 was found to be triggered by changes in epigenetic
modifications at histone tails.
SIGNIFICANCE: Biopolymer coated As2O3 nanoparticles induced reversal of mono, di 
and tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 residue. Acetylation of histone H3 
at lysine 14 residue and phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 residue
synergistically activated p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene thereby leading to apoptosis in the
LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Treatment with As2O3 nanoparticles arrested the cells in
G0-G1 and G2-M phase of cell cycle in LNCaP and PC-3 cells respectively. Thus,
biocompatible As2O3 nanoparticles with reduced toxicity to normal cells but the
antiproliferative effect on prostate cancer cell lines follow similar death
pathway as that of bare As2O3 nanoparticles.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the pattern of urinary tract
infection (UTI) and bladder function in women who had experienced recurrent UTI
in childhood, with and without consequent renal damage, and followed for three to
four decades.
METHODS: A population-based cohort of women who had been followed from the first 
UTI in childhood and previously studied at a median age of 27 years was studied
at a median age of 41 years. Renal damage was evaluated by
(99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan. Clinical data were collected on the pattern
of recurrent UTIs and bladder function.
RESULTS: A total of 86 women were investigated, of whom 58 had suffered renal
damage and 28 were without. Febrile UTI in adulthood had occurred in 22 patients,
once in 15 women and twice or more in seven women. There was a change in the
infection pattern over time, evident already in childhood, that was characterized
by a decrease in UTI frequency and a shift from febrile to non-febrile
infections. A significant association was found between renal damage and febrile 
UTI (p = 0.046), and between abnormal bladder function and recurrent non-febrile 
UTI (p = 0.002). There was no relationship between persisting vesicoureteral
reflux (VUR) and proneness to either symptomatic UTI (p = 0.99) or febrile UTI in
adulthood (p = 0.14).
CONCLUSIONS: Among this study cohort there was a continuously decreasing rate of 
febrile UTI in adulthood. Persisting VUR was not related to UTI in adulthood.
Abnormal bladder function was related to non-febrile UTI but not to febrile UTI.

AIMS: This study aims to explore non-invasive imaging of atherosclerotic plaque
through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) by
using profilin-1 targeted magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
(PF1-Cy5.5-DMSA-Fe3O4-NPs, denoted as PC-NPs) as multimodality molecular imaging 
probe in murine model of atherosclerosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: PC-NPs were constructed by conjugating polyclonal profilin-1
antibody and NHS-Cy5.5 fluorescent dye to the surface of DMSA-Fe3O4-nanoparticles
via condensation reaction. Murine atherosclerosis model was induced in apoE(-/-) 
mice by high fat and cholesterol diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. The plaque areas in
aortic artery were detected with Oil Red O staining. Immunofluorescent staining
and Western blot analysis were applied respectively to investigate profilin-1
expression. CCK-8 assay and transwell migration experiment were performed to
detect vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation. In vivo MRI and NIRF
imaging of atherosclerotic plaque were carried out before and 36 h after
intravenous injection of PC-NPs. Oil Red O staining showed that the plaque area
was significantly increased in HFD group (p<0.05). Immunofluorescence staining
revealed that profilin-1 protein was highly abundant within plaque in HFD group
and co-localized with α-smooth muscle actin. Profilin-1 siRNA intervention could 
inhibit VSMCs proliferation and migration elicited by ox-LDL (p<0.05). In vivo
MRI and NIRF imaging revealed that PC-NPs accumulated in atherosclerotic plaque
of carotid artery. There was a good correlation between the signals of MRI and ex
vivo fluorescence intensities of NIRF imaging in animals with PC-NPs injection.
CONCLUSION: PC-NPs is a promising dual modality imaging probe, which may improve 
molecular diagnosis of plaque characteristics and evaluation of pharmaceutical
interventions for atherosclerosis.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate renal dysfunction after stereotactic ablative
body radiotherapy (SABR) for inoperable primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using 
nuclear medicine assessments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective clinical trial, patients received single 
fraction renal SABR (26 Gy) for tumours <5 cm, or fractionated SABR (3 × 14 Gy)
for tumours ⩾5 cm. Global and regional glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was
calculated through (51)Cr-EDTA and (99m)Tc-DMSA SPECT/CT, respectively, at
baseline and post-treatment (14, 90 days and at 1-year). Regional loss in
function was correlated to the absolute and biologically effective doses (BED)
delivered.
RESULTS: In 21 patients the mean (range) tumour size was 48 mm (21-75 mm). The
mean ± SD GFR at baseline was 52 ± 24 ml/min. Net change in mean GFR was +0.6 ±
11.3, +3.2 ± 14.5 and -8.7 ± 13.4 ml/min (p=0.03) at 2 weeks, 3 months and 1
year, respectively. For every 10 Gy of physical dose delivered, an exponential
decline in affected kidney GFR was observed at 39% for 26 Gy/1 fraction and 25%
for 42 Gy/3 fractions. When normalised to BED3Gy, the dose-response relationship 
for each treatment prescription was similar with a plateau beyond 100 Gy. The
R50% conformity index correlated with GFR loss (p=0.04). No patient required
dialysis.
CONCLUSIONS: SABR results in clinically acceptable and dose-dependent renal
dysfunction at 1-year. Sparing functional kidney from high-dose regions (>50%
isodoses) may help reduce risk of functional loss.

In vitro study on apoptotic cell death by effective magnetic hyperthermia with
chitosan-coated MnFe₂O₄.

National University, Busan, 48547, Korea.

Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have been widely investigated as a hyperthermic
agent for cancer treatment. In this study, thermally responsive Chitosan-coated
MnFe2O4 (Chitosan-MnFe2O4) nanoparticles were developed to conduct localized
magnetic hyperthermia for cancer treatment. Hydrophobic MnFe2O4 nanoparticles
were synthesized via thermal decomposition and modified with
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) for further conjugation of chitosan.
Chitosan-MnFe2O4 nanoparticles exhibited high magnetization and excellent
biocompatibility along with low cell cytotoxicity. During magnetic hyperthermia
treatment (MHT) with Chitosan-MnFe2O4 on MDA-MB 231 cancer cells, the targeted
therapeutic temperature was achieved by directly controlling the strength of the 
external AC magnetic fields. In vitro Chitosan-MnFe2O4-assisted MHT at 42 °C led 
to drastic and irreversible changes in cell morphology and eventual cellular
death in association with the induction of apoptosis through heat dissipation
from the excited magnetic nanoparticles. Therefore, the Chitosan-MnFe2O4
nanoparticles with high biocompatibility and thermal capability can be an

BACKGROUND: The radiolanthanide (161)Tb has, in recent years, attracted
increasing interest due to its favorable characteristics for medical application.
(161)Tb exhibits similar properties to the widely-used therapeutic radionuclide
(177)Lu. In contrast to (177)Lu, (161)Tb yields a significant number of
short-ranging Auger/conversion electrons (≤50 keV) during its decay process.
(161)Tb has been shown to be more effective for tumor therapy than (177)Lu if
applied using the same activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate
long-term damage to the kidneys after application of (161)Tb-folate and compare
it to the renal effects caused by (177)Lu-folate.
METHODS: Renal side effects were investigated in nude mice after the application 
of different activities of (161)Tb-folate (10, 20, and 30 MBq per mouse) over a
period of 8 months. Renal function was monitored by the determination of
(99m)Tc-DMSA uptake in the kidneys and by measuring blood urea nitrogen and
creatinine levels in the plasma. Histopathological analysis was performed by
scoring of the tissue damage observed in HE-stained kidney sections from
euthanized mice.
RESULTS: Due to the co-emitted Auger/conversion electrons, the mean absorbed
renal dose of (161)Tb-folate (3.0 Gy/MBq) was about 24 % higher than that of
(177)Lu-folate (2.3 Gy/MBq). After application of (161)Tb-folate, kidney function
was reduced in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as indicated by the decreased
renal uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA and the increased levels of blood urea nitrogen and 
creatinine. Similar results were obtained when (177)Lu-folate was applied at the 
same activity. Histopathological investigations confirmed comparable renal
cortical damage after application of the same activities of (161)Tb-folate and
(177)Lu-folate. This was characterized by collapsed tubules and enlarged
glomeruli with fibrin deposition in moderately injured kidneys and
glomerulosclerosis in severely damaged kidneys.
CONCLUSIONS: Tb-folate induced dose-dependent radionephropathy over time, but did
not result in more severe damage than (177)Lu-folate when applied at the same
activity. These data are an indication that Auger/conversion electrons do not
exacerbate overall renal damage after application with (161)Tb-folate as compared
to (177)Lu-folate, even though they result in an increased dose deposition in the
renal tissue. Global toxicity affecting other tissues than kidneys remains to be 
investigated after (161)Tb-based therapy, however.

BACKGROUND: Validation of the 99mTc-DMSA planar scintigraphy accuracy for split
renal function assessment and comparison with evaluation based on SPECT imaging
both with and without CT attenuation correction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For split renal function assessment two methods were used:
A) planar scintigraphy based on anterior and posterior projections using
correction for kidney depth calculated by the geometric mean; B)
semi-quantitative evaluation based on SPECT (B1) and attenuation-corrected
SPECT/CT (B2) images using locally developed software for kidney segmentation and
voxel-based analysis. All three methods were performed with a phantom simulating 
body including pair of kidneys. For patient study methods A and B1 were applied
on a group of 140 children and adolescents with various renal diseases. Renal
function ratios were compared both mutually and with physically measured activity
ratios in the phantom.
RESULTS: Method A provided results which were closest to measured reference
values (average absolute difference of 0.9 percentage points [pp]). Method B1 was
noticeably worse (2.1pp), whereas attenuation correction (B2) improved tomography
results considerably (1.3 pp). The superiority of planar imaging could be caused 
among others by differences in creation of planar range of interest compared to
tomographic volume of interest. However all the differences were under the
threshold of any clinical importance. The comparison between method A and B1
based on patient study also showed differences mostly of none clinical
importance.
CONCLUSION: Routine evaluation of split renal function using planar technique
with correction of the kidney depth is at least equivalent to tomographic
evaluation, and there is no need to update the established clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: In this study, we present a series of common Tc-labelled
radiopharmaceuticals administrations performed in a busy nuclear medicine
department within a 1-year timeframe in routine practice. The main objective is
to identify the true activity administered to the patient and whether that is in 
compliance with the EANM guidelines, where applicable, and/or with the
department's protocols. As a secondary objective, we aimed to assess whether the 
volume of the injected dose correlates to the percentage of residual activity
measured after injection for each studied radiotracer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A number of commonly used Tc-labelled radiopharmaceuticals
including Tc-pertechnetate, Tc-methylenediphosphonic acid,
Tc-hydroxymethylenediphosphonic acid, Tc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanedicarboxylic 
acid, Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine,
Tc-2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (sestamibi),
Tc-1,2-bis[bis(2-ethoxyethyl)phosphino]ethane (tetrofosmin) and
Tc-HYNIC-Tyr-octreotide (Tektrotyd) were assessed. All data were collected
prospectively within a 1-year period under routine medical practice and included 
(a) injected activity, (b) residual activity, (c) percentage of residual activity
(residual activity/injected activity×100), (d) effective activity (injected
activity minus the residual activity), (e) injected volume, (f) time of injection
and (g) type of procedure.
RESULTS: In the 1837 collected measurements, the average percentage of residual
activity was 13% (95% confidence interval: 12.75-13.39%). The mean effective
activities were within the recommended range by the EANM guidelines, where
applicable, or did not exceed the recommended doses from the department's
protocols. In cases where actual injected activity was lower than the minimum
suggested by the department's protocols, the imaging quality was not compromised.
There was a negative correlation and thus an inverse relationship between the
percentage of residual activity and administered volume for Tc-pertechnetate,
Teceos, Bonescan, HDP, generic DMSA, RENOCIS, Nephromag and Tektrotyd (Spearman's
r coefficient ranging from -0.311 to -0.561). Cardiologic radiotracers presented 
no such correlation.
CONCLUSION: It should be possible to reduce the level of administered activity
for the diagnostic examinations, but with consideration of the residual activity,
especially for radiopharmaceuticals with a high mean residual activity (mainly
tetrofosmin and sestamibi).

BACKGROUND: Targeted alpha therapy has been postulated to have great potential
for the treatment of small clusters of tumour cells as well as small metastases. 
(213)Bismuth, an α-emitter with a half-life of 46 min, has shown to be effective 
in preclinical as well as in clinical applications. In this study, we evaluated
whether (213)Bi-[DOTA(0), Tyr(3)]-octreotate ((213)Bi-DOTATATE), a
(213)Bi-labelled somatostatin analogue with high affinity for somatostatin
receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2), is suitable for the treatment of larger
neuroendocrine tumours overexpressing SSTR2 in comparison to its effectiveness
for smaller tumours. We performed a preclinical targeted radionuclide therapy
study with (213)Bi-DOTATATE in animals bearing tumours of different sizes (50 and
200 mm(3)) using two tumour models: H69 (human small cell lung carcinoma) and
CA20948 (rat pancreatic tumour).
METHODS: Pharmacokinetics was determined for calculation of dosimetry in organs
and tumours. H69- or CA20948-xenografted mice with tumour volumes of
approximately 120 mm(3) were euthanized at 10, 30, 60 and 120 min post injection 
of a single dose of (213)Bi-DOTATATE (1.5-4.8 MBq). To investigate the
therapeutic efficacy of (213)Bi-DOTATATE, xenografted H69 and CA20948
tumour-bearing mice with tumour sizes of 50 and 200 mm(3) were administered daily
with a therapeutic dose of (213)Bi-DOTATATE (0.3 nmol, 2-4 MBq) for three
consecutive days. The animals were followed for 90 days after treatment. At day
90, mice were injected with 25 MBq (99m)Tc-DMSA and imaged by SPECT/CT to
investigate possible renal dysfunction due to (213)Bi-DOTATATE treatment.
RESULTS: Higher tumour uptakes were found in CA20948 tumour-bearing animals
compared to those in H69 tumour-bearing mice with the highest tumour uptake of
19.6 ± 6.6 %IA/g in CA20948 tumour-bearing animals, while for H69 tumour-bearing 
mice, the highest tumour uptake was found to be 9.8 ± 2.4 %IA/g. Nevertheless, as
the anti-tumour effect was more pronounced in H69 tumour-bearing mice, the
survival rate was higher. Furthermore, in the small tumour groups, no regrowth of
tumour was found in two H69 tumour-bearing mice and in one of the CA20948
tumour-bearing mice. No renal dysfunction was observed in
(213)Bi-DOTATATE-treated mice after the doses were applied.
CONCLUSIONS: (213)Bi-DOTATATE demonstrated a great therapeutic effect in both
small and larger tumour lesions. Higher probability for stable disease was found 
in animals with small tumours. (213)Bi-DOTATATE was effective in different
neuroendocrine (H69 and CA20948) tumour models with overexpression of SSTR2 in
mice.

AIM: Treatment modalities of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) consist of antimicrobial
prophylaxis and antireflux surgery. In this study, we aimed to determine if
antireflux surgery changes the course of renal functional deterioration in
children with VUR and urinary tract infections (UTI).
METHODS: Medical files of patients with VUR diagnosed during evaluation for UTI
were evaluated retrospectively for gender, age, follow-up period, and renal
ultrasonography (US) and serial 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA)
scintigraphy findings. Estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary protein
levels were determined at the initial and last visits, and before the operation
in children who had antireflux surgery. The patients were divided into two groups
as solely medically treated (Group 1) and both medically and surgically treated
(Group 2). Group 2 was further divided as those with stable renal function (Group
2a) and with progressive renal injury (Group 2b).
RESULTS: There were 140 patients (77 female; mean age 51.6 ± 51.9 months). Group 
1 and Group 2 included 82 and 58 patients, respectively. In Group 2, the number
of patients with the abnormal US, DMSA scintigraphy, and renal function was
higher than in Group 1. Recurrent UTI rate was similar, but progressive scarring 
was more prominent in the antireflux surgery group. In Group 2, 31 patients had a
stable renal function (Group 2a) while 27 had progressive deterioration of renal 
functions (Group 2b). These subgroups were not different with respect to the rate
of high-grade VUR, the presence of a renal scar in DMSA, and UTI recurrence.
However, the bilateral renal scar was more common in Group 2b.
CONCLUSION: Antireflux surgery does not change the course of ongoing renal injury
and renal functional deterioration.

BACKGROUND: Acute renal infarction is a rare condition whose diagnosis is often
delayed. Major risk factors include atrial fibrillation, valvular or ischemic
heart disease, renal artery thrombosis/dissection and coagulopathy.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 18 patients admitted to our
Nephrology Department between 1999 and 2015 for acute renal infarction diagnosed 
by computed tomography. Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy was
performed in some patients during follow-up to assess parenchymal lesions and
estimate differential kidney function.
RESULTS: Mean age was 59.8 years. Major associated risk factors included
hypertension (44 %), obesity (33 %), atrial fibrillation (28 %), peripheral
vascular disease (17 %), smoking (17 %), prior thromboembolic event (11 %),
diabetes (11 %), estroprogestinic therapy (11 %). Seventy-two percent of patients
presented with flank pain. Mean serum creatinine was 1.2 ± 0.6 mg/dl. Acute
kidney injury occurred as the initial manifestation in two patients. Patients
were managed conservatively, with low molecular weight heparin (83 %) or aspirin 
(11 %). At the end of follow-up serum creatinine was 1.1 ± 0.3 mg/dl; one patient
remained on chronic hemodialysis. 58 % of patients who underwent renal
scintigraphy after a median of 8 months had a reduced contribution of the
previously affected kidney to total renal function.
CONCLUSION: Risk factors associated with the development of chronic kidney
disease following renal infarction are unknown. In our subjects, renal function
remained stable in all but one patient who developed end stage renal disease.
Further studies should focus on etiology and evolution of kidney function in
patients with acute renal infarction.

Preparation of Amyloid Immuno-Nanoparticles as Potential MRI Contrast Agents for 
Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.

Yin Z, Yul T, Xu Y.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia which is caused by
accumulation in the brain of plaques made up of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta).
Research on nanosized systems indicated that nanoparticles (NPs) could pass
across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and improve the visibility of internal body 
structures in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which made it possible to aid the
early diagnosis of AD. In this research study we synthesized magnetite
nanoparticles by high-temperature solution-phase reaction, transferred into water
based on a ligand exchange process and coated with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
(DMSA). Subsequently, the anti-amyloid Abeta immunomagnetic nanoparticles (IMNPs)
were prepared by grafting anti-amyloid antibodies on the surface of the
DMSA-coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) method was introduced to evaluate the IMNPs activity and conjugation
amount of antibodies. The biocompatibility of the IMNPs was tested by
colony-forming assay. The results showed that the anti-amyloid Abeta IMNPs were
biocompatible and biologically active, as well as effective in enhancing MRI
solution, indicating that the IMNPs could be used as potential MRI contrast
agents and targeted carriers for AD early diagnosis and therapy.

Manufactured nanomaterials have a variety of medical applications, including
diagnosis and targeted treatment of cancer. A series of experiments were
conducted to determine the pharmacokinetic, biodistribution and biocompatibility 
of two novel magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in the anaesthetized pig.
Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles 
(MF66-labelled 12 nm, core nominal diameter and OD15 15 nm); at 0.5, or
2.0 mg/kg) were injected intravenously. Particles induced a dose-dependent
decrease in blood pressure following administration which recovered to control
levels several minutes after injection. Blood samples were collected for a 5-h
period and stored for determination of particle concentration using particle
electron paramagnetic resonance (pEPR). Organs were harvested post-mortem for
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI at 1.5 T field strength) and histology. OD15
(2.0 mg/kg) MNP had a plasma half-life of approximately 15 min. Both doses of the
MF66 (0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg) MNP were below detection limits. MNP accumulation was
observed primarily in the liver and spleen with MRI scans which was confirmed by 
histology. MRI also showed that both MNPs were present in the lungs. The results 
show that further modifications may be required to improve the biocompatibility
of these particles for use as diagnostic and therapeutic agents.

Accurate and early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of patient with urinary
tract infection (UTI) are essential for the prevention or restriction of
permanent damage to the kidneys in children. The aim of this study was to compare
renal ultrasonography (US) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in the
diagnosis of patients with febrile urinary tract infection. This study involved
the medical records of children with febrile urinary tract infection who were
admitted to the children's hospital in Qazvin, Iran. Pyelonephritis was diagnosed
on the basis of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and abnormal DMSA renal
scans. The criteria for abnormality of renal US were an increase or a decrease in
diffuse or focal parenchymal echogenicity, loss of corticomedullary
differentiation, kidney position irregularities, parenchymal reduction and
increased kidney size. Of the 100 study patients, 23% had an abnormal US and 46% 
had an abnormal DMSA renal scan. Of the latter patients, 15 had concurrent
abnormal US (P value ≤ 0.03, concordance rate: 18%). Renal US had a sensitivity
of 32%, specificity of 85%, positive predictive value of 65% and negative
predictive value of 60%. Of the 77 patients with normal US, 31 (40.2%) had an
abnormal DMSA renal scan. Despite the benefits and accessibility of renal US, its
value in the diagnosis of pyelonephritis is limited.

Mean platelet volume (MPV) has not yet been well-established in urinary tract
infection (UTI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of MPV as an 
acute phase reactant in children with UTI. Data from 118 young children (<2
years) with UTI between 2012 and 2013 were grouped as acute pyelonephritis (APN) 
and lower UTI according to the dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan abnormalities.
MPV, platelet distribution width (PDW) platelet count, and other infection
markers (white blood cell [WBC] count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], and 
C-reactive protein [CRP]) were measured. WBC (P = 0.001), ESR (P = 0.005), CRP
(P < 0.001) and MPV levels (P = 0.011) were significantly higher in the APN group
than those in the lower UTI group. MPV positively correlated with PDW, CRP and
negatively with platelet count. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that
CRP and MPV were independent predictive factors for APN patients. However, the
area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for MPV was
lower than CRP. Our results suggest that MPV can be an inflammatory marker in
UTI, but the predictive value of MPV was not superior to CRP in the diagnosis of 
APN.

Many risk factors may contribute to renal disease in patients with hemophilia
A.AIM: We aimed to evaluate functional and structural renal abnormalities among a
group of Egyptian children with severe and moderate hemophilia A using
technetium-99m diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid ((99m)Tc-DTPA) and
technetium-99 m dimercaptusuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) scan. We also aimed to
determine the relation between these abnormalities and different risk factors and
disease severity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty male patients, 16 with severe and 24 with moderate
hemophilia A, were enrolled in this study. Their mean age was 10.2 ± 4.3 years
(range, 5-17 years). Full history taking, clinical examination, laboratory, and
radionuclide investigations including serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen
(BUN), urine analysis, creatinine clearance, 24-hour urinary protein,
(99m)Tc-DTPA scan, and (99m)Tc-DMSA scan were performed to all enrolled patients.
RESULTS: Serum creatinine and BUN were normal in all patients, and corrected
creatinine clearance was diminished in 2 patients. However, (99m)Tc-DTPA results 
yielded 19 (47.5%) patients with diminished glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
Moreover, it showed that 14 (35%) had obstructive uropathy, 15 (37.5%) had
obstructive nephropathy, while 11 (27.5%) patients showed normal scan. One
patient had atrophy of 1 kidney on (99m)Tc-DMSA scan. Among our cohort, 5 (12.5%)
patients were hypertensive. Microscopic hematuria was detected in 14 (35%)
patients while 72.5% had proteinuria. We found an association between hematuria
and hypertension with diminished GFR.
CONCLUSION: Despite normal kidney functions (serum creatinine and BUN), we found 
a high rate of diminished GFR and obstructive uropathy and nephropathy as
detected by (99m)Tc-DTPA scan among children with hemophilia A.

In this work, we analyzed the effects of subtle changes in the synthetic
conditions and synthetic parameters on the resulting size, shape, monodispersity,
crystallinity and magnetic properties of iron oxide nanocrystals (IONCs) obtained
through a modified one pot method for the production of mainly cubic-shaped
nanoparticles (NPs). Cubic, octahedral and cuboctahedral shapes with different
sizes and monodispersity could be obtained by slightly changing the
stabilizer/precursor molar ratio, the precursor concentration, the reaction time 
and temperature and/or the heating rate. Their physical properties were evaluated
using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and a
superconducting quantum interference (SQUID) device. It was found that
monodisperse cubic nanocrystals from ca. 25 to 94 nm could be obtained either by 
changing the precursor concentration, the heating rate or the reaction time.
These cubic nanocrystals were ferrimagnetic in the whole temperature rage
analyzed, with saturation magnetization values even larger than those of bulk
magnetite. In addition, slightly truncated octahedral NPs could be achieved at
relatively large heating ramp rates, whereas cubooctahedral NPs were derived by
simply increasing the stabilizer/precursor molar ratio. The saturation
magnetization of both types of NPs was slightly lower than the cubic ones, but
they were still ferrimagnetic in the whole temperature range analyzed. Moreover, 
transfer to aqueous solution was possible by a ligand exchange with
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) providing, at the same time, chemical groups for
additional functionalization if required. The DMSA-coated cubic IONCs were fairly
stable in culture medium, allowing their internalization by different cell types.
The NPs inside the cells were located in the cytoplasm and most of them showed a 
perinuclear distribution. Moreover, a great cytocompatibility in a large range of
particle concentrations was observed without the induction of morphological
changes in the cultured cells.

PURPOSE: We investigated whether C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, urine
protein-creatinine ratio (uProt/Cr), and urine electrolytes can be useful for
discriminating acute pyelonephritis (APN) from other febrile illnesses or the
presence of a cortical defect on 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning
(true APN) from its absence in infants with febrile urinary tract infection
(UTI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 150 infants experiencing their first febrile
UTI and 100 controls with other febrile illnesses consecutively admitted to our
hospital from January 2010 to December 2012. Blood (CRP, electrolytes, Cr) and
urine tests [uProt/Cr, electrolytes, and sodium-potassium ratio (uNa/K)] were
performed upon admission. All infants with UTI underwent DMSA scans during
admission. All data were compared between infants with UTI and controls and
between infants with or without a cortical defect on DMSA scans. Using multiple
logistic regression analysis, the ability of the parameters to predict true APN
was analyzed.
RESULTS: CRP levels and uProt/Cr were significantly higher in infants with true
APN than in controls. uNa levels and uNa/K were significantly lower in infants
with true APN than in controls. CRP levels and uNa/K were relevant factors for
predicting true APN. The method using CRP levels, u-Prot/Cr, u-Na levels, and
uNa/K had a sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 65%, positive predictive value of 
60%, and negative predictive value of 95% for predicting true APN.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that these parameters are useful for discriminating APN
from other febrile illnesses or discriminating true APN in infants with febrile
UTI.

INTRODUCTION: Investigations following urinary tract infection (UTI) aim to
identify children who are prone to renal scarring, which may be preventable. In
2002, in an attempt to reduce unnecessary intervention, the present institution
standardised the investigation of children with a confirmed UTI.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the significance of urological
abnormalities on investigations following a UTI in children, prior to the
introduction of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
guidelines.
METHODS: Clinical information on the first 1000 patients was retrieved from a
prospective UTI hospital database. The follow-up period was 10 years.
RESULTS: There were 180 males and 820 females (M:F = 1:4.5). The median age of
presentation was 5 years (range 11 days-16 years). A renal ultrasound (US) was
performed on all patients, and was normal in 93% of cases (n = 889) (see Figure).
Of the 7% who had an abnormal US (n = 71), 54 were female and 17 male (M:F =
1:3). A total of 372 DMSA scans were requested and 350 attended their
appointment. Of these, 278 cases (79%) were reported as normal, while 72 had an
abnormality documented. Of these 72 patients with abnormalities on DMSA scan, 49 
had a repeat DMSA scan: 30 demonstrated permanent scarring, while the DMSA scan
became normal in 19. Sixteen of the 278 patients whose DMSA scan was initially
normal had a repeat DMSA scan due to symptoms, and all scans were normal. Twelve 
(1.2%) patients required surgical intervention: three underwent circumcision for 
recurrent UTIs; three underwent endoscopic treatment of VUR; one had a PUV
resection; one underwent a cystoscopy; three had a pyeloplasty for pelvi-ureteric
junction obstruction; and one had a ureteric reimplantation for vesico-ureteric
junction obstruction. After initial investigations and management, 936 patients
were discharged from the UTI clinic: 47 of them re-presented - 40 with recurrent 
UTIs and seven with dysuria. Thirty-five of the 47 children who re-presented with
urological symptoms underwent a DMSA scan, which showed scarring in three (6%).
DISCUSSION: Only 12% of children have a significant radiological abnormality
picked up on investigation following a UTI. The present investigation approach
differed from the NICE guidelines, where imaging is based on patient age and
characteristics of the UTI. All children had a renal US, while DMSA scans were
reserved for those children <1 year of age or those with upper tract symptoms.
The present protocol recommended a renal US in all children presenting with a
UTI. This promptly identified those with pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction and 
those with PUV, who all presented >6 months of age with a single UTI and,
therefore, based on the NICE guidelines would not have undergone a renal US. Of
the children who re-presented with further UTIs, a significant number were found 
to have dysfunctional voiding. As this link is well reported, it may be
appropriate to screen for this in older children at initial presentation. Only
three patients, who had a US at presentation, were subsequently found to have
scarring on DMSA. After 10 years of follow-up, this could represent a false
negative rate of 0.3% for the screening programme. None of the girls were found
to have VUR or needed any surgical intervention, which suggested that early
identification of the scarring might not have altered management. Few patients
required surgical intervention, all of whom were identified early. No patient who
re-presented required intervention. This would suggest that the present protocol 
is effective at picking up abnormalities that require surgical management.
CONCLUSION: This study suggested that after a childhood UTI, the liberal use of
renal ultrasound and a focused 'top down' approach to investigation is likely to 
identify the vast majority of children who require intervention.

INTRODUCTION: There is no well-defined follow-up scheme available to reliably
detect persistent or recurrent vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) after endoscopic
therapy (ET), but also to reduce postoperative invasive diagnostics in these
children. Our aim was the evaluation of possible predictors of persistence and
recurrence of VUR, in order to elaborate and test a risk-adapted follow-up
regimen.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 92 patients (85/92%f, 7/8%m, age 2.99y) underwent direct
isotope cystography (DIC) three months after ET. Persistent or recurrent VUR,
scarring on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans and further fUTIs after therapy 
(follow-up 24.6 m) were documented and analysed.
RESULTS: VUR persistence 3 months after ET was found in 11 (11.9%) patients;
recurrent VUR in 4 (4.3%) patients. Scarring on preoperative DMSA and dilating
VUR (°III and °IV) were significantly associated with recurrent VUR. If only
children with preoperative positive DMSA scan or dilating VUR would have
undergone DIC, only 58/92 DICs (64%) would have been necessary. Only 45.5% of
otherwise detected VURs would have been identified using this risk-adapted
strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Limiting invasive follow-up diagnostics (VCUG) and, therewith, the
radiation burden in a predefined group of patients at risk for persistence or
recurrence of VUR is not recommended, due to the significant chance of missing
persistent or new onset contralateral VUR. Therefore, we recommend a routine
follow-up VCUG after ET. Further prospective scientific efforts to evaluate new, 
alternative factors influencing persistence and recurrence of VUR, in order to
establish an effective follow-up strategy, are warranted.

PURPOSE: This study examined the relationship between urinary microprotein
concentrations and renal functional parameters in children with dilating (grade
III-V) vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) who underwent either medical or surgical
treatment.
METHODS: All 44 dilating VUR patients who were followed for 4 years were screened
for inclusion in this study. The patients' clinical features and clinical
outcomes, as well as the urinary activities of albumin (ALB), transferrin (TRF), 
immunoglobulin G (IgG), alpha-1-microglobulin (α1-MG), and
N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase (NAG), were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: High values of NAG, α1-MG, IgG, TRF, and ALB were noted in 73.33, 58.33,
43.33, 24.14, and 53.33 % of patients, respectively, at the first examination.
Cystatin C, eGFR, and urinary microprotein levels were associated with a good
prognosis after 4 years of follow-up. No differences in recurrent UTI, cystatin C
concentration, most microprotein/creatinine (Cr) ratios, eGFR, or ΔGFR4 % were
found between the groups. High levels of urinary proteins were found in 2.38-9.52
% of cases after 4 years of follow-up. ALB/Cr, IgG/Cr, and α1-MG/Cr levels were
positively correlated with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) grade, and α1-MG 
excretion was inversely correlated with eGFR.
CONCLUSIONS: The levels of microprotein were elevated at diagnosis in a higher
proportion of patients than for the other markers examined. At long-term
follow-up, the reflux level had decreased or completely resolved in all patients,
and the proportions of microproteins that were elevated were significantly
reduced. Renal impairment measured by eGFR and DMSA grade was related to
increased urinary α1-MG levels.

Magnetic nanoparticles can be used for numerous in vitro and in vivo
applications. However, since uptake by the reticuloendothelial system represents 
an obstacle for the achievement of nanoparticle diagnostic and therapeutic goals,
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the uptake of dimercaptosuccinic
acid coated magnetic nanoparticles by reticuloendothelial system phagocytic cells
present in lymph nodes, spleen, and liver tissue and how the presence of these
particles could have an impact on the morphology of these organs in capuchin
monkeys (Sapajus spp.). Animals were intravenously injected with
dimercaptosuccinic acid coated magnetic nanoparticles and euthanized 12 hours and
90 days post-injection. Organs were processed by transmission electron microscopy
and histological techniques. Samples of spleen and lymph nodes showed no
morphological changes. Nevertheless, liver samples collected 90 days
post-administration showed slight morphological alteration in space of Disse.
Moreover, morphometrical analysis of hepatic mitochondria was performed,
suggesting a clear positive correlation between mitochondrial area and
dimercaptosuccinic acid coated magnetic nanoparticles administration time. The
present results are directly relevant to current safety considerations in
clinical diagnostic and therapeutic uses of magnetic nanoparticles.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of the Randomized Intervention for
Children with Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) trial were to evaluate the role of
antimicrobial prophylaxis in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection 
(UTI) and renal scarring in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). We present
a comprehensive evaluation of renal scarring outcomes in RIVUR trial
participants.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This multicenter, randomized,
placebo-controlled trial enrolled 607 children aged 2-71 months with grade 1-4
VUR diagnosed after a first or second febrile or symptomatic UTI. Study
participants received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo and were followed 
for 2 years. Renal scarring was evaluated by baseline and follow-up
(99m)technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans that were reviewed
independently by two blinded reference radiologists.
RESULTS: At the end of the study, 58 (10%) of 599 children and 63 (5%) of 1197
renal units had renal scarring. New renal scarring did not differ between the
prophylaxis and placebo groups (6% versus 7%, respectively). Children with renal 
scarring were significantly older (median age, 26 versus 11 months; P=0.01), had 
a second UTI before enrollment (odds ratio [OR], 2.85; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 1.38 to 5.92), were more likely to be Hispanic (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.13 
to 4.34), and had higher grades of VUR (OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.56 to 5.0). The
proportion of new scars in renal units with grade 4 VUR was significantly higher 
than in units with no VUR (OR, 24.2; 95% CI, 6.4 to 91.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more renal scarring was seen in relatively older
children and in those with a second episode of febrile or symptomatic UTI before 
randomization. Preexisting and new renal scars occurred significantly more in
renal units with grade 4 VUR than in those with low-grade or no VUR.
Antimicrobial prophylaxis did not decrease the risk of renal scarring.

INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common query in pediatric
radiology. Imaging for and after UTI is still a heavily debated topic with
different approaches, as thorough evidence to decide upon a definite algorithm is
scarce.
CONTENT AND OBJECTIVE: This review article tries to address the clinical rational
of the various approaches (general imaging, top-down or bottom-up, selected and
individualized imaging concepts…), describes the available imaging modalities and
the respective findings in imaging children with UTI, and proposes an imaging
algorithm for the work-up of children during and after UTI discussing the "pros
and cons" of the different attitudes.
CONCLUSION: In summary, imaging by US is generally considered for all infants and
children with a febrile or complicated (upper) UTI, particularly without
previously known urinary tract anatomy. The further work-up (searching for renal 
scarring and assessment of vesico-ureteric reflux) is then decided according to
these initial findings as well as the clinical presentation, course, and
scenario.

Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

AIM: Little is known about the association between renal cyst and renal
dysfunction. We evaluated the deterioration of renal function in patients with
unilateral, large, simple renal cysts.
METHODS: Fifty patients with unilateral, simple renal cysts measuring ≥ 4 cm
(cyst group) and 50 kidney donors (control group) were enrolled.
Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans were performed to calculate split
renal function. The differences between split renal function were calculated and 
compared. Clinical factors affecting decreased renal function in the cyst group
were assessed.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients in the cyst group was higher than the
control group (59.1 vs 39.2 years; P = 0.001). Patients with renal cysts tended
to be diagnosed with hypertension (P = 0.001), However, the two groups did not
significantly differ in terms of the other characteristics. The median cyst size 
was 7.2 cm (range, 4.5-14.2), and 31 of the 50 patients (60.2%) in the cyst group
demonstrated decreased renal function in the cystic kidney units (median: 5.8%;
range, 0.2-33). Although there were no differences in split renal function (50.1%
vs 49.9%; P = 0.629) in the control group, the relative renal function of the
cystic kidney units were significantly lower than the contralateral kidney units 
in the cyst group (48.3% vs 51.7%; P = 0.001). The decrease in relative renal
function (>8%) in the cystic kidney units was associated with a higher serum uric
acid levels and higher RENAL complexity (P = 0.035 and P = 0.007, respectively).
CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of unilateral, large, simple renal cysts are
associated with decreased relative renal function on DMSA renal scans.

We report a case of an ectopic/hypoplastic kidney removed by radio-guided
surgery. A 7-year-old girl, with a history of vaginal drainage of urine,
underwent renal scintigraphy with Tc-DMSA. SPECT/CT revealed a focal uptake in
the pelvis, corresponding to hypoplastic kidney as confirmed by MRI. Based on
SPECT/CT findings, the patient underwent laparoscopic surgery, using Tc-DMSA scan
to help the surgeon to detect the small ectopic kidney. Intraoperatory
histological report confirmed the renal origin of the specimen.

A 22-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with symptoms of
chest discomfort after a suicide attempt by injecting intravenously the amount of
mercury extracted from 3 thermometers mixed with alcohol. At presentation, the
patient was well oriented with normal vital signs, but a few hours later she
presented an abrupt deterioration of her mental status, with confusion,
disorientation, tremor and finally stupor. She was transferred to the intensive
care unit for monitoring and therapy. A nasogastric tube was immediately placed
and the patient received treatment with a chelating agent dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA)/succimer 800 mg orally three times a day, a dosage decided on the basis of
her body weight, plus phenytoin 125 mg intravenously three times a day. Two hours
after treatment initiation, the patient reported a remarkable improvement of her 
symptoms. However, she experienced seizures during a 6-month period after her
discharge.

PURPOSE: To investigate the proper diagnostic modalities and failure cases of
treatment in patients with single-system ectopic ureter (SSEU) who underwent
nephrectomy for incontinence.
METHODS: SSEU combined with dysplastic kidney is a rare cause of female
incontinence. We retrospectively analyzed 45 pediatric SSEU patients that
underwent simple nephrectomy at our institution during 1996-2013 for
incontinence. We reviewed imaging studies to detect dysplastic kidney and ectopic
ureter insertion, postoperative results, and urodynamic findings for remaining
incontinence after nephrectomy.
RESULTS: Median operative age was 59.3months. Both ultrasonography and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) showed 50.0% dysplastic kidney detection rates
respectively. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning and computerized tomography
(CT) showed equal detection rates of 95.5%. Ectopic ureter insertion sites were
determined by ultrasonography, CT, and MRI in 17.5%, 13.6%, and 33.3% of
patients, respectively. Renal vascular structures were identified in 3/22
patients (13.6%) with CT. Post-nephrectomy, incontinence disappeared in 41
patients (91.1%), but remained in 4 patients (8.9%); urodynamics suggested
bladder neck incompetence in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: DMSA is a highly sensitive diagnostic modality for detecting
dysplastic kidney in SSEU patients with more than 95% detection rates. Once
detected by DMSA, additional CT or MRI studies do not provide further information
about ectopic ureter insertion or renal vascular structure. Although nephrectomy 
is successful in nearly 90% of SSEU patients with dysplastic kidneys,
postoperative incontinence occasionally remains and requires additional
treatment.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is an analog of dimercaprol used as metal
chelating moiety in variety of conditions. In nuclear medicine itself two types
of Tc-99m DMSA complexes are used, trivalent and pentavalent forms. In this
review, we have discussed the mechanism of uptake of both complexes as well as
diagnostic and therapeutic application in a clinical scenario.

PURPOSE: We reviewed renal function after pyeloplasty (PP) in cases of prenatally
diagnosed ureteropelvic junction obstruction (PDUPJO) to determine the impact of 
preoperative urinary tract infection (UTI) on the timing of PP.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 81 cases of PDUPJO diagnosed between 1998
and 2013. Incidence of UTI was used to divide 37 kidneys requiring PP (3
bilateral) into U(-): UTI≤1; n=25, and U(+): UTI≥2; n=12 to compare age at PP,
grade of hydronephrosis (HN) on ultrasonography (US), glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) on diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DTPA) renography, and uptake on
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy pre/post PP.
RESULTS: Age at first UTI and age at PP were similar. HN improved significantly
postPP in all cases. Although DTPA and DMSA were similar prePP, improvement
postPP was better in U(-) than U(+), but only DMSA in U(-) was statistically
significant (15.2%±4.0% vs. 20%±3.7%; p=0.049). There were no complications or
UTI postPP.
CONCLUSION: Two or more UTIs would appear to be associated with postPP renal
dysfunction in PDUPJO. Thus, PP should be performed after the initial UTI but
before the second UTI.

The uptake of mercury species in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster was
investigated by elemental bioimaging using laser ablation-inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). The mercury distribution in Drosophila
melanogaster was analyzed for the three species mercury(II) chloride,
methylmercury chloride, and thimerosal after intoxication. A respective
analytical method was developed and applied to the analysis of the entire
Drosophila melanogaster first, before a particular focus was directed to the
cerebral areas of larvae and adult flies. For quantification of mercury,
matrix-matched standards based on gelatin were prepared. Challenges of spatially 
dissolved mercury determination, namely, strong evaporation issues of the
analytes and an inhomogeneous distribution of mercury in the standards due to
interactions with cysteine containing proteins of the gelatin were successfully
addressed by complexation with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). No
mercury was detected in the cerebral region for mercury(II) chloride, whereas
both organic species showed the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.
Quantitatively, the mercury level in the brain exceeded the fed concentration
indicating mercury enrichment, which was approximately 3 times higher for
methylmercury chloride than for thimerosal.

This study was conducted to determine the serum concentration of zinc in children
with acute pyelonephritis. Serum zinc levels of 60 children with acute
pyelonephritis and 60 healthy children were compared. Acute pyelonephritis was
diagnosed using Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan. Serum zinc
levels were measured by the atomic absorption flame spectrophotometry. The levels
in question in the case and control groups were 70.73 ± 14.15 and 87.61 ± 12.68
mcg/dL, respectively (P=0.001). There was no correlation between serum zinc level
with inflammatory markers, severity of acute pyelonephritis and duration of the
disease. This study showed that there is a correlation between serum zinc level
and acute pyelonephritis. Zinc would therefore appear to play a certain role in
the pathogenesis of acute pyelonephritis.

Long-term in vivo studies in murine models have shown that DMSA-coated
nanoparticles accumulate in spleen, liver and lung tissues during extended
periods of time (at least up to 3 months) without any significant signs of
toxicity detected. During that time, nanoparticles undergo a process of
biotransformation either by reducing the size or the particle aggregation or
both. Using a rat model, we have evaluated the transformations of magnetic
nanoparticles injected at low doses. Particles with two different coatings,
dimercaptosuccinic acid (NP-DMSA) and polyethylene glycol (NP-PEG-(NH2)2) have
been administered to animals, to evaluate the role of coating in the degradation 
of the particles. We have found that low doses of magnetic nanoparticles are
quickly metabolized by the animals. In fact, using a nanoparticle dose four times
lower than in previous experiments, NP-DMSA were not observed 24 h after the
administration either in the liver or in the lungs. Interestingly, an increased
amount of ferritin, the iron storage protein, was observed in liver tissues from 
rats that were treated with the low dose of NP-DMSA in comparison with the
control ones, suggesting a rapid metabolization of the particles into ferritin
iron. On the other side we have found that, NP-PEG-(NH2)2 are still detectable in
several organs 24 h after their administration at low doses. Probably, due to the
longer circulation times of the NP-PEG-(NH2)2, there is a delay in the arrival of
the particles to the tissue and this is the reason why we are able to see the
particles 24 h post-administration. PEG coating could also be protecting the
nanoparticles from rapid degradation of the reticuloendothelial system. Knowledge
on the biodistribution, circulation time and degradation processes is required to
gain a better understanding of the safety evaluation of this kind of nanomaterial
for biomedical applications.

The dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was widely used to coat iron oxide
nanoparticles (FeNPs); however, its intracellular cytotoxicity remains to be
adequately elucidated. This study analyzed the differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) in four mammalian cells treated by a DMSA-coated magnetite FeNP at various
doses at different times. The results revealed that about one-fourth of DEGs
coded cysteine-rich proteins (CRPs) in all cells under each treatment, indicating
that the nanoparticles greatly affected the expressions of CRP-coding genes.
Additionally, about 26% of CRP-coding DEGs were enzyme genes in all cells,
indicating that the nanoparticles greatly affected the expression of enzyme
genes. Further experiments with the nanoparticles and a polyethylenimine
(PEI)-coated magnetite FeNP revealed that the effect mainly resulted from DMSA
carried into cells by the nanoparticles. This study thus first reported the
cytotoxicity of DMSA at the gene transcription level as coating molecules of
FeNPs. This study provides new insight into the molecular mechanism by which the 
DMSA-coated nanoparticles resulted in the transcriptional changes of many
CRP-coding genes in cells. This study draws attention toward the intracellular
cytotoxicity of DMSA as a coating molecule of nanoparticles, which has very low
toxicity as an orally administered antidote due to its extracellular
distribution.

AIM: To determine the nature of primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and the
association of VUR with hydronephrosis and renal damage.
METHODS: The medical records of children ≤ 15 years diagnosed with VUR, attending
the Department of Pediatrics, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand between 1987
and 2013 were reviewed. Renal ultrasound and technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic
acid renal scan (DMSA) results were examined to determine the severity of
hydronephrosis and renal damage, respectively.
RESULTS: There were 177 boys and 211 girls. 350 (90.2%) were diagnosed following 
urinary tract infection (UTI). The median (IQR) age at diagnosis of first VUR was
7.6 (4.3-12.2) months in boys and 18.6 (9.0-46.6) months in girls (P < 0.001).
Renal ultrasound was performed in 340 patients. Hydronephrosis was found in 105
patients and 135 kidneys and 22.5% VUR kidneys and 11.0% non-VUR kidneys
(P = 0.01). The severity of hydronephrosis was associated with VUR grade (44.2%
of grades IV and V VUR had hydronephrosis vs 11.9% of grades I-III VUR,
P < 0.001). DMSA was performed in 332 patients. Abnormalities were found in 30.1%
VUR kidneys and 4.1% non-VUR kidneys (P < 0.001). Abnormal DMSA results were
strongly associated with VUR grade (17.8% for VUR grades I-III vs 60.5% for VUR
grades IV and V, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Primary VUR in this group was most commonly diagnosed following
investigation of UTI and detected during infancy, earlier in boys. Hydronephrosis
and renal damage were associated with severity of VUR.

The role of alkoxy radicals in the heterogeneous reaction of two structural
isomers of dimethylsuccinic acid.

Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. mnchan@cuhk.edu.hk.

A key challenge in understanding the transformation chemistry of organic aerosols
is to quantify how changes in molecular structure alter heterogeneous reaction
mechanisms. Here we use two model systems to investigate how the relative
locations of branched methyl groups control the heterogeneous reaction of OH with
two isomers of dimethylsuccinic acid (C6H10O4). 2,2-Dimethylsuccinic acid
(2,2-DMSA) and 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (2,3-DMSA) differ only in the location
of the two branched methyl groups, thus enabling a closer inspection of how the
distribution of carbon reaction sites impacts the chemical evolution of the
aerosol. The heterogeneous reaction of OH with 2,3-DMSA (reactive OH uptake
coefficient, γ = 0.99 ± 0.16) is found to be ∼2 times faster than that of
2,2-DMSA (γ = 0.41 ± 0.07), which is attributed to the larger stability of the
tertiary alkyl radical produced by the initial OH abstraction reaction. While
changes in the average aerosol oxidation state (OSC) and the carbon number (NC)
are similar for both isomers upon reaction, significant differences are observed 
in the underlying molecular distribution of reaction products. The reaction of OH
with the 2,3-DMSA isomer produces two major reaction products: a product
containing a new alcohol functional group (C6H10O5) formed by intermolecular
hydrogen abstraction and a C5 compound formed via carbon-carbon (C-C) bond
scission. Both of these reaction products are explained by the formation and
subsequent reaction of a tertiary alkoxy radical. In contrast, the OH reaction
with the 2,2-DMSA isomer forms four dominant reaction products, the majority of
which are C5 scission products. The difference in the quantity of C-C bond
scission products for these two isomers is unexpected since decomposition is
assumed to be favored for the isomer with the most tertiary carbon sites (i.e.
2,3-DMSA). For both isomers, there is a much larger abundance of C6 alcohol
relative to C6 ketone products, which suggests that the presence of the two
branched methyl groups favors alkoxy formation from peroxy radical
self-reactions. These results reveal how the isomeric structure ultimately
controls the overall competition between functionalization and fragmentation in
these model systems.

The Gorham-Stout disease is a very rare condition, characterized by
lymphovascular proliferation and massive bone resorption. We present a
48-year-old male patient with osteolysis involving the left femoral head and
neck, as well as to the ipsilateral acetabulum. Besides the morphological
imaging, he underwent bone scintigraphy, technetium-99m-V-dimercaptosuccinic acid
[99mTc(V)-DMSA] single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography
(SPECT/CT) and histological examination. Together these findings gave the
definitive diagnosis. This is the first case ever published with 99mTc(V)-DMSA
SPECT-CT. Advances on the knowledge of disease suggests that this imaging
procedure could have utility in diagnosis and evaluation of the disease activity 
and therapy response.

Fish has many health benefits but is also the most common source of
methylmercury. The bioavailability of methylmercury in fish may be affected by
other meal components. In this study, the effect of green tea on the
bioavailability of methylmercury from an oral bolus of fish muscle tissue was
studied in rats and compared to a water treated control group and a group treated
with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), a compound used medically to
chelate mercury. Rats were given a single oral dose of fish tissue via gavage and
one of the treatments. Rats were given access to food for 3 h at 12 h intervals. 
They were dosed with each of the treatments with each meal. Blood samples were
collected for 95 hours. Green tea significantly increased the concentration of
total mercury in blood relative to the control, whereas DMSA significantly
decreased it. In addition, feeding caused a slight increase in blood mercury for 
several meals following the initial dose.

Many bacterial respiratory redox enzymes depend on the twin-arginine translocase 
(Tat) system for translocation and membrane insertion. Tat substrates contain an 
N-terminal twin-arginine (SRRxFLK) motif serving as the targeting signal towards 
the translocon. Many Tat substrates have a system specific chaperone - redox
enzyme maturation protein (REMP) - for final folding and assembly prior to Tat
binding. The REMP DmsD strongly interacts with the twin-arginine motif of the
DmsA signal sequence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase. In this study, we
have utilized the in vitro protein-protein interaction technique of an affinity
pull down assay, as well as protein thermal stability measurement via
differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to investigate the interaction of
guanosine nucleotides (GNPs) with DmsD. Here we have shown highly cooperative
binding of DmsD with GTP. A dissociative ligand-binding style isotherm was
generated upon GTP titration into the DmsD:DmsAL interaction, yielding sigmoidal 
release of DmsD with a Hill coefficient of 2.09 and a dissociation constant of
0.99 mM. DSF further illustrated the change in thermal stability upon DmsD
interaction with DmsAL and GTP. These results imply the possibility of DmsD
detection and binding of GTP during the DMSO protein maturation mechanism, from
ribosomal translation to membrane targeting and final assembly. Conceivably, GTP 
is shown to act as a molecular regulator in the biochemical pathway.

Identification and Characterization of EDTA Test Strip Interfering Substances
Using a Digital Color Detector.

Scholes KL, Ence AT, Strathmann FG, Genzen JR.

BACKGROUND: Rapid test strips for ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) can be
used to verify correct specimen types for clinical assays which require, or
cannot be performed on, plasma collection tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant. As
the test strip reaction chemistry is based on a color change induced by chelation
of bismuth from a xylenol orange complex, we hypothesized that any agent capable 
of chelating bismuth might induce false positive test strip reactivity. The
present study was therefore designed to evaluate the potential for test strip
interference by chelating agents commonly used in the treatment of trace and
heavy metal toxicity.
METHODS: A digital color detector mounted on a 3D-printed test strip holder was
used to quantitatively assess test strip reactivity and evaluate
concentration-response relationships of eight commercially available chelating
agents.
RESULTS: This approach revealed the following rank-order potency: K2EDTA =
Na2EDTA > ethylene glycol tetra-acetic acid (EGTA) > dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) > 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) > penicillamine (PEN). Both
deferoxamine (DEF) and alpha lipoic acid (ALA) were non-reactive at 10 mM
concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS: These experiments demonstrate that multiple substances can induce
EDTA rapid test strip reactivity, but only at concentrations higher than might be
expected during therapeutic chelation therapy. These agents are therefore
unlikely to cause false positive results in routine clinical laboratory
specimens.

The identification of subtypes of known tumor markers is of great importance for 
clinical diagnosis but still a great challenge in novel detection methodologies
with simple operation and acceptable sensitivity. This work for the first time
reported a quantum dots (QDs) based potential-resolved electrochemiluminescent
(ECL) immunosensor to realize simultaneous detection of dual targets. Because of 
different surface microstructures, dimercaptosuccinic acid stabilized CdTe
(DMSA-CdTe) QDs and TiO2 nanoparticles-glutathione stabilized CdTe
(TiO2-GSH-CdTe) QDs composites showed a large difference of ECL peak potential
(∼360 mV), which provided an access for potential-resolution detection. The ECL
emission on indium tin oxide electrodes showed consistent strength during the
cyclic scan, and intensity data were collected at -0.89 V and -1.25 V (vs
Ag/AgCl) for DMSA-CdTe QDs and TiO2-GSH-CdTe QDs composites, respectively. The
interface modification procedures of immunosensor construction were characterized
by atomic force microscopy. The portion of Lens culinaris lectin affiliated
isoform of alpha fetoprotein (AFP), AFP-L3%, in total AFP, is recently a novel
criteria showing even higher sensitivity and specificity than AFP at the early
stage of cancer. Combined with the enzyme cyclic amplification strategy, linear
ranges for AFP-L3 and AFP dual-targets detection were 3.24 pg mL(-1)-32.4 ng
mL(-1) and 1.0 pg mL(-1)-20 ng mL(-1), with limits of detection of 3.24 pg mL(-1)
and 1.0 pg mL(-1), respectively. Compared with clinical detection data, the
calculated portion of AFP-L3% by as-prepared immunosensor showed acceptable
accuracy. These results open a new avenue for facile and rapid

The kidneys are one of the main dose-limiting organs in peptide receptor
radionuclide therapy and due to large inter-individual variations in renal
toxicity, biomarkers are urgently needed in order to optimize therapy and reduce 
renal tissue damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the
transcriptional, functional, and morphological effects on renal tissue after
177Lu-octreotate administration in normal mice, and to identify biomarkers for
radiation induced renal toxicity.METHODS: C57BL/6N mice were i.v. injected with
0, 30, 60, 90, 120, or 150 MBq 177Lu-octreotate (0, 16, 29, 40, 48, and 54 Gy to 
the kidneys). At 4, 8, and 12 months after administration, radiation-induced
effects were evaluated in relation to (a) global transcriptional variations in
kidney tissues, (b) morphological changes in the kidneys, (c) changes in white
and red blood cell count as well as blood levels of urea, and (d) changes in
renal function using 99mTc-DTPA/99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy.
RESULTS: In general, the highest number of differentially regulated transcripts
was observed at 12 months after administration. The Cdkn1a, C3, Dbp, Lcn2, and
Per2 genes displayed a distinct dose-dependent regulation, with increased
expression level with increasing absorbed dose. Ifng, Tnf, and Il1B were
identified as primary up-stream regulators of the recurrently regulated
transcripts. Furthermore, previously proposed biomarkers for kidney injury and
radiation damage were also observed. The functional investigation revealed
reduced excretion of 99mTc-DTPA after 150 MBq, an increased uptake of 99mTc-DMSA 
at all dose levels compared with the controls, and markedly increased urea level 
in blood after 150 MBq at 12 months.
CONCLUSION: Distinct dose-response relationships were found for several of the
regulated transcripts. The Cdkn1a, Dbp, Lcn2, and Per2 genes are proposed as
biomarkers for 177Lu-octreotate exposure of kidney. Correlations to functional
and morphological effects further confirm applicability of these genes as markers
of radiation damage in kidney tissue.

To understand pitfalls and limitations in adult renography, it is necessary to
understand firstly the physiology of the kidney, especially the magnitude and
control of renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and tubular fluid flow
rate, and secondly the pharmacokinetics and renal handling of the three most
often used tracers, Tc-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3), Tc-99m-diethylene
triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) and Tc-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The
kidneys may be imaged dynamically with Tc-99m-MAG3 or Tc-99m-DTPA, with or
without diuretic challenge, or by static imaging with Tc-99m-DMSA. Protocols are 
different according to whether the kidney is native or transplanted. Quantitative
analysis of dynamic data includes measurement of renal vascularity (important for
the transplanted kidney), absolute tracer clearance rates, differential renal
function (DRF) and response to diuretic challenge. Static image reveals
functional renal parenchymal damage, both focal and global, is useful in the
clinical management of obstructive uropathy, renal stone disease and hypertension
(under angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition), and is the preferred technique 
for determining DRF. Diagnosis based on morphological appearances is important in
transplant management. Even though nuclear medicine is now in the era of hybrid
imaging, renal imaging remains an important subspecialty in nuclear medicine and 
requires a sound basing in applied physiology, the classical supporting
discipline of nuclear medicine.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Selection of the appropriate radiologic investigation in a child
after first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) remains a contentious issue.
This report investigated the effectiveness of renal bladder ultrasound (RBUS) and
late 6 month dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in the detection of
high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) after first febrile UTI in infants aged
<1 year.
METHODS: A total of 387 infants aged <1 year with first febrile UTI who completed
diagnostic follow up consisting of RBUS, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and late
6 month DMSA scan were enrolled in the study. The effectiveness of RBUS and DMSA 
scan in the detection of high-grade VUR, including cost and benefit were
assessed.
RESULTS: Abnormal RBUS was identified in 95 infants (24.5%). VUR was identified
on VCUG in 79 (20.4%), of whom eight (2.1%) had high-grade VUR (grade IV-V).
Abnormal renal parenchyma was identified on late 6 month DMSA scan in 22 infants 
(5.7%). The sensitivity of abnormal RBUS and of late 6 month DMSA scan in the
prediction of high-grade VUR was 50% and 87.5%, and the proportion of infants who
avoided unnecessary VCUG was 75.5% and 94.3%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Fifty percent of high-grade VUR was not identified on RBUS screening
after first febrile UTI. Although late 6 month DMSA scan had higher sensitivity
in the detection of high-grade VUR, with the added benefit of detection of renal 
scars, the practical application of this method was limited due to its high cost,
radiation exposure and the associated delay in decision making.

Crossed renal ectopia is an uncommon developmental anomaly in which both kidneys 
are located on the same side of the body. The present case describes a
20-year-old man who underwent the military entrance physical examination. The
ultrasound showed the right kidney in normal site with slightly increased size,
but the left kidney was not identified. Tc-MAG3 scan showed a single kidney with 
2 ureters, and the orifices of the ureters were connected at both sides of
bladder. Tc-DMSA SPECT and contrast-enhanced multidetector CT were performed and 
revealed crossed fused renal ectopia.

BACKGROUND: Lead encephalopathy is a severe manifestation of lead poisoning that 
can present with altered mental status and seizures and has been associated with 
illicit moonshine consumption. Lead encephalopathy has traditionally been treated
using dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite, BAL) and calcium disodium
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CaNa2EDTA).
CASE REPORT: We describe a patient with lead encephalopathy related to
lead-contaminated moonshine consumption, who was treated using dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) due to a national shortage of CaNa2EDTA. A 66-year-old woman
presented to a hospital with headache, irritability, and altered mental status.
On hospital day 16, she was found to have a whole blood lead concentration of
148.2 μg/dL and a 24-h urine lead concentration of 232 μg/day. Due to a national 
shortage of CaNa2EDTA, the patient was given one dose of BAL and then started on 
DMSA via nasogastric tube. She dramatically improved over 4 days and was
subsequently transitioned to oral DMSA and outpatient treatment. One day prior to
discharge, her whole blood lead concentration was 47.2 μg/dL and her mental
status was normal. DMSA was used in lieu of CaNa2EDTA to treat the patient with
lead encephalopathy. The patient subsequently experienced clinical improvement
and declining whole blood level concentrations.
CONCLUSION: Further prospective studies are needed to compare the efficacy of
DMSA versus CaNa2EDTA in patients with lead encephalopathy.

Twelve organotins (methyl-, octyl-, butyl-, and phenyl-tin), and eight tin-free
antifouling paints and their degradation products were measured in marine
sediments from the Korean coastal area, and Busan and Ulsan bays, the largest
harbor area in Korea. The total concentration of tin-free antifouling paints was 
two- to threefold higher than the total concentration of organotins. Principal
component analysis was used to identify sites with relatively high levels of
contamination in the inner bay area of Busan and Ulsan bays, which were separated
from the coastal area. In Busan and Ulsan bays, chlorothalonil and DMSA were more
dominant than in the coastal area. However, Sea-Nine 211 and total diurons,
including their degradation products, were generally dominant in the Korean
coastal area. The concentrations of tin and tin-free compounds were significantly
different between the east and west coasts.

OBJECTIVE: Children with unilateral hydronephrosis are followed up with
anteroposterior pelvic diameter (APD), hydronephrosis grade,
mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG-3) drainage pattern and differential renal function
(DRF). Indeterminate drainage preserved DRF in higher grades of hydronephrosis,
in some situations, complicating the decision-making process. Due to an
asymmetric renal area ratio, falsely negative DRF estimations can result in
missed optimal surgery times. This study was designed to assess whether
correcting the DRF estimation according to kidney area could reflect the clinical
situation of a hydronephrotic kidney better than a classical DRF calculation,
concurrently with the hydronephrosis grade, APD and MAG-3 drainage pattern.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the MAG-3, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scans and ultrasonography (US) of 23 children (6 girls, 17 boys, mean age: 29 ±
50 months) with unilateral hydronephrosis. MAG-3 and DMSA scans were performed
within 3 months (mean 25.4 ± 30.7 days). The closest US findings (mean 41.5 ±
28.2 days) were used. DMSA DRF estimations were obtained using the geometric mean
method. Secondary calculations were performed to correct the counts (the total
counts divided by the number of pixels in ROI) according to kidney area. The
renogram patterns of patients were evaluated and separated into subgroups. The
visual assessment of DMSA scans was noted and the hydronephrotic kidney was
classified in comparison to the normal contralateral kidney's uptake. The
correlations of the DRF values of classical and area-corrected methods with MAG-3
renogram patterns, the visual classification of DMSA scan, the hydronephrosis
grade and the APD were assessed.
RESULTS: DRF estimations of two methods were statistically different (p: 0.001). 
The categories of 12 hydronephrotic kidneys were changed. There were no
correlations between classical DRF estimations and the hydronephrosis grade, APD,
visual classification of the DMSA scan and uptake evaluation. The DRF
distributions according to MAG-3 drainage patterns were not different.
Area-corrected DRF estimations correlated with all: with an increasing
hydronephrosis grade and APD, DRF estimations decreased and MAG-3 drainage
patterns worsened. A decrease in DRF (< 45 %) was determined when APD was ≥ 10
mm. When APD was ≥ 26 mm, a reduction of DRF below 40 % was determined.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that correcting DRF estimation for asymmetric
renal area ratio in unilateral hydronephrosis can be more robust than the
classical method, especially for higher grades of hydronephrotic kidneys, under
equivocal circumstances.

Periplasmic Export of Bile Salt Hydrolase in Escherichia coli by the
Twin-Arginine Signal Peptides.

Science & Technology, Tianjin, 300457, China.

Bile salt hydrolase (BSH, EC 3.5.1.24) is considered as an ideal way with lower
cost and less side effects to release the risk of coronary heart disease caused
by hypercholesterolemia. As bile salt hydrolase from Lactobacillus plantarum BBE7
could not be efficiently exported by PelB signal peptide of the general secretory
(Sec) pathway, three twin-arginine signal peptides from twin-arginine
translocation (Tat) pathway were synthesized, fused with bsh gene, inserted into 
expression vectors pET-20b(+) and pET-22b(+), and transformed into four different
Escherichia coli hosts, respectively. Among the 24 recombinant bacteria obtained,
E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (pET-20b(+)-dmsA-bsh) showed the highest BSH activity in
periplasmic fraction, which was further increased to 1.21 ± 0.03 U/mL by
orthogonal experimental design. And, signal peptide dimethyl sulfoxide reductase 
subunit DmsA (DMSA) had the best activity of exported BSH. More importantly, the 
presence of BSH in the periplasm had proven to be caused by the export rather
than cell leakage. For the first time, we report the periplasmic expression of
BSH by signal peptides from the Tat pathway. This will lay a solid foundation for
the purification and biochemical characterization of BSH from the supernatant,
and strategies adopted here could be used for the periplasmic expression of other
proteins in E. coli.

Fucopol, a fucose-containing exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by the bacterium
Enterobacter A47 DSM 23139 using glycerol as a carbon source, was employed as a
new coating material for iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). The coated
particles were assessed as nanoprobes for cell labeling by Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI). The MNPs were synthesized by a thermal decomposition method and
transferred to an aqueous medium by a ligand-exchange reaction with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). Covalent binding of EPS to
DMSA-stabilized nanoparticles (MNP-DMSA) resulted in a hybrid
magnetic-biopolymeric nanosystem (MNP-DMSA-EPS) with a hydrodynamic size of 170
nm, a negative surface charge under physiological conditions and transverse to
longitudinal relaxivity ratio, r2/r1, of 148. In vitro studies with two human
cell lines (colorectal carcinoma - HCT116 - and neural stem/progenitor cells -
ReNcell VM) showed that EPS promotes internalization of nanoparticles in both
cell lines. In vitro MRI cell phantoms showed a superior performance of
MNP-DMSA-EPS in ReNcell VM, for which the iron dose-dependent MRI signal drop was
obtained at relatively low iron concentrations (12-20 μg Fe per ml) and short
incubation times. Furthermore, ReNcell VM multipotency was not affected by
culture in the presence of MNP-DMSA or MNP-DMSA-EPS for 14 days. Our study
suggests that Fucopol-coated MNPs represent useful cell labeling nanoprobes for
MRI.

BACKGROUND: This study was designed to examine the capability of renal
ultrasonography (US) for predicting vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and renal
scarring (RS), and to assess, using initial US, the significant urologic
abnormalities that impact on management of children hospitalized with a first
febrile urinary tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: Hospitalized children aged ≤ 2 years with a first febrile UTI were
prospectively evaluated using imaging studies, including (99m)Tc
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, US, and voiding cystourethrography.
RESULTS: Of the 310 children analyzed (195 boys and 115 girls), 105 (33.9%) had
abnormal US. Acute DMSA scans were abnormal in 194 children (62.6%), including 89
(45.9%) with concomitant abnormal US. There was VUR in 107 children (34.5%),
including 79 (25.5%) with Grades III-V VUR. The sensitivity and negative
predictive values of US were 52.3% and 75.1%, respectively, for Grades I-V VUR
and 68.4% and 87.8%, respectively, for Grades III-V VUR. Eighty-five children
(27.4%) had RS, including 55 (64.7%) with abnormal US. Of the 105 children with
abnormal US, 33 (31.4%) needed subsequent management (surgical intervention,
parental counseling, or follow up of renal function). Nephromegaly on initial US 
and Grades III-V VUR were risk factors of RS.
CONCLUSION: Abnormal US may carry a higher probability of Grades III-V VUR and
RS, and can affect subsequent management in a significant number of children.
Nephromegaly on initial US and Grades III-V VUR are strongly associated with an
increased risk for RS. Thus, US should be performed on children after a first
febrile UTI and children with normal US may not require voiding
cystourethrography.

INTRODUCTION: Application of therapeutic folate radioconjugates is a promising
option for the treatment of folate receptor (FR)-positive tumors, although high
uptake of radiofolates in the kidneys remains a critical issue. Recently, it was 
shown that enhancing the blood circulation of radiofolates results in increased
tumor uptake and reduced retention of radioactivity in the kidneys. In this
study, we investigated and compared the anti-tumor effects and potential
long-term damage to the kidneys after application of an albumin-binding
((177)Lu-cm09), and a conventional ((177)Lu-EC0800) folate radioconjugate.
METHODS: In vivo studies were performed with KB tumor-bearing nude mice.
(177)Lu-EC0800 and (177)Lu-cm09 were applied at variable quantities (10-30
MBq/mouse), and the tumor growth was monitored over time. Mice without tumors
were injected with the same radiofolates and investigated over eight months by
determination of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen plasma levels and by
measuring renal uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA using SPECT. At the study end, the
morphological changes were examined on renal tissue sections using variable
staining methods.
RESULTS: Compared to untreated controls, dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition
and prolonged survival was observed in all treated mice. In line with the
resulting absorbed dose, the treatment was more effective with (177)Lu-cm09 than 
with (177)Lu-EC0800, enabling complete tumor remission after application of
≥20MBq (≥28Gy). Application of radiofolates with an absorbed renal dose ≥23 Gy
showed increased levels of renal plasma parameters and reduced renal uptake of
(99m)Tc-DSMA. Morphological changes observed on tissue sections confirmed
radionephropathy of variable stages.
CONCLUSIONS: (177)Lu-cm09 showed more favorable anti-tumor effects and
significantly less damage to the kidneys compared to (177)Lu-EC0800 as was
expected based on improved tumor-to-kidney ratios. It was demonstrated that
enhancing the blood circulation time of radiofolates was favorable regarding the 
risk-benefit profile of a therapeutic application. These results hold promise for
future translation of the albumin-binder concept to the clinics, potentially
enabling FR-targeted radionuclide therapy in patients.

PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the effect of dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA)-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide (γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA) bearing the
2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) ligand on targeting tumors with high-glucose metabolism.
PROCEDURES: γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA and 2-DG-conjugated γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA
(γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA-DG) were prepared. The glucose consumption of MDA-MB-231 and
MCF-7 breast cancer cells and human mammary epithelial cells (HMEpiCs) was
assessed. Cells were incubated with γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA or γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA-DG, and 
MDA-MB-231 cells which exhibited the highest glucose consumption were used in
breast cancer xenografts. Tumor targeting was studied by magnetic resonance
imaging and Prussian blue staining in vivo.
RESULTS: Glucose consumption was highest in MDA-MB-231 and lowest in HMEpiCs. In 
vitro, there was significant uptake of γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA-DG by MDA-MB-231 and
MCF-7 cells within 2 h and this was inhibited by glucose. Uptake of
γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA-DG was significantly higher in MDA-MB-231 compared with MCF-7
cells, and there was no obvious uptake of γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA in either cell line.
In vivo, γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA-DG could be detected in the liver and in tumors
post-injection, while γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA was nearly undetectable in tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: 2-DG-coated γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA improved tumor targeting of
γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA which can be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging.

BACKGROUND: Magnetic Nanoparticles (MNP) have been used for contrast enhancement 
in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In recent years, research on the use of
ferrite nanoparticles in T2 contrast agents has shown a great potential
application in MR imaging. In this work, Co0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 and Co0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4-DMSA
magnetic nanoparticles, CZF-MNPs and CZF-MNPs-DMSA, were investigated as MR
imaging contrast agents.
METHODS: Cobalt zinc ferrite nanoparticles and their suitable coating, DMSA, were
investigated under in vitro condition. Human prostate cancer cell lines (DU145
and PC3) with bare (uncoated) and coated magnetic nanoparticles were investigated
as nano-contrast MR imaging agents.
RESULTS: Using T2-weighted MR images identified that signal intensity of bare and
coated MNPs was enhanced with increasing concentration of MNPs in water. The
values of 1/T2 relaxivity (r2) for bare and coated MNPs were found to be 88.46
and 28.80 (mM (-1) s(-1)), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results show that bare and coated MNPs are suitable as
T2-weighted MR imaging contrast agents. Also, the obtained r2/r1 values (59.3 and
50) for bare and coated MNPs were in agreement with the results of other previous
relevant works.

Hydronephrosis is a common finding in urinary tract outflow obstruction.
Chronically obstructed hydronephrotic system may be associated with parenchymal
changes. Ultrasound, intravenous urography, micturating cysto-urethrogram and
scintigraphy are commonly performed to evaluate the cause of obstruction. In
childhood, pelviureteric junction obstruction is a common cause of the
hydronephrosis. Hydronephrosis can also be present in horseshoe kidneys due to
poor drainage. However, a large sized hydronephrotic cavity may obscure the
finding of horseshoe kidney. A case was reported, and it was diagnosed as
horseshoe kidney on follow-up renal dynamic scan and confirmed with the help of
dimercaptosuccinic acid SPECT/CT.

Chelation for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

James S(1), Stevenson SW, Silove N, Williams K.

Author information:

16th Street, Phoenix, AZ, USA.

BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that the severity of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) symptoms is positively correlated with the level of circulating or stored
toxic metals, and that excretion of these heavy metals, brought about by the use 
of pharmaceutical chelating agents, results in improved symptoms.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential benefits and adverse effects of
pharmaceutical chelating agents (referred to as chelation therapy throughout this
review) for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases on 6 November 2014: CENTRAL, 
Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to
Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and 15 other databases, including
three trials registers. In addition we checked references lists and contacted
experts.
SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials of pharmaceutical chelating 
agents compared with placebo in individuals with ASD.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, 
assessed them for risk of bias and extracted relevant data. We did not conduct a 
meta-analysis, as only one study was included.
MAIN RESULTS: We excluded nine studies because they were non-randomised trials or
were withdrawn before enrolment. We included one study, which was conducted in
two phases. During the first phase of the study, 77 children with ASD were
randomly assigned to receive seven days of glutathione lotion or placebo lotion, 
followed by three days of oral dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). Forty-nine
children who were found to be high excreters of heavy metals during phase one
continued on to phase two to receive three days of oral DMSA or placebo followed 
by 11 days off, with the cycle repeated up to six times. The second phase thus
assessed the effectiveness of multiple doses of oral DMSA compared with placebo
in children who were high excreters of heavy metals and who received a three-day 
course of oral DMSA. Overall, no evidence suggests that multiple rounds of oral
DMSA had an effect on ASD symptoms.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review included data from only one study, which had
methodological limitations. As such, no clinical trial evidence was found to
suggest that pharmaceutical chelation is an effective intervention for ASD. Given
prior reports of serious adverse events, such as hypocalcaemia, renal impairment 
and reported death, the risks of using chelation for ASD currently outweigh
proven benefits. Before further trials are conducted, evidence that supports a
causal link between heavy metals and autism and methods that ensure the safety of
participants are needed.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary
care centre in Puducherry, south India, with the aim of finding the profile of
the paediatric urinary tract infection (UTI), bacterial pathogens involved, and
also to observe vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and renal scarring in these patients.
METHODS: A total of 524 paediatric patients ≤13 yr, suspected to have UTI, were
included in the study. Urine samples were collected, processed for uropathogen
isolation and antibiotic susceptibility test was performed as per the Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Thirty two culture proven
children with UTI underwent micturating cysto-urethrography (MCU) and
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning was done for 69 children.
RESULTS: o0 f the 524 children, 186 (35.4%) had culture proven UTI with 105
(56.4%) being infants, 50 (27.4%) between 1-5 yr, 30 (16.12%) between 5-13 yr and
129 (69.35%) males. Posterior urethral valve (PUV) was noted in three,
hydronephrosis in one, VUR in 18 and renal scarring in 33. VUR as well as renal
scarring were more in males >1 yr of age. A significant association (P=0.0054)
was noted with a combined sensitivity and specificity of these investigations
being 83 and 90 per cent, respectively of the MCU and DMSA scans for detecting
VUR. Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen isolated, sensitive to
nitrofurantoin, followed by cefoperazone-sulbactam, aminoglycosides and
meropenem.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that UTI varies with age and
gender and extensive evaluation is required in boys over one year of age with
UTI. This study also highlights the better efficacy of aminoglycosides,
cefoperazone-sulbactam and nitrofurantoin in vitro compared with meropenem in
Gram-negative uropathogens.

The objectives of this study are to prepare sulfhydryl-modified Fe3O4@SiO2
core/shell magnetic nanocomposites, assess their toxicity in vitro, and explore
their potential application in the biomedical fields. Fe3O4 nanoparticles
synthesized by facile solvothermal method were coated with SiO2 via the Stöber
method and further modified by the meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) to
prepare Fe3O4@SiO2@DMSA nanoparticles. The morphology, structure, functional
groups, surface charge, and magnetic susceptibility of the nanoparticles were
characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier
transform infrared spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, zeta potential
analysis, dynamic laser scattering, and vibrating sample magnetometer.
Cytotoxicity tests and hemolysis assay were also carried out. Experimental
results show that the toxicity of sulfhydryl-modified Fe3O4@SiO2 core/shell
nanoparticles in mouse fibroblast (L-929) cell lines is between grade 0 and grade
1, and the material lacks hemolytic activity, indicating good biocompatibility of
this Fe3O4@SiO2@DMSA nanocomposite, which is suitable for further application in 
biochemical fields.

We studied the effect of silymarin and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), a
chelating agent that was administered individually or in combination against lead
(Pb) toxicity in rats. Wistar rats (200 ± 20) were randomly divided into five
groups. Group A served as a control. Groups B-E were exposed to 2000 ppm of lead 
acetate in drinking water for 8 weeks. Group B served as a positive control.
Group C received silymarin (100 mg kg(-1) orally) for 8 weeks. Group D received
DMSA (75 mg kg(-1) orally) once daily for the last 5 days of treatment. Group E
received DMSA and silymarin as groups C and D, respectively. The effect of Pb was
evaluated and accordingly the treatments on blood lead levels (BLLs), renal
system, and genotoxic effects were calculated using comet assay. The BLLs were
significantly increased following the exposition of lead acetate. The
administration of silymarin and DMSA provided reduction in BLLs. Silymarin and
DMSA provided significant protection on the genotoxic effect of Pb. The toxic
effect of Pb on kidneys was also studied. Our data suggest that silymarin and
DMSA improve the renal histopathological lesions.

BACKGROUND: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a multisystem genetic disorder
characterized with central obesity, pigmentary retinopathy, polydactyly, mental
retardation, and hypogenitalism. Renal abnormalities have been recognized as a
cardinal feature of the disease with serious prognostic implication. The aim of
this study was to analyze the renal status in children with BBS and to implement 
appropriate interventions in those with progressive course Patients and methods: 
The diagnosis of BBS was established on the basis of criteria proposed by Beales 
et al. (J Med Genet 1999). Imaging of the kidneys and urinary tract was performed
with ultrasound study, Tc99(m)DMSA scan and a cystographic study. Twenty four
hour urine collections were obtained for estimation of proteinuria and creatinine
clearance. Blood pressure was monitored at clinical visits or as 24-hour
ambulatory monitoring.
RESULTS: There were 4 children (2 males, 2 females). All four children displayed 
abnormal kidney ultrasound and Tc99(m)DMSA scan resembling dysplastic kidney(s). 
Two of them had overt proteinuria (glomerulo-tubular pattern). Three children had
normal blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate (GFR): 107, 145 and 95
ml/min/1.73m(2), and the fourth had hypertension and progressive worsening of the
GFR at 65 ml/min/1.73m(2).
CONCLUSION: Children with BBS should undergo imaging studies of the kidneys and
urinary tract at initial work up; in those with renal dysplasia proteinuria, GFR 
and blood pressure should be regularly monitored to slow down progression to
terminal renal failure.

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is one of the most important causes of urinary tract 
infection and renal failure in children. It is a potentially self-limited
disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical course and
significant factors in children with primary VUR. The medical charts of 125
infants and children (27.2 % males, 72.8% females) with all grades of primary VUR
were retrospectively reviewed. Mean age at diagnosis was 22.3 ± 22.9 months. 52% 
of patients had bilateral VUR. Mild reflux (Grade I, II) was the most common
initial grade. 53.6% of patients achieved spontaneous resolution. 30.1% of
patients had decreased renal function on initial DMSA renal scan, significantly
in males and severe VUR. Reflux nephropathy occurred in 17.6% of patients,
especially in renal damage and male sex. No significant association was observed 
between recurrent urinary tract infection with the severity of VUR, and the
presence of renal damage at admission. Age at diagnosis, gender, grade,
laterality, the absence of recurrent urinary tract infection and renal damage had
a significant correlation between spontaneous VUR resolution. Spontaneous
resolution of primary VUR occurred significantly in female patients, age ≤ 30
months at diagnosis, mild-to-moderate VUR, unilateral reflux, the absence of
recurrent urinary tract infection, and renal damage.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) on
global and regional renal function in children.
METHODS: In total, 40 children (41 renal units) undergoing PNL were included in
this prospective study. All patients were evaluated using quantitative
single-photon emission computed tomography (QSPECT) with
technetium-99 m-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) examinations before and 3 
months after surgery.
RESULTS: The mean age was 9.5 years (range, 3-16), and the mean stone size was
3.4 cm (range, 2-6.5). Of the cases, 39 (95%) were managed as being stone-free
after a single session of PNL. After additional treatment procedures, 40 (97.5%) 
of the cases were managed as being stone-free. Of the 41 renal units, new focal
cortical defects on (99m)Tc-DMSA scans were seen in 4 (9.7%) patients. Total
relative uptake in the treated kidneys increased from 42.3% to 44.1%. The mean
creatinine level before PNL was 1.18 ± 0.45 (0.8-1.6) mg/dL compared with 1.16
(0.7-1.5) mg/dL by the end of the follow-up period (not statistically
significantly different, p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: PNL in children is a safe and feasible method for the maximal
clearance of stones. QSPECT of (99m)Tc-DMSA confirmed that renal function is
preserved or even improved after percutaneous stone removal.

Recent diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to prenatally and perinatally
diagnosed hydronephrosis and their implementation in the University Clinical
Hospital Mostar.

Mandić V, Martinović V, Kvesić A, Bukvić N, Skitarelić N, Brekalo Z, Ivanković K,
Šetka V.

A shift of the diagnostics of urological malformations towards the fetal age by
means of ultrasound, especially hydronephrosis which, apart from reflux, is the
most frequent developmental urological disorder, opened many dilemmas and
debates. In the course of more than three decades the application of this
diagnostic approach to the problem of hydrone- phrosis became a routine clinical 
practice in all modern clinics. In this paper we present the problems related to 
this diagnostic method and its delayed application in the Mostar University
Clinical Hospital. Along with the exposition of a general approach to the problem
of hydronephrosis we briefly present our modest collection of cases which points 
to the most recent trend of a vigorous medical development in this region,
despite unfavorable overall conditions which prevailed so far. The observation
included 56 children with prenatal, perinatal and early age determination of
pyelon dilatation by means of ultrasonic exploration who were treated surgically.
Of this number 32 (57.14%) were male, and 24 (42.86%) female children. Of the
observed patients 56 had unilateral and 6 had bilateral pyelon dilatation so that
62 kidneys in all were observed and treated. The dilatation was determined
prenatally in 24 (38.7%) out of 62 kidneys observed in all, in 7 (11.29%) the
disorder was observed perinatally and in remaining 31 cases (49.9%) it manifested
during early childhood, school age, even at the age of pre-puberty. Of the
children with prenatally and perinatally determined dilatation, in 14 (45.16%)
out of 31 (100.0%) observed kidneys the ap radius of the dilated pyelon was
between 10-15 mm, and in 17 (54.84%) more than 15 mm. Along with other
examinations (MAG3 and DMSA) the patients were followed-up by ultrasonic
exploration of the observed kidney for 6 to 30 (average 18) months after
postnatal diagnosis; the ultrasonic exploration was repeated in intervals of 6
months. Within 12 months of birth surgical intervention on the pyeloureteral
junction was done on all 17 kidneys with an ap radius of the pyelon greater than 
15 mm, as well as on 4 kidneys in which ap radius was between 10 and 15 mm. In
other 10 kidneys with prenatally and perinatally determined ap radius of 10 to 15
mm the follow-up period was 25 to 30 months (average 275). As the examinations
(ultrasound, MAG3 and DMSA) even after this period showed no signs of regression 
of the dilatation, nor an improvement in patency this provided an indication for 
surgical intervention with the aim of establishing a normal flow across the
pyeloureteral junction. Antibiotic prophylaxis was not applied systematically,
but in a targeted manner if the uroinfection was confirmed clinically and in the 
lab. Through the presentation of cases we demonstrate the relationship of earlier
and more recent procedures in the treatment of hydronephrosis in the
gravitational area of the Mostar University Clinical Hospital. The fact that some
children were subjected to surgical treatment due to hydronephrosis at the time
of pre-puberty reflects earlier views on this clinical entity. The successfulness
of surgical treatment of hydronephrosis in the observed patients is complete and 
comparable to medically more developed environments, and our diagnostic
capabilities are getting close to that level too. We specially wish to stress the
recent introduction of ultrasonic examination of pregnant women and foetus in the
third trimester with the aim of an early detection of anomalies and malformations
of the urotract as an indicator of a marked medical devel- opment. On the global 
level there are still inconclusive and opposing opinions on this subject, as is
seen in recent literature. The controversies relate to the diagnostics as well as
to therapy.

The purpose of this study was to determine the potential benefits of combination 
therapy using dimercaptosuccinic acid modified iron oxide (DMSA-Fe3O4) magnetic
nanoparticles (MNPs) combined with nontoxic concentration of bortezomib (BTZ) and
gambogic acid (GA) on multiple myeloma (MM) RPMI-8226 cells and possible
underlying mechanisms. The effects of BTZ-GA-loaded MNP-Fe3O4 (BTZ-GA/MNPs) on
cell proliferation were assessed by the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,4,-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. Cell 
cycle and apoptosis were detected using the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl
transferase (TdT)-mediated biotin-16-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay and
flow cytometry (FCM). Furthermore, DMSA-Fe3O4 MNPs were characterized in terms of
distribution, apoptotic morphology, and cellular uptake by transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Subsequently, 
the effect of BTZ-GA/MNPs combination on PI3K/Akt activation and
apoptotic-related protein were appraised by Western blotting. MTT assay and
hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining were applied to elevate the functions of
BTZ-GA/MNPs combination on the tumor xenograft model and tumor necrosis. The
results of this study revealed that the majority of MNPs were quasi-spherical and
the MNPs taken up by cells were located in the endosome vesicles of cytoplasm.
Nontoxic concentration of BTZ-GA/MNPs increased G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and 
induced apoptosis in RPMI-8226 cells. Furthermore, the combination of BTZ-GA/MNPs
activated phosphorylated Akt levels, Caspase-3, and Bax expression, and
down-regulated the PI3K and Bcl-2 levels significantly. Meanwhile, the in vivo
tumor xenograft model indicated that the treatment of BTZ-GA/MNPs decreased the
tumor growth and volume and induced cell apoptosis and necrosis. These findings
suggest that chemotherapeutic agents polymerized MNPs-Fe3O4 with GA could serve
as a better alternative for targeted therapeutic approaches to treat multiple
myeloma.

BACKGROUND: Mortality in the first year of maintenance dialysis is higher than in
subsequent years and, within this first year, the risk of death is highest in the
first 90 days. Some studies have shown that pre-dialysis education reduces early 
mortality. Limited data have been published from South Africa regarding early
mortality after commencement of maintenance dialysis treatment and the effect of 
pre-dialysis intervention programmes on these outcomes. The aim of this study was
to assess the impact of a pre-dialysis intervention programme on 90- and 365-day 
outcomes and to determine incident mortality in a population of chronic haemo-
and peritoneal dialysis patients in South Africa.
METHODS: This study used a retrospective cohort of 269 patients who received a
pre-dialysis intervention [Healthy Start (HS)] and a matched group of 269
patients who did not receive the intervention. Both groups subsequently commenced
maintenance haemo-/peritoneal dialysis with National Renal Care (NRC). A
between-group comparative analysis was conducted to determine whether there were 
any differences in morbidity and mortality at 90 and 365 days of chronic dialysis
treatment. Survival curves for the first 365 days of treatment were calculated
using the Kaplan-Meier estimation for the entire population and by age group,
gender, race, diabetes, dialysis modality and presence of a central venous
catheter (CVC) at start of dialysis treatment.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the HS and non-HS groups
at 90 and 365 days when comparing mortality, cause of death, hospital admission
rates and length of stay. Data were then pooled and a Kaplan-Meier analysis
showed 90- and 365-day survival of 96.7 and 85.6%, respectively. The peak
mortality occurred at 150 days of dialysis treatment, but this was not
significant. Older age and the presence of a CVC were associated with an
increased risk of death in the first year of treatment.
CONCLUSION: The HS Programme made no difference to mortality in the first year of
chronic dialysis. Early survival for both HS and non-HS groups was excellent when
compared to international data. Increasing age and the presence of a CVC at the
start of chronic dialysis were the two factors that impacted significantly on
1-year survival.

OBJECTIVE: In a historical cohort of children with a urinary tract infection
(UTI) who had already undergone all the imaging procedures, the aim was to
determine renal tract abnormalities which would have been missed had we
implemented the new guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence in the United Kingdom (NICE) or the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: After a UTI episode, forty-three children (28 females, 65%)
aged between 2 months and 2 years presenting at two general hospitals with a
febrile UTI before 2008 underwent all the recommended imaging studies predating
the new guidelines. Hydronephrosis was defined and graded according to the
Society for Fetal Urology (SFU) classification. Hydronephrosis grade II (mild
pelvicalyceal dilatation), grade III (moderate dilatation), and grade IV (gross
dilatation with thinning of the renal cortex), duplication, vesicoureteral reflux
(VUR) grade II and above, renal scarring and reduced renal uptake (<45%) on
technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy were
considered significant abnormalities. We calculated the proportion of
abnormalities which would have been missed had the new guidelines been used
instead.
RESULTS: The median of age was 7.6 months (mean 8.7, range 2-24 months), with the
majority (n = 37, 86%) being under 1 year of age. Ultrasound (US) showed
hydronephrosis in 14 (32%), all grade II. A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) was
performed in all and showed VUR ≥ grade II in 16 (37%), including eight children 
(19%) where it was bilateral. DMSA scan showed scarring in 25 children (58%) of
whom 11 (26%) had bilateral scars. Reduced differential renal uptake was present 
in 10 children (23%). Of the 29 children with normal US, 18 (62%) had renal
scarring and nine (31%) had VUR ≥ grade II. The NICE guidelines would have missed
63% of the children with VUR ≥ grade II, including a high proportion of grades IV
and V VUR, 44% of the children with renal scarring, and 20% of the children with 
decreased renal uptake, including some children with bilateral renal scarring and
with decreased renal uptake. The AAP guidelines would have missed 56% of the
children with VUR ≥ grade II, including a high proportion of grades IV and V VUR,
and all children with renal scarring as well as those with decreased renal
uptake.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of renal tract abnormalities missed by the new
guidelines is high. They should be used with full awareness of their limitations.

BACKGROUND: Rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque is the primary cause of acute
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular syndromes. Early and non-invasive detection of
vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques (VP) would be significant in preventing some
aspects of these syndromes. As a new contrast agent, dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) modified ultra-small super paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) was synthesized
and used to identify VP and rupture plaque by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: Atherosclerosis was induced in male New Zealand White rabbits by feeding
a high cholesterol diet (n = 30). Group A with atherosclerosis plaque (n = 10)
were controls. VP was established in groups B (n = 10) and C (n = 10) using
balloon-induced endothelial injury of the abdominal aorta. Adenovirus-carrying
p53 genes were injected into the aortic segments rich in plaques after 8 weeks.
Group C was treated with atorvastatin for 8 weeks. Sixteen weeks later, all
rabbits underwent pharmacological triggering, and imaging were taken daily for 5 
d after DMSA-USPIO infusion. At the first day and before being killed, serum
MMP-9, sCD40L, and other lipid indicators were measured.
RESULTS: DMSA-USPIO particles accumulated in VP and rupture plaques. Rupture
plaques appeared as areas of hyper-intensity on DMSA-USPIO enhanced MRI,
especially T2*-weighted sequences, with a signal strength peaking at 96 h. The
group given atorvastatin showed few DMSA-USPIO particles and had lower levels of 
serum indicators. MMP-9 and sCD40L levels in group B were significantly higher
than in the other 2 groups (P <0.05).
CONCLUSION: After successfully establishing a VP model in rabbits, DMSA-USPIO was
used to enhance MRI for clear identification of plaque inflammation and rupture. 
Rupture plaques were detectable in this way probably due to an activating
inflammatory process. Atorvastatin reduced the inflammatory response and
stabilizing VP possibly by decreasing MMP-9 and sCD40L levels.

In this study, lead acetate solution and porcine cerebral hydrolysate peptides
(PCHPs) were administered to developing mice. Porcine cerebral protein pretreated
by ultrasound was hydrolyzed with alcalase, and 11 peptide fragments were
obtained by Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis of PCHPs. Our data showed that PCHPs
significantly decreased Pb2+-induced spontaneous locomotor activity, latencies to
reach the platform, and the time in target quadrant. It also decreased the
accumulation of lead in the blood and brain of Pb2+-exposed developing mice.
Co-administration of PCHPs and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) did not only reduce
the accumulation of lead in blood but also increased the absorption of zinc and
iron in Pb2+-exposed mice. Administration of PCHPs individually significantly
enhanced hematopoietic parameters compared with the Pb2+-exposed group. PCHPs
significantly reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
malondialdehyde (MDA) but increased glutathione (GSH) content and anti-oxidant
enzymes and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities in Pb2+-exposed brain. Our
findings suggest that PCHPs have the ability to protect against Pb2+-exposed
learning and memory deficits and oxidative damage.

Lead poisoning has been known as an important disorder that affects individuals
through acute, sub-acute and chronic exposure in environmental and occupational
settings. This study was conducted to compare the curative role of garlic
combined with silymarin versus dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in decreasing lead 
induced nephrotoxicity in adult male albino rats. The period of lead intoxication
extended for 3 months followed by either 1 month treatment with garlic and
silymarin or 5 days treatment with DMSA. Lead poisoning caused non-significant
difference in kidney function tests (BUN and serum creatinine) while, it caused
significant elevation in kidney lead level, significant decrease in renal
antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase and significant elevation in kidney
malondialdehyde. Histologically, lead induced disorganization and shrinkage of
glomeruli with sloughing and vaculation of epithelium, widening of Bowman's space
and inflammatory infiltration in renal medulla. Treatment by garlic extract
combined with silymarin as well as treatment with DMSA resulted in significant
improvement in the affected parameters. Also, both methods of treatment resulted 
in improvement of the histopathological changes. It can be concluded that garlic 
extract combined to silymarin is comparable to DMSA in amelioration of lead
induced nephrotoxicity.

BACKGROUND: Pathogenesis of renal parenchymal scarring (RPS) after acute
pyelonephritis (APN) is unclear. The risk of RPS varies markedly among
individuals, suggesting a genetic role.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate a possible role of common polymorphisms in renin
angiotensin system genes in APN-associated RPS in children.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 104 APN children and 300 controls. APN 
was diagnosed by urine culture and typical findings on 99Tc-DMSA scans. Voiding
cystourethrogram tested the presence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Follow-up
DMSA scans were performed 4-6 months later to identify new RPS. Angiotensin
converting enzyme gene I/D, angiotensin II receptor type-1 A1166C and
angiotensinogen M235T polymorphisms were genotyped.
RESULTS: New RPS developed in 44.2% (46/104) of children with APN. VUR was
diagnosed in 35.6% (37/104) of APN cases. RPS developed in 73% of cases of VUR.
The D allele of ACE gene I/D polymorphism was significantly more common in APN
cases with RPS (73.91%) than non-RPS (58.6%) and controls (54.5%) (p = 0.021, p =
0.002, respectively). The AGTR-1 A1166C A allele was significantly more common in
VUR than the non-reflux children (91.9% versus 76.1%; p = 0.005). VUR, in
contrast to the D allele (OR 6.1, 95% CI 0.878-19.7; p = 0.05), was an
independent risk factor for RPS.
DISCUSSION: ACE gene D allele is associated with a twofold increase in RPS risk, 
which could be a result of a functional effect to increase tissue levels and
activity of ACE during APN. However, D allele failed to qualify as an independent
risk and its RPS association could be dependent on other co-factors, such as
TGFβ1 activation, or the D-allele might link with recently discovered functional 
polymorphisms at the 5' end of the ACE gene. Although VUR is an independent risk 
for RPS, it is not clear whether this is due to exposure of the kidneys to
infected urine, or VUR-associated dysplasia. In contrast with published
literature, we noted higher rates of RPS and high-grade VUR, suggesting a more
aggressive VUR course or local unawareness of APN. Our study has its limitations;
the small number of VUR children, and the clinical and ethical difficulties of
testing VCUG and DMSA in controls.
CONCLUSIONS: ACE gene D allele is associated with, but cannot independently
predict, RPS in children. VUR is an independent risk for post-pyelonephritic
scarring. AGTR-1 1166A/C polymorphism is associated with occurrence, but not
progression, of VUR.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this prospective study were to assess the relationship
between tumor aggressiveness and Tc-99m (V) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake
in chondrogenic bone tumors and the value of Tc-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy for
differentiating benign from malignant tumors.
METHODS: Twenty-four patients with chondrogenic tumors (19 benign and five
malignant) underwent Tc-99m DMSA (V) scintigraphy. Radiopharmaceutical uptake was
classified using a three-point scale to allow a visual-only analysis, and a
tumor-to-background contrast (TBC) was computed using regions of interest to
provide a semiquantitative analysis. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used 
to assess the correlation between tumor aggressiveness and TBC. The difference in
TBC between benign and malignant tumors was analyzed with the Mann-Whitney
U-test. An appropriate cutoff value of TBC was chosen for the diagnosis of
malignancy of a tumor using receiver operating characteristic analysis.
RESULTS: Six benign tumors showed negative uptake (uptake score 0), whereas 13
benign tumors showed positive uptake (n=10 uptake score 1; n=3 uptake score 2).
All chondrosarcomas showed positive uptake (n=2 uptake score 1; n=3 uptake score 
2). A significant correlation was found between tumor aggressiveness and TBC. A
significant difference was seen in TBC between benign and malignant tumors. With 
the chosen cutoff value of TBC equal to 0.611, the sensitivity was 80.0%,
specificity was 78.9%, the positive predictive value was 50.0%, and the negative 
predictive value was 93.8%.
CONCLUSION: Tc-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy may have the potential to improve
diagnostic methods for detecting chondrosarcomas using visual and/or
semiquantitative analyses.

BACKGROUND: It is crucial to preserve the renal parenchyma in a solitary
renoureteric system, especially when associated with VUR and/or elevated bladder 
pressures.
AIM: The present study examined the effect of retaining the refluxing lower
ureteral stump of a non-functioning renal unit (during nephrectomy) as a stoma to
preserve contralateral renal function.
STUDY DESIGN: Twelve children with various uropathologies (six with PUV, three
with primary VUR, and three with neurogenic bladder) and a solitary functioning
kidney were retrospectively analysed. In each, besides the relevant
investigations and specific management, nephrectomy was performed for a
non-functioning kidney with recurrent UTI (10/12) or hypertension (2/12), and the
ipsilateral distal ureteric stump was exteriorised as a refluxing stoma.
Antimicrobial prophylaxis was given to those with VUR into the solitary kidney
(9/12). All were on strict follow-up at a dedicated paediatric nephrourology
clinic with serial clinical, biochemical and radiological surveillance.
RESULTS: The mean age at presentation and surgery was 19.7 months (range 0.5-96) 
and 30.5 months (range 3-100), respectively. Recurrent UTI (10/12) and acute
renal failure (8/12) were common presentations; 2/12 were hypertensive. The
initial serum creatinine ranged from 0.3 to 7.2 (mean 2.3) mg/dl. Of the solitary
functioning kidneys with VUR (9/12), seven had Grade 5 VUR and six had renal
cortical scars. The stoma served as an intermittent vent (9/12), for CIC (4/12)
or for both purposes (3/12). Although all were Grade 5 refluxing ureters, 3/12
stomas remained dry. At a mean follow-up of 30 months (12-48), 9/12 were well and
3/12 were in end-stage renal disease. None had a UTI after the procedure. VUR
resolved in five ureters that sub-served the contralateral solitary kidney.
Serial DMSA renal cortical scans showed no scarring in four children,
non-progressive scars in three and new scars in two. At the last follow-up, four 
(one dry, three leaking) were being used for CIC, four (one dry, three leaking)
had been closed and four (one dry, three leaking) were retained until resolution 
of contralateral reflux/non-progression of scarring (three) or for possible CIC
in the future (one).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Retaining the refluxing lower ureteral stump of a
non-functioning kidney as a cutaneous stoma provided a vent and an alternative
channel for CIC of the bladder (Figure). Subsequently, fewer UTI seemed to
protect the contralateral solitary functioning kidney, particularly in those with
associated VUR. In this preliminary study, the procedure was simple and the stoma
was well accepted by patients and parents.

Salmon myofibrillar protein (Mf) was investigated as a source of edible
anti-inflammatory products. Peptides produced by stepwise digestion of Mf
(without carbohydrate) with pepsin and trypsin had little effect on the secretion
of inflammation-related compounds from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7
macrophage cells. However, peptides prepared from Mf conjugated with alginate
oligosaccharide (AO; 19 μg/mg protein) (dMSA) through the Maillard reaction in
the presence of sorbitol significantly reduced the secretion of the
pro-inflammatory mediators nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and
interleukin (IL)-6, as well as mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, inducible nitric
oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2. Additionally, dMSA inhibited acute
inflammation in a carrageenan-induced model of paw edema in mice, but had no
effect on natural killer cell cytotoxic activity or macrophage phagocytosis.
These results suggest that fish Mf conjugated with AO may be a potential food
material with anti-inflammatory function.

[Chemical characteristics of Nickel(II) 2,3-dimercaptosuccinate complexes
modified on gold electrodes].

[Article in Chinese]

Liu WH, Yuan RH, Teng YJ.

2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and its complex Nickel(II)
2,3-Dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA-Ni(II)) were assembled on the electrochemically
activated Au electrode and the modified films were investigated by ex-situ SERS, 
SEM and electro-reduction. The coordination ratio (1:2) and stability constant
(4.716 X 10(7)) of DMSA and Nickel(II) were firstly confirmed by UV. Then, the
SERS spectra showed that DMSA was absorbed on the surface of activated Au and the
coordinate bond of DMSA-Ni(II) was existed as S-Ni-O. Meanwhile, two reduction
peaks of DMSA-Ni(II) on Au electrode were presented at negative potential. The
first peak (from positive to negative values) was related to the RS-Au group
which was produced by the mutual absorption of DMSA and Au. The second reduction 
peak was related to Nickel(II). Finally, it was further confirmed by calculating 
the surface coverage and comparison of molecular area. And it was found that the 
molecular arrangement of DM-SA-Ni(II) on Au electrode generated as monolayer
which was dispersed or connected partly instead of concentrated or overlapped.

INTRODUCTION: Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that functions as an
antioxidant. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamins E
supplementation in combination with antibiotics for the treatment of girls with
acute pyelonephritis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This double-blinded randomized controlled trial was
conducted on 152 girls aged 5 to 12 years with a first acute pyelonephritis
episode based on technetium Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA). They
were randomized to receive a 14-day treatment with only antibiotics (control
group; n = 76) and 14-day treatment with supplements of vitamin E (intervention
group; n = 76) in addition to the antibiotics. Patients' clinical symptoms were
monitored for 14 days and urine culture was performed 3 to 4 days and 7 to 10
days after the start of the treatment and its completion, respectively. All of
the girls once underwent DMSA scan 4 to 6 months after the treatment.
RESULTS: During the follow-up days, the mean frequency of fever (P = .01),
urinary frequency (P = .001), urgency (P = .003), dribbling (P = .001), and
urinary incontinence (P = .006) were significantly lower in the intervention
group compared to the control group. There was no significant difference in the
results of urine culture 3 to 4 days after the start of treatment (P = .16) and 7
to 10 days after its termination (P = .37). There was also no significant
difference between the results of DMSA scan 4 to 6 months after the start of
treatment (P = .31).
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin E supplementation has a significant effect in ameliorating
sign and symptoms of UTI. However, further studies are recommended to confirm
these findings.

[Contemporary nuclear medicine diagnostics of neuroendocrine tumors].

[Article in Serbian]

[No authors listed]

The new positron emission tomography (PET/CT) methods for neuroendocrine tumors
detection are presented and compared with classic, conventional methods.
Conventional methods use a gamma scintillation camera for patients with
neuroendocrine tumor imaging, after intravenous injection of one of the following
radiopharmaceuticals: 1) somatostatin analogues labeled with indium-111
(111In-pentetreotide) or technetium-99m (99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC); 2) noradrenaline 
analogue labeled with iodine-131 or -123 (131/123I-MIBG); or 3) 99mTc(V)-DMSA.
Contemporary methods use PET/CT equipment for patients with neuroendocrine tumor 
imaging, after intravenous injection of pharmaceuticals labeled with positron
emitters [fluorine-18 (18F), galium-68 (68Ga), or carbon-11 (11C)]: 1) glucose
analogue (18FDG); 2) somatostatin analogue
(68Ga-DOTATOC/68Ga-DOTATATE/68Ga-DOTANOC); 3) aminoacid precursors of bioamines: 
[a) dopamine precursor 18F-DOPA (6-18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine), b) serotonin
precursor 11C-5HTP (11C-5-hydroxytryptophan)]; or 4) dopamine analogue 18F-DA
(6-18F-fluorodopamine). Conventional and contemporary (PET/ CT) somatostatin
receptor detection showed identical high spe- cificity (92%), but conventional
had very low sensitivity (52%) compared to PET/CT (97%). It means that almost
every second neuroendocrine tumor detected by contemporary method cannot be
discovered using conventional (classic) method. In metastatic pheochromocytoma
detection contemporary (PET/ CT) methods (18F-DOPA and 18F-DA) have higher
sensitivity than conventional (131I/123I-MIBG). In medullary thyroid carcinoma
diagnostics contemporary method ([18F-DOPA) is more sensitive than conventional
99mTc(V)-DMSA method, and is similar to 18FDG, computed tomography and magnetic
resonance. In carcinoid detection contemporary method (18F-DOPA) shows similar
results with contemporary somatostatin receptor detection, while for
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors it is worse. To conclude,
contemporary (PET/CT) methods for somatostatin receptor detection
(68Ga-DOTATOC/-NOC/-TATE) in neuroendocrine tumors are much more sensitive
(almost twice) and more accurate than conventional. Therefore the classical
methods should be urgently replaced by contemporary methods.

OBJECTIVES: 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommended
renal-bladder ultrasound (RBUS) as the only evaluation after febrile urinary
tract infection (FUTI) in infants aged 2-24 months. We determined the
sensitivity, specificity, and false negative rate of RBUS to identify
DMSA-detected renal damage in this age group as well as in older children.
METHODS: Consecutive patients referred to pediatric urology with a history of
FUTI underwent DMSA ≥ 3 months after FUTI. Abnormal RBUS was defined as: Society 
of Fetal Urology hydronephrosis grades I-IV; hydroureter ≥ 7 mm; renal scar
defined as focal parenchymal thinning; and/or size discrepancy ≥ 1 cm between
kidneys. Abnormal DMSA was presence of any focal uptake defects and/or split
renal function < 44%. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and
negative predictive values, and false negative rates of RBUS compared to DMSA.
RESULTS: 618 patients (79% female), median age 3.4 years, were referred for
FUTIs. Of the 512 (83%) with normal RBUS, 99 (19%) had abnormal DMSA. Children
with normal RBUS after their first FUTI had abnormal DMSA in 15/151 (10%) aged ≤ 
24 months and 23/119 (19%) aged > 24 months. RBUS had poor sensitivity (34%) and 
low positive predictive value (47%) to identify patients with renal damage.
99/149 (66%) children with renal damage on DMSA had normal RBUS.
CONCLUSION: After FUTI, 66% of children with reduced renal function and/or renal 
cortical defects found by DMSA scintigraphy had a normal RBUS. Since abnormal
DMSA may correlate with increased risk for VUR, recurrent FUTI and renal damage, 
our data suggest RBUS alone will fail to detect a significant proportion of
patients at risk. The data suggest that imaging after FUTI should include acute
RBUS and delayed DMSA, reserving VCUG for patients with abnormal DMSA and/or
recurrent FUTI.

Obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal agenesis (OHVIRA) syndrome should be 
redefined as ipsilateral renal anomalies: cases of symptomatic atrophic and
dysplastic kidney with ectopic ureter to obstructed hemivagina.

OBJECTIVE: Obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal agenesis (OHVIRA) syndrome
is a rare syndrome characterized by mullerian and renal anomalies. Renal agenesis
is classically considered to be part of the definition of OHVIRA syndrome. There 
are increasing reports that the lack of an ipsilateral kidney on imaging studies 
is not from true renal agenesis but renal dysplasia and atrophy. We have observed
cases where this ipsilateral dysplastic and atrophic kidney leads to clinical
symptoms. The objective of this study is to report cases of OHVIRA syndrome where
an ipsilateral dysplastic and atrophic kidney led to clinical symptoms, and to
raise awareness in the pediatric urology community of this variant of OHVIRA
syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All cases of OHVIRA syndrome with an ipsilateral dysplastic
and atrophic kidney were identified from January 2010 to June 2013. The patient's
presentation, clinical course, surgical management, radiologic findings, and
pathologic finding were reviewed.
RESULTS: There were three cases of OHVIRA syndrome with a symptomatic ipsilateral
dysplastic and atrophic kidney identified. All three of these dysplastic and
atrophic kidneys had an ectopic ureter to the obstructed hemivagina and led to
persistent vaginal drainage after resection of the vaginal septum. These
dysplastic and atrophic kidneys were not visualized on any imaging studies.
Laparoscopic removal of the dysplastic and atrophic kidney led to cessation of
vaginal drainage in all cases.
CONCLUSION: This study reports additional cases to the literature that do not fit
the classic definition of OHVIRA syndrome. In the cases in this study, there was 
no ipsilateral renal agenesis, but an ipsilateral dysplastic and atrophic kidney 
with an ectopic ureter to the obstructed hemivagina. In addition, these cases
demonstrate that the dysplastic and atrophic kidney may cause symptoms such as
persistent vaginal drainage after resection of vaginal septum. The dysplastic and
atrophic kidneys may not be detected by any imaging modality including MRI and
DMSA scan and may be ectopic in location. All three of our cases had persistent
vaginal drainage after resection of the vaginal septum which was cured by removal
of the dysplastic and atrophic kidney ipsilateral to the obstructed hemivagina.
The limitations of this study include the small number of patients and
retrospective nature. While the classic definition of OHVIRA syndrome includes
ipsilateral renal agenesis, there is increasing evidence that the absence of a
kidney on imaging is due to renal dysplasia and atrophy and not true renal
agenesis. In addition, we have observed that this dysplastic and atrophic kidney 
may cause clinically significant issues such as persistent vaginal drainage
through an ectopic ureter to the ipsilateral hemivagina after resection of
vaginal septum. This small dysplastic and atrophic kidney may not be visualized
on imaging studies and laparoscopy can be diagnostic and therapeutic if
indicated. Ipsilateral renal anomalies, not ipsilateral renal agenesis, should be
considered part of the definition of OHVIRA syndrome. Pediatric urologists need
to be aware of the spectrum of renal anomalies in OHVIRA syndrome.

INTRODUCTION: Candida bezoar (CB) is a rare finding in neonates and infants with 
candiduria, presenting as necrotic debris with proliferating mycelia in the
collecting system of the kidney. If initial antifungal medical treatment does not
result in clearance of candiduria and disappearance of CB on ultrasound in
dilated kidneys, invasive interventions like insertion of nephrostomy tubes (NT) 
or surgical interventions to drain the kidney are sometimes advocated(.).
However, NT placement can be a technical challenge, especially in pre- and
dysmature neonates, and NT displacement or obstruction by the CB can lead to
suboptimal treatment. Identification of those children who will benefit from
invasive renal drainage is important.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the management of patients with CB in three
tertiary referral hospitals to determine criteria for intervention.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective multicenter chart analysis was conducted
of children with candiduria and ultrasonographic demonstration of CB (diagnosed
between March 1995 and August 2012). The indication for invasive renal drainage
(if performed) and subsequent clinical outcome, serum creatinine levels and
ultrasound findings were assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 12 children were included, two of which were premature
neonates. Eight children had congenital urogenital anomalies. One older child
with acute myeloid leukemia had CB during chemotherapy and one ex-premature
developed CB following cerebral candidiasis. All children received systemic
antifungal medication; in seven children invasive treatment was added.
Indications for invasive treatment were clinical deterioration, progressive renal
dilation, pyonephrosis, rising creatinine levels and persistence of CB. Two
underwent a Y-cutaneous ureterostomy and nephrostomy tubes were inserted in five 
children. Percutaneous renal drainage by nephrostomy led to complications in 3 of
6 procedures. In all patients, irrespective of therapeutic modality, follow-up
ultrasound demonstrated no de novo changes. No additional parenchymal defects or 
deterioration of split renal function were seen on DMSA or MAG-3 scan.
DISCUSSION: In the literature renal drainage is suggested in case of complete
obstruction. However dilatation is a frequent finding in children as part of the 
congenital renal anomaly and does not necessarily mean that there is obstruction 
of the urinary tract. Even in children without candida infections the diagnosis
of obstruction is not straightforward, while the results of a MAG 3 scan can be
obscured by compromised kidney function, parenchymal bacterial infiltration and
neonatal immaturity of the kidney. If candiduria and CB persist despite intensive
medical treatment, intensive consultation is required before renal drainage,
because NT insertion might be a surgical challenge. Complications such as
displacement of the NT, urinoma development, or NT obstruction can occur and was 
seen in three of six procedures. Premature neonates seem to be more prone to
complications due to their small anatomical proportions, requiring medical
equipment with small diameters prone to displacement and obstruction. Some
studies describe successful pharmaceutical management in the majority of patients
with CB. Other studies describe unilateral surgical intervention in children with
bilateral CB where unilateral drainage did not influence overall renal outcome.
This is in line with our results. A limitation of the present study is its
retrospective design. In this population, the motivation for invasive renal
drainage or conservative management was not well documented in all cases, and was
mainly based on clinical and diagnostic parameters like creatinine levels and
radiographic findings.
CONCLUSION: Renal drainage should be considered in selected cases after failure
of systemic antifungal treatment. Inserting and maintaining a nephrostomy tube in
young children is associated with a high rate of complications; conservative
treatment is likely to be sufficient in the majority of patients with candiduria 
and CB.

Gum arabic (GA) is a hydrophilic composite polysaccharide derived from exudates
of Acacia senegal and Acacia seyal trees. It is biocompatible, possesses
emulsifying and stabilizing properties and has been explored as coating agent of 
nanomaterials for biomedical applications, namely magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). 
Previous studies focused on the adsorption of GA onto MNPs produced by
co-precipitation methods. In this work, MNPs produced by a thermal decomposition 
method, known to produce uniform particles with better crystalline properties,
were used for the covalent coupling of GA through its free amine groups, which
increases the stability of the coating layer. The MNPs were produced by thermal
decomposition of Fe(acac)3 in organic solvent and, after ligand-exchange with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), GA coating was achieved by the
establishment of a covalent bond between DMSA and GA moieties. Clusters of
several magnetic cores entrapped in a shell of GA were obtained, with good
colloidal stability and promising magnetic relaxation properties (r2 /r1 ratio of
350). HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell line was used for in vitro cytotoxicity
evaluation and cell-labeling efficiency studies. We show that, upon
administration at the respective IC50 , GA coating enhances MNP cellular uptake
by 19 times compared to particles bearing only DMSA moieties. Accordingly, in
vitro MR images of cells incubated with increasing concentrations of GA-coated
MNP present dose-dependent contrast enhancement. The obtained results suggest
that the GA magnetic nanosystem could be used as a MRI contrast agent for
cell-labeling applications.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: It is still under discussion which is the best tissue
augmenting substance for the endoscopic treatment of children with vesicoureteral
reflux (VUR). We describe our preliminary experience (September 2009-November
2011) with polyacrylate-polyalcohol copolymer hydrogel (PPCH).
METHODS: This is an observational, descriptive, prospective study which included 
81 female and male patients (age 1-14 years) diagnosed with unilateral (n=45) and
bilateral (n=36) primary VUR comprising a total of 117 refluxing renal units
(RRU). Complex cases were excluded from the study. All patients were clinically
and radiologically evaluated and those who met the inclusion criteria were
treated endoscopically with a single subureteral injection of PPCH by a single
surgeon. 11 patients (13.5%) had a pathological 99mTc-DMSA before treatment. The 
volume of injected product was measured in all cases. Results were considered
successful if 6months postinjection, conventional voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG)
revealed VUR was cured (Grade 0). Follow-up ranged from 7 to 32months.
RESULTS: The overall resolution rate based on the number of RRUs studied was
92.3% (108/117). The mean injected volume of PPCH per patient was 0.6ml. One
patient with obstructive anuria required vesicoureteral reimplantation. Other
complications were persistent, self-limiting hematuria (n=2); lumbar pain (n=4)
and urinary tract infection with normal VCUG (n=4).
CONCLUSIONS: Our short term data show PPCH provides a high level of reflux
resolution in selected patients. Long term follow-up is required.

INTRODUCTION: In preclinical research, the growing number of transgenic models
has led to the need for renal-function studies in mice. Many efforts have been
made to develop dedicated SPECT systems for rodents, but their availability is
limited due to high capital costs. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the
feasibility of mouse renal imaging by using an inexpensive alternative based on
clinical gamma-cameras.
METHODS: A healthy mouse was scanned 3 h after injection of 6 mCi of
Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) labeled with 99mTc by using a single-head
gamma-camera in conjunction with a dedicated pinhole collimator. List-mode data
were binned to emulate multiple injections of 1 mCi, 0.1 mCi and 0.01 mCi of
99mTc-DMSA and 6-min ventral and dorsal planar images were acquired and SPECT
imaging (60 projection images acquired over 60 min) was performed. An
optimization of the protocols in terms of injected activity, time scan, renal
cortex uniformity and cortex-to-pelvis contrast was carried out.
RESULTS: The appropriate protocols were an injected activity of 0.6 mCi, combined
with duration of scanning of 1 min for planar and 60 min for SPECT imaging. Our
results were validated through the relative quantification of renal function,
which showed that both kidneys contributed equally to the total function. They
showed that functional structures of the mouse kidneys can be visually
distinguished as easily as in human studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed the feasibility of conducting quantitative DMSA 
SPECT studies of anesthetized mice on clinical gamma cameras.

Thermodynamic characterization of the DmsD binding site for the DmsA
twin-arginine motif.

The system specific chaperone DmsD interacts with the twin-arginine leader
peptide of its substrate, DmsA, allowing for proper folding and assembly of the
DmsA catalytic subunit of dimethyl sulfoxide reductase prior to translocation by 
the twin-arginine translocase. DmsD residues important for binding the complete
45-amino acid sequence of the DmsA leader (DmsAL) peptide were previously
identified and found to cluster in a pocket of the DmsD structure. In this study,
we have utilized isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to determine the
dissociation constant and thermodynamic parameters of 15 single-substitution DmsD
variant proteins and a synthetic DmsAL peptide consisting of 27 amino acids
(DmsAL₁₅₋₄₁). The stoichiometry values were determined via ITC, and the
multimeric compositions of the DmsD variants in the absence and presence of
peptide were characterized via size exclusion chromatography and native
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An up to 4-fold change in affinity was
observed for DmsD variant proteins relative to that of wild-type DmsD, and
variation of the entropic contribution to binding divided the binding site into
two clusters: residues with either more or less favorable entropy. Substitution
of hydrophobic residues along one helix face (helix 5) or prolines found on
adjacent loops caused reduced binding affinity because of the increased entropic 
cost, which suggests that the twin-arginine motif of the DmsAL peptide binds to a
preformed site on DmsD. Most DmsD variants were more than 90% monomeric in
solution and bound a single peptide per protein molecule. The DmsD variant with
the largest dimer population showed increased affinity and induced the formation 
of tetramers in the presence of peptide, suggesting that dimeric DmsD or an
alternatively folded form of DmsD may play an as yet undefined role in binding.

Water renal management is altered more frequently than albuminuria in children in
the G1 stage of the 2012 KDIGO Guideline.

[Article in English, Spanish]

García-Nieto VM, Fortich F, Luis-Yanes MI, Tripodi C, Arango-Sancho P.

BACKGROUND: The G1 stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined in the 2012
KDIGO Guideline as kidney damage characterized by structural or functional kidney
abnormalities without deterioration of glomerular filtration rate. Albuminuria
and electrolyte abnormalities due to tubular disorders are considered functional 
markers of kidney damage. Changes in renal water handling are not explicitly
cited in these guidelines. A large sample of children with abnormal
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan located in the G1 stage was used in this
study.
METHODS: Ambispective, cross-sectional study to evaluate the clinical histories
of 116 pediatric patients. 100 patients were included in the first group (G1
stage) and 16 patients in the G2-G5 stages according to the classification of CKD
Guideline KDIGO. All the patients had a renal pathologic DMSA scan. GFR, maximum 
urine osmolality and albumin/creatinine and NAG/creatinine ratios were
determined.
RESULTS: The patients with normal GFR, in relation to those with reduced GFR, had
significantly higher values of maximum urine osmolality and significantly reduced
values of urine volume and albumin/creatinine and NAG/creatinine ratios. The most
frequently observed alterations in children in the KDIGO G1 stage were those
involving the water renal management such as urinary concentrating ability defect
(29%) and increased urinary volume (20%). The frequency of children with
increased urinary elimination of albumin (12%) and NAG (3%) was more lower. All
children in KDIGO G2-G5 stages had alterations in water renal management.
CONCLUSIONS: The parameters related with the water renal management are affected 
more frequently than albumin urinary excretion in children who have loss of
parenchyma and normal GFR.

Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate for the
diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children.

Shaikh N(1), Borrell JL, Evron J, Leeflang MM.

Author information: 
(1)General Academic Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, 3414 Fifth
Ave, Suite 301, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, 15213.

BACKGROUND: In children with urinary tract infection (UTI), only those with
pyelonephritis (and not cystitis) are at risk for developing long-term renal
sequelae. If non-invasive biomarkers could accurately differentiate children with
cystitis from children with pyelonephritis, treatment and follow-up could
potentially be individualized.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review were to 1) determine whether
procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can
replace the acute DMSA scan in the diagnostic evaluation of children with UTI; 2)
assess the influence of patient and study characteristics on the diagnostic
accuracy of these tests, and 3) compare the performance of the three tests to
each other.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, DARE, Web of Science, and BIOSIS
Previews for this review. The reference lists of all included articles and
relevant systematic reviews were searched to identify additional studies not
found through the electronic search.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We only considered published studies that evaluated the
results of an index test (procalcitonin, CRP, ESR) against the results of an
acute-phase DMSA scan (conducted within 30 days of the UTI) in children aged 0 to
18 years with a culture-confirmed episode of UTI. The following cutoff values
were used for the primary analysis: 0.5 ng/mL for procalcitonin, 20 mg/L for CRP 
and 30 mm/h for ESR.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently applied the selection
criteria to all citations and independently abstracted data. We used the
bivariate model to calculate pooled random-effects pooled sensitivity and
specificity values.
MAIN RESULTS: A total of 24 studies met our inclusion criteria. Seventeen studies
provided data for the primary analysis: six studies (434 children) included data 
on procalcitonin, 13 studies (1638 children) included data on CRP, and six
studies (1737 children) included data on ESR (some studies had data on more than 
one test). The summary sensitivity estimates (95% CI) for the procalcitonin, CRP,
ESR tests at the aforementioned cutoffs were 0.86 (0.72 to 0.93), 0.94 (0.85 to
0.97), and 0.87 (0.77 to 0.93), respectively. The summary specificity values for 
procalcitonin, CRP, and ESR tests at these cutoffs were 0.74 (0.55 to 0.87), 0.39
(0.23 to 0.58), and 0.48 (0.33 to 0.64), respectively.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The ESR test does not appear to be sufficiently accurate to
be helpful in differentiating children with cystitis from children with
pyelonephritis. A low CRP value (< 20 mg/L) appears to be somewhat useful in
ruling out pyelonephritis (decreasing the probability of pyelonephritis to <
20%), but unexplained heterogeneity in the data prevents us from making
recommendations at this time. The procalcitonin test seems better suited for
ruling in pyelonephritis, but the limited number of studies and the marked
heterogeneity between studies prevents us from reaching definitive conclusions.
Thus, at present, we do not find any compelling evidence to recommend the routine
use of any of these tests in clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: Leukocyte count, erythrocyte sediment rate and C-reactive protein
are available laboratory markers which may be helpful in prediction of technetium
Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy results. None of these, 
however, have enough accuracy for prediction of renal injury and scar. This study
was aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of urinary β2-microglobulin in
detection of renal injury in children with acute pyelonephritis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine children between 2 months and 14 years old
with the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis that had no past history of infection 
in the urinary tract system were enrolled in the study. A standard urine sample
according to patients' age was obtained for urine culture, urinalysis, and
urinary β2-microglobulin tests. Blood sample was obtained for leukocyte count,
creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sediment rate,
and electrolytes tests. All patients underwent DMSA scan.
RESULTS: The cutoff point for urinary β2-microglubulin for prediction of positive
DMSA scan was 0.8 mg with a sensitivity of 40.9% (95% CI, 26.3% to 56.8%) and a
specificity of 84.1% (95% CI, 69.9% to 93.4%), a positive predictive value of
72.0% (95% CI, 50.6% to 87.9%) and an negative predictive value of 58.7% (95% CI,
45.6% to 71.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary β2-microglobulin is not enough sensitive and specific to be 
used as a diagnostic marker for prediction of renal injury. Other common markers 
such as erythrocyte sediment rate, leukocyte count, and C-reactive protein can be
used in combination to predict kidney injury in children with acute
pyelonephritis.

BACKGROUND: Iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) have attracted increasing attention over
the past two decades owing to their promising application as biomedical agents.
However, to ensure safe application, their potential nanotoxicity should be
carefully and thoroughly evaluated. Studies on the effects of FeNPs on cells at
the transcriptomic level will be helpful for identifying any potential
nanotoxicity of FeNPs and providing valuable mechanistic insights into various
FeNPs-induced nanotoxicities.
RESULTS: This study investigated the effects of an 11-nm dimercaptosuccinic
acid-coated magnetite nanoparticle on the gene expression profiles of two human
cell lines, THP-1 and HepG2. It was found that the expression of hundreds of
genes was significantly changed by a 24-h treatment with the nanoparticles at two
doses, 50 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL, in the two cell types. By identifying the
differentially expressed genes and annotating their functions, this study
characterized the general and cell-specific effects of the nanoparticles on two
cell types at the gene, biological process and pathway levels. At these doses,
the overall effects of the nanoparticle on the THP-1 cells were the induction of 
various responses and repression of protein translation, but in the HepG2 cells, 
the main effects were the promotion of cell metabolism, growth and mobility. In
combination with a previous study, this study also characterized the common
genes, biological processes and pathways affected by the nanoparticle in two
human and mouse cell lines and identified Id3 as a nanotoxicity biomarker of the 
nanoparticle.
CONCLUSION: The studied FeNPs exerted significant effects on the gene expression 
profiles of human cells. These effects were highly dependent on the innate
biological functions of cells, i.e., the cell types. However, cells can also show
some cell type-independent effects such as repression of Id3 expression. Id3 can 
be used as a nanotoxicity biomarker for iron nanoparticles.

OBJECTIVES: Renal cortical scintigraphy with technetium-99m (Tc-99m)
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is the method of choice to detect acute
pyelonephritis and cortical scarring. Different acquisition methods have been
used: Planar parallel-hole or pinhole collimation and single photon emission
tomography (SPECT). This study compared planar parallel-hole cortical
scintigraphy and dual-head SPECT for detection of cortical defects.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 190 consecutive patients with
380 kidneys and 200 DMSA scans referred to rule out renal cortical scarring. The 
diagnoses were 52 vesicoureteric reflux, 61 recurrent urinary tract infection, 39
hydronephrosis, 20 renal impairment, and 18 hypertension. All patients were
imaged 3 h after injection of Tc-99m DMSA with SPECT and planar imaging
(posterior, anterior, left, and right posterior oblique views). For each patient,
planar and SPECT images were evaluated at different sittings, in random order.
Each kidney was divided into three cortical segments (upper, middle and lower)
and was scored as normal or reduced uptake. The linear correlation coefficient
for the number of abnormal segments detected between planner and SPECT techniques
was calculated.
RESULTS: From 200 DMSA scans, 100 scans were positive for scar in SPECT images,
from which only 95 scans were positive for scar in planner imaging. Out of the
five mismatched scans, three scans were for patients with renal impairment and
high background activity and two scans were for very small scars. No significant 
difference was seen in the average number of abnormal segments detected by planar
versus SPECT imaging (P = 0.31). The average correlation coefficient between was 
high (r = 0.91 - 0.92).
CONCLUSIONS: Tc-99m DMSA renal cortical scanning using SPECT offers no
statistically significant diagnostic advantage over multiple views planar imaging
for detection of cortical defect.

OBJECTIVE: Static renal scintigraphy with Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
is considered a scintigraphic gold standard in detection of post-inflammatory
renal scars. Reports on usefulness of conventional summed (SUM) Tc-99 m
mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) or Tc-99m ethylene dicysteine (EC) dynamic
scintigraphic images in detection of renal scarring are ambiguous and some
authors emphasize low sensitivity of this method. The work aimed at assessment of
a diagnostic efficacy of parametric clearance images (PAR) generated from a
dynamic renal scintigraphy in detection of renal scars.
METHODS: A study group consisting of 80 children (56 girls, 24 boys, age 5-18
years) with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) and documented one to five
incidents of APN-28 children, and with recurrent UTI of the lower part of the
urinary tract only-52 children. Altogether 160 kidneys were evaluated. Static
renal Tc-99m DMSA SPECT scintigraphy and after 2-4 days Tc-99m EC dynamic renal
scintigraphy were performed in every patient not earlier than 6 months after the 
last documented incident of UTI. PAR images generated from a dynamic renal
scintigraphy acquired between 40 and 140 s. generated by in-house developed
software and SUM images obtained in the same time period were compared with a
reference Tc-99m DMSA SPECT study.
RESULTS: For all kinds of images (SPECT, PAR and SUM), high indices of
reproducibility were obtained-89 % (κ = 0.80), 88 % (κ = 0.78) and 89 % (κ =
0.73). Agreement in a Howard scale of a reference method (SPECT) with PAR and SUM
methods amounted to 83 and 64 %, respectively (p = 0.004). Sensitivity and
accuracy of PAR method as compared with SUM method were significantly higher: 89 
vs. 49 % (p < 0.0001) and 88 vs. 73 % (p = 0.002), and specificity was slightly
lower: 88 vs. 93 % (p = 0.043). SPECT and PAR methods revealed higher incidence
of renal scars than a SUM method in patients with documented incident(s) of
APN-64, 68 and 39 %, p = 0.009 and 0.008, respectively.
CONCLUSION: PAR images generated from a dynamic renal scintigraphy improved
sensitivity of detection of renal scars as compared with SUM images, providing a 
high reproducibility and diagnostic efficacy, similar to that of Tc-99m DMSA, in 
detection of post-inflammatory renal scarring.

We report a method for rapid, effective detection of both Cr(iii) and Cr(vi) (in 
the form of Cr(3+) and Cr2O7(2-), the main species of chromium in the natural
environment) by making use of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA)-functionalized gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). The limit of detection (LOD)
is 10 nM with the naked eye and the assay can be applied in detecting chromium in
polluted soil from Yun-Nan Province in Southwest China. We use density functional
theory to calculate the change of the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the interactions 
between the DMSA-Au NP system and various metal ions, which shows that DMSA-Au
NPs have high specificity for both Cr(3+) and Cr2O7(2-).

Urinary tract infections (UTI) can cause significant renal scarring, which can be
complicated by hypertension and renal impairment. This study describes the
outcome of different imaging modalities in children with UTI and its relation to 
age, sex and type of UTI. Our objective was to describe the frequencies of
different imaging studies, which were used to investigate children with UTI at
King Fahad Hospital (KFH) between the years 2003 and 2008. This is a descriptive 
study of all children presenting with UTI at KFH from 2003 to 2008. The study
population, 100 children , were divided into 3 age groups; first group (> 1 month
to 2 years); second group (> 2 to 5 years) , third group (> 5 to 12 years). All
enrolled children were confirmed to have had UTI via urinary cultures. Ninety
seven (97%) patients underwent renal ultrasonography (US), 77 (77%) had a
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan within 2 months of presentation, and 60
(60%) patients underwent micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG), mainly those with
an abnormal DMSA scan. A total of 100 patients screened, 10 (10%) were males and 
90 (90%) were females, first age group constituted 10%, second age group was 25% 
, third age groups was 65%. E-coli was isolated in 84% of patients, 60% had
recurrent UTI, 45% had pyelonephritis, 48.4% had abnormal renal US, 61% had an
abnormal DMSA scan, and 26.6% had abnormal MCUG. UTI can cause significant
morbidity in children if not managed properly. Imaging studies are useful in
identifying children who require advanced medical intervention; however, such
studies should be performed only when indicated.

Williams-Beuren syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by 
congenital heart defects, abnormal facial features, mental retardation with
specific cognitive and behavioral profile, growth hormone deficiency, renal and
skeletal anomalies, inguinal hernia, infantile hypercalcaemia. We report a case
with Williams-Beuren syndrome associated with a single kidney and
nephrocalcinosis complicated by hypercalcaemia. A male infant, aged 20 months
presented growth retardation associated with a psychomotor impairment, dysmorphic
features and nephrocalcinosis. He had also hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia.
Echocardiography was normal. DMSA renal scintigraphy showed a single functioning 
kidney. The FISH generated one ELN signal in 20 metaphases read and found the
presence of ELN deletion, with compatible Williams-Beuren syndrome.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated the protective effect of thymol as a
natural compound against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by quantitative renal
99mTc-DMSA uptake and compared its effect with histopathology in mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were divided into six groups as control, cisplatin
(7.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), thymol+cisplatin (thymol; 50 and
150 mg/kg+cisplatin; 7.5 mg/kg) and thymol (50 and 150 mg/kg). Thymol was orally 
administrated for two days before cisplatin injection and continued for 4 days.
(99m)Tc-DMSA was injected through the tail of mice after the drug administration.
The percentage of the injected dose per gram of kidney tissue (%ID/g) was
calculated. In other experiment, kidneys of treated mice were assessed for
histopathology.
RESULTS: 99mTc-DMSA uptake per gram tissue of the kidneys as %ID/g was
85.27±21.81, 45.55±5.50, 65.02±32.21 and 88.46±20.46 in the control, cisplatin,
thymol (50 mg/kg)+cisplatin and thymol (150 mg/kg)+cisplatin. Thymol
administration with cisplatin resulted in a significant increase in the level of 
%ID/g. Histopathological examinations showed a protective effect of thymol
against cisplatin nephrotoxicity in mice.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that thymol significantly attenuates the
cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in mice, and 99mTc-DMSA uptake in kidney is a
suitable method for assessment of nephrotoxicity in mice.

The aim was to compare the relative renal functions measured with technetium-99m 
dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) and technetium-99m
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) in children with renal diseases. 
Relative renal function of 128 children who applied to three hospitals from 2009 
to 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. The mean value measured with 99mTc-DTPA
and 99mTc-DMSA were 51.58 ± 14.95 and 51.96 ± 14.99 for the right kidney, 47.87 ±
15.27 and 47.94 ± 15.17 for the left kidney, respectively. A significant positive
correlation was found between the relative renal functions (r = 0.963, P <
0.001). In Bland-Altman plots, the mean difference between two methods was 0.7
and the correlation limits were between 10.1 and-10.8. As a result, although
99mTc-DMSA is accepted as the most reliable method for the determination of
relative renal function, 99mTc-DTPA can be another choice for the calculation of 
relative renal function without a complementary DMSA scan particularly in
pediatric patients who require renogram curve and GFR calculations.

Objective - to investigate the morphofunctional cells properties under the action
of magneticallybased nanocomposites containing gadolinium-157. Materials and
methods. Experimental studies are performed in cell culture line L929
Nanocomposites based on magnetite modified by functional amino groups chemically 
fixed by diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and gadolinium -
(Fe3O4/γ-APS/DTPA-Gd) were studied (1), also by meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA) - (Fe3O4/DMSA-Gd), which binds to the hydroxyl group of magnetite surface 
(2); gadolinium was adsorbed from a solution of gadolinium sulfate. Reagent 3 -
magnetic substance Fe3O4 with sodium oleate. Morphofunctional characteristics of 
cell culture were evaluated in various terms by standard indicators of
sustainability: proliferative and mitotic activity and the number of giant
multinuclear cells, apoptosis. Results and conclusions. We established that
magnetdriven nanocomposites with gadolinium modified by DTPA and DMSA, were more 
biocompatibile to cells: incubation of cells with neutron capture agents (NCA) in
the studied range of concentrations showed no toxicity, except maximum
concentration, while decreasing cells adhesive properties. For all nanocomposites
we observed decrease in mitotic activity in the background of the control cell
population density, which may indicate synchronization of cell division. We found
that the stabilized by sodium oleate ferrite caused destructive changes in cell
culture only at concentrations of 500 μg / ml, but reduced mitotic activity in
cell culture in 3-5 times in the whole range of concentrations. It is shown that 
magnetdriven nanocomposites induce different levels of apoptosis in cultured
cells depending on the concentration of the reactants.

INTRODUCTION: The chick embryo is an emerging in vivo model in several areas of
pre-clinical research including radiopharmaceutical sciences. Herein, it was
evaluated as a potential test system for assessing the biodistribution and in
vivo stability of radiopharmaceuticals. For this purpose, a number of
radiopharmaceuticals labeled with (18)F, (125)I, (99m)Tc, and (177)Lu were
investigated in the chick embryo and compared with the data obtained in mice.
METHODS: Chick embryos were cultivated ex ovo for 17-19 days before application
of the radiopharmaceutical directly into the peritoneum or intravenously using a 
vein of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). At a defined time point after
application of radioactivity, the embryos were euthanized by shock-freezing using
liquid nitrogen. Afterwards they were separated from residual egg components for 
post mortem imaging purposes using positron emission tomography (PET) or single
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
RESULTS: SPECT images revealed uptake of [(99m)Tc]pertechnetate and
[(125)I]iodide in the thyroid of chick embryos and mice, whereas
[(177)Lu]lutetium, [(18)F]fluoride and [(99m)Tc]-methylene diphosphonate
([(99m)Tc]-MDP) were accumulated in the bones. [(99m)Tc]-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
((99m)Tc-DMSA) and the somatostatin analog [(177)Lu]-DOTATOC, as well as the
folic acid derivative [(177)Lu]-DOTA-folate showed accumulation in the renal
tissue whereas [(99m)Tc]-mebrofenin accumulated in the gall bladder and intestine
of both species. In vivo dehalogenation of [(18)F]fallypride and of the folic
acid derivative [(125)I]iodo-tyrosine-folate was observed in both species. In
contrast, the 3'-aza-2'-[(18)F]fluorofolic acid ([(18)F]-AzaFol) was stable in
the chick embryo as well as in the mouse.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed the same tissue distribution profile and in
vivo stability of radiopharmaceuticals in the chick embryo and the mouse. This
observation is promising with regard to a potential use of the chick embryo as an
inexpensive and simple test model for preclinical screening of novel
radiopharmaceuticals.

DmsD is a system-specific chaperone that mediates the biogenesis and maturation
of DMSO reductase in Escherichia coli. It is required for DmsAB holoenzyme
formation and its targeting to the cytoplasmic membrane for translocation by the 
twin-arginine translocase. Previous studies suggested that DmsD also interacts
with general molecular chaperones to assist in folding of the reductase subunits.
Here, the interaction between DmsD and GroEL was further characterized to
understand the role of GroEL in DMSO reductase maturation. The inherently weak
interaction between the two was strengthened in vivo under growth conditions that
induce DMSO reductase expression, and the DmsD-GroEL complex showed negligible
change in hydrodynamic diameter by dynamic light scattering when cross-linked.
Mapping the cross-linked sites on DmsD shows that the GroEL binding site is in
close proximity to the previously characterized DmsA leader binding site. These
findings support a role of GroEL in DMSO reductase maturation that likely
involves its chaperonin function for assisting in folding of the DmsA preprotein.

Iron nanoparticles significantly affect the in vitro and in vivo expression of Id
genes.

In recent DNA microarray studies, we found that the transcription of the Id3 gene
was significantly down-regulated in five cell lines (RAW264.7, Hepa1-6, THP-1,
HepG2, and HL7702) treated with two doses (50 and 100 μg/mL) of a DMSA-coated
magnetite nanoparticle. Given the regulatory roles of Id genes in the cell cycle,
growth, and differentiation, we wanted to do more investigations on the effect of
the nanoparticle upon the Id genes. This study detected the expression of Id
genes in six cell lines (the above cell lines plus HeLa) treated with the
nanoparticle at the same doses using quantitative PCR. The results revealed that 
the expression of Id genes was significantly affected by the nanoparticle in
these cell lines. Under each treatment, the Id3 gene was significantly (p < 0.01)
down-regulated in all cell lines, the Id1 gene was significantly down-regulated
in all cell lines except the RAW264.7 cells, and the Id2 gene was significantly
down-regulated in the HepG2, HL7702, and HeLa cells. Because the Id1, Id2, and
Id3 genes were significantly down-regulated in three liver-derived cell lines
(Hepa1-6, HepG2, and HL7702) in both microarray and PCR detections, this study
then detected the expression of Id genes in the liver tissues of mice that were
intravenously injected with the nanoparticle at two doses (2 and 5 mg/kg body
weight). The results revealed that the expression of Id1, Id2, and Id3 genes was 
also significantly down-regulated in the liver tissues under each treatment.
Another Id gene, Id4, was also significantly regulated in some cells or liver
tissues treated with the nanoparticle. These results reveal that the nanoparticle
exerts a significant effect on the in vitro and in vivo expression of Id genes.
This study thus provides new insights into the Id-related nanotoxicity of the
nanoparticle and the close relationship between the regulation of Id genes and
iron.

Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are frequently used for biomedical
applications. Although nanoparticles can enter the brain, little is known so far 
on the uptake of IONPs in neurons and on their neurotoxic potential. Hence, we
applied dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA)-coated IONPs to cultured primary rat
cerebellar granule neurons. These IONPs had average hydrodynamic diameters of
around 80 nm and 120 nm when dispersed in incubation medium in the absence and
the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. Acute exposure of neurons
with IONPs for up to 6 h did neither alter the cell morphology nor compromise
cell viability, although neurons accumulated large amounts of IONPs in a time-
and concentration-dependent manner which caused delayed toxicity. For the first
30 min of incubation of neurons at 37 °C with IONPs the cellular iron content
increased proportionally to the concentration of IONPs applied irrespective of
the absence and the presence of serum. IONP-exposure in the absence of serum
generated maximal cellular iron contents of around 3000 nmol iron/mg protein
after 4 h of incubation, while the accumulation in the presence of 10% serum was 
slower and reached already within 1 h maximal values of around 450 nmol iron/mg
protein. For both incubation conditions was the increase in cellular iron
contents significantly lowered by reducing the incubation temperature to 4 °C.
Application of inhibitors of endocytotic pathways did not affect neuronal IONP
accumulation in the absence of serum, while inhibitors of clathrin-mediated
endocytosis lowered significantly the IONP accumulation in the presence of serum.
These data demonstrate that DMSA-coated IONPs are not acutely toxic to cultured
neurons and that a protein corona around the particles strongly affects their
interaction with neurons.

Recent studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of
technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) renal scans for identifying
high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children with a first febrile urinary
tract infection (UTI). This study aimed to reevaluate the effectiveness of
(99m)Tc-DMSA renal scans for selective voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in
children with a first febrile UTI. The medical records of children aged ≤ 5 years
who were admitted with a first febrile UTI were retrospectively reviewed.
Ultrasonography (US) and DMSA renal scans were performed within 3-5 days after
admission, and VCUG was performed 7-10 days after antibiotics treatment. A total 
of 653 children were enrolled for analysis, including 579 patients aged < 2 years
(Group A) and 74 patients aged 2-5 years (Group B). In Group A, DMSA scans were
abnormal for 346 patients (59.8%), and normal for 233 patients (40.2%).
High-grade VUR was present in 99 of 346 patients (28.9%) with abnormal DMSA
scans, but present in only 16 of 233 patients (6.9%) with normal DMSA scans (p < 
0.001). Regarding the prediction of high-grade VUR, the sensitivity and negative 
predictive value (NPV) for the DMSA scans were 86.1% and 93.1%, respectively. In 
Group B, DMSA scans were abnormal for 36 patients (48.6%), and normal for 38
patients (51.4%). High-grade VUR was present in 12 of 36 patients (33.3%) with
abnormal DMSA scans, whereas none of the 38 patients with normal DMSA scans had
high-grade VUR (p < 0.001). The sensitivity and NPV of the DMSA scans were both
100%. Using the selective VCUG strategy, approximately 40% of Group A patients
and 50% of Group B patients could be spared an unnecessary VCUG, respectively.
Our study results suggest that (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scans are effective in
identifying children with a first febrile UTI for selective VCUG.

A bacterial endotoxin test (BET) is required to detect or quantify bacterial
endotoxin that may be present in radiopharmaceutical preparations. The test uses 
Limulus amebocyte lysate, which, in the presence of bacterial endotoxin and
divalent calcium ions, causes the formation of a coagulin gel. (99m)Tc-labeled
radiopharmaceuticals have chelating ligands such as diethylene triamine
pentaacetic acid (DTPA), ethylene dicysteine (EC), L,L-ethyl cysteinate dimer
(ECD), N-[2,4,6-trimethyl-3 bromoacetanilid] iminodiacetic acid (mebrofenin),
dimercapto succinic acid-III (DMSA-III), dimercapto succinic acid-V (DMSA-V), and
several others, which form a coordination complex with Na-(99m)Tc-O4 in the
presence of reducing agents. During BET by the gel-clot method, the free
sulfhydryl (-SH) and carboxyl (-COOH) in some of the chelating agents in the
final (99m)Tc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals decrease the free divalent calcium ion
concentration, which in turn inhibits coagulin gel formation. This study was
designed using the premise that addition of calcium chloride solution to the
reaction mixture would nullify this effect.METHODS: We present here the data
obtained from BET assay analysis of (99m)Tc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals and the 
cold kits from which they are made (EC, ECD, methoxyisobutylisonitrile, DTPA,
mebrofenin, methylene diphosphonic acid [MDP], DMSA-III, and DMSA-V) using 2
different dilutions, maximum valid dilution (MVD) and half maximum valid dilution
(MVD/2), with and without the addition of calcium chloride at a final
concentration of 300 μM.
RESULTS: It was observed that at MVD and MVD/2 all of the (99m)Tc-labeled kits
exhibited interference in coagulin gel formation with the exception of
(99m)Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile, (99m)Tc-MDP, (99m)Tc-mebrofenin, and
(99m)Tc-ECD. However, only the cold kits of methoxyisobutylisonitrile and MDP did
not show inhibition. An addition of calcium chloride solution nullified this
interference at both MVD and MVD/2 in all of the (99m)Tc-labeled
radiopharmaceuticals in which interference was observed.
CONCLUSION: In practice, Limulus amoebocyte lysate testing is not a method of
choice for (99m)Tc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals because these
radiopharmaceuticals exhibit interference. However, our study proves the
hypothesis that the addition of calcium chloride can circumvent this problem. The
addition of calcium chloride provides an enhanced biologic quality control
testing option for the final formulation of (99m)Tc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals 
at the hospital radiopharmacy end.

Assiut University, Egypt.. Electronic address: heba612@hotmail.com.

AIM: Autism is a developmental disability characterized by severe deficits in
social interaction and communication. The definite cause of autism is still
unknown. The aim of this study is to find out the relation between exposure to
Lead and/or mercury as heavy metals and autistic symptoms, dealing with the heavy
metals with chelating agents can improve the autististic symptoms.
METHOD: Blood and hair samples were obtained from 45 children from Upper Egypt
with autism between the ages of 2 and 10 years and 45 children served as controls
in the same age range, after taken an informed consent and fill a questionnaire
to assess the risk factors. The samples were analyzed blindly for lead and
mercury by using atomic absorption and ICP-MS. Data from the two groups were
compared, then follow up of the autistic children after treatment with chelating 
agents were done.
RESULTS: The results obtained showed significant difference among the two groups,
there was high level of mercury and lead among those kids with autism.
Significant decline in the blood level of lead and mercury with the use of DMSA
as a chelating agent. In addition, there was decline in the autistic symptoms
with the decrease in the lead and mercury level in blood.
CONCLUSION: Lead and mercury considered as one of the main causes of autism.
Environmental exposure as well as defect in heavy metal metabolism is responsible
for the high level of heavy metals. Detoxification by chelating agents had great 
role in improvement of those kids.

The present review provides an update of the general principles for the
investigation and use of chelating agents in the treatment of intoxications by
metals. The clinical use of the old chelators EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetate)
and BAL (2,3-dimercaptopropanol) is now limited due to the inconvenience of
parenteral administration, their own toxicity and tendency to increase the
neurotoxicity of several metals. The hydrophilic dithiol chelators DMSA
(meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) and DMPS (2,3-dimercapto-propanesulphonate)
are less toxic and more efficient than BAL in the clinical treatment of heavy
metal poisoning, and available as capsules for oral use. In copper overload, DMSA
appears to be a potent antidote, although d-penicillamine is still widely used.
In the chelation of iron, the thiols are inefficient, since iron has higher
affinity for ligands with nitrogen and oxygen, but the new oral iron antidotes
deferiprone and desferasirox have entered into the clinical arena. Comparisons of
these agents and deferoxamine infusions are in progress. General principles for
research and development of new chelators are briefly outlined in this review.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) has been proposed as a
definitive treatment for patients with inoperable primary renal cell carcinoma.
However, there is little documentation detailing the radiobiological effects of
hypofractionated radiation on healthy renal tissue.
FINDINGS: In this study we describe a methodology for assessment of regional
change in renal function in response to single fraction SABR of 26 Gy. In a
patient with a solitary kidney, detailed follow-up of kidney function
post-treatment was determined through 3-dimensional SPECT/CT imaging and
(51)Cr-EDTA measurements. Based on measurements of glomerular filtration rate,
renal function declined rapidly by 34% at 3 months, plateaued at 43% loss at 12
months, with minimal further decrease to 49% of baseline by 18 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of renal functional change in (99m)Tc-DMSA uptake on
SPECT/CT imaging correlates with dose delivered. This study demonstrates a dose
effect relationship of SABR with loss of kidney function.

Hernia through a defect of the broad ligament is extremely rare in children.
These defects can result from a developmental defect or a spontaneous rupture of 
cystic formations remnants of mesonephric ducts or Müller. Genital anomalies
associated with unilateral renal agenesis are more common in females. We report
the case of a 13 months girl allowed for assessment of recurrent urinary tract
infection; abdominal examination did not objectified palpable mass, the external 
genitalia were without abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a left renal 
space is empty with a retrovesical cyst. Cystography was requested that
objectified a large pelvic cystic mass retrovesical communicating with the
bladder, there was also a left vesicoureteral reflux. Uro- MRI showed a cystic
formation retrovesical communicating with the bladder, the right pelvic kidney;
uterus is normal size for age. DMSA scintigraphy confirmed the absence of the
left kidney with the right kidney that ensures 100% of total renal function. To
surgical exploration we found a hernia of the bladder through the left broad
ligament, the uterus was dislocated on the right side; left ovary was hypoplasic;
the ipsilateral ureter was blind with renal agenesis, we performed by reduction
of the bladder then closing the hernial orifice, dissection of the ureter with
its ligation and section at the vesical stoma. The postoperative course was
uneventful. Evolution is favorable. This observation illustrates a hernia of the 
bladder through the broad ligament associated with ovarian hypoplasia, renal
agenesis and ipsilateral ureter blind ending; this association was not described 
to our knowledge in the literature.

Magnetically induced heating of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) in an alternating
magnetic field (AMF) is a promising minimally invasive tool for localized tumor
treatment by sensitizing or killing tumor cells with the help of thermal stress. 
Therefore, the selection of MNP exhibiting a sufficient heating capacity
(specific absorption rate, SAR) to achieve satisfactory temperatures in vivo is
necessary. Up to now, the SAR of MNP is mainly determined using ferrofluidic
suspensions and may distinctly differ from the SAR in vivo due to immobilization 
of MNP in tissues and cells. The aim of our investigations was to study the
correlation between the SAR and the degree of MNP immobilization in dependence of
their physicochemical features. In this study, the included MNP exhibited varying
physicochemical properties and were either made up of single cores or multicores.
Whereas the single core MNP exhibited a core size of approximately 15 nm, the
multicore MNP consisted of multiple smaller single cores (5 to 15 nm) with 65 to 
175 nm diameter in total. Furthermore, different MNP coatings, including
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyethylenglycol (PEG), 
and starch, wereinvestigated. SAR values were determined after the suspension of 
MNP in water. MNP immobilization in tissues was simulated with 1% agarose gels
and 10% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels. The highest SAR values were observed
in ferrofluidic suspensions, whereas a strong reduction of the SAR after the
immobilization of MNP with PVA was found. Generally, PVA embedment led to a
higher immobilization of MNP compared to immobilization in agarose gels. The
investigated single core MNP exhibited higher SAR values than the multicore MNP
of the same core size within the used magnetic field parameters. Multicore MNP
manufactured via different synthesis routes (fluidMAG-D, fluidMAG/12-D) showed
different SAR although they exhibited comparable core and hydrodynamic sizes.
Additionally, no correlation between ζ-potential and SAR values after
immobilization was observed. Our data show that immobilization of MNP,
independent of their physicochemical properties, can distinctly affect their SAR.
Similar processes are supposed to take place in vivo, particularly when MNP are
immobilized in cells and tissues. This aspect should be adequately considered
when determining the SAR of MNP for magnetic hyperthermia.

Moringa oleifera is a tree belonging to Moringaceae family and its leaves and
seeds are reported to have ameliorative effects against metal toxicity. In the
present investigation, M. oleifera seed powder was tested against lead-induced
oxidative stress and compared against meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
treatment. Male Wistar rats (100-120 g) were divided into four groups: control
(2000 ppm of sodium acetate for 2 weeks), exposed (2000 ppm of lead acetate for 2
weeks), Moringa treated (500 mg/kg for 7 days after lead exposure), and DMSA
treated (90 mg/kg for 7 days after lead exposure). After exposure and treatment
periods, rats were sacrificed and the brain was separated into cerebellum,
hippocampus, frontal cortex, and brain stem; liver, kidney, and blood were also
collected. The data indicated a significant (p<0.05) increase in reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), lipid perioxidation products (LPP), total protein carbonyl content
(TPCC), and metal content of brain regions, liver, and kidney in the exposed
group compared with their respective controls. In the blood, delta-amino
levulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity, RBC, WBC, hemoglobin, and hematocrit 
showed significant (p<0.05) decrease on lead exposure. However, administration of
M. oleifera restored all the parameters back to control, tissue-specifically, and
also showed improvement in restoration better than DMSA treatment, indicating
reduction of the negative effects of lead-induced oxidative stress.

infection.

INTRODUCTION: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common pediatric urologic
disorder. After the first urinary tract infection (UTI), imaging studies are
recommended, starting with a renal ultrasound (RUS). Voiding cystourethrography
(VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan are the other main radiologic
studies used to detect VUR. We evaluated the use of RUS as a screening method for
VUR in children below 2 years of age, in order to avoid unnecessary VCUG.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records and imaging studies of infants (<2 years) 
who had their first UTI in a 6 year period were retrospectively reviewed. We
evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values of RUS and
DMSA for diagnosing VUR.
RESULTS: Among 155 children (51% males) with their first UTI, 148 RUS were
performed, 128 VCUG and 29 DMSA. VUR was detected in 21% patients; 14.5% low
grade and 6.5% high grade. One hundred and twenty-one patients underwent both RUS
and VCUG, 101 RUS were normal and 20 abnormal. Of the normal RUS 98% had no or
low grade VUR. Among those with an abnormality on RUS 30% had high grade VUR (P <
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: After the first UTI in infants (<2 years) RUS is a good screening
method for VUR. Among such shildren with a normal RUS, we do not recommend VCUG
or DMSA. In our opinion, VCUG should be performed only in patients with abnormal 
findings in RUS or in recurrent UTI.

PURPOSE: We aimed to compare the efficacies of gallium-68 (68Ga) DOTATATE
PET-computed tomography (CT), fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET-CT and
technetium-99m (99mTc)-(V)DMSA scintigraphy in the detection of
residual/metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).
MATERIALS AND METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated DOTATATE PET-CT, 18F-FDG
PET-CT and (V)DMSA scintigraphy of 22 MTC patients, all taken within a 6-month
period in each patient, because of high levels of calcitonin (Ct) and
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). We investigated the relationships between the
results of the imaging modalities and tumour marker levels and the sporadic
versus hereditary nature of the disease, as well as the effect of imaging results
on patient management.
RESULTS: The ages of the patients at diagnosis were between 20 and 69 years. The 
median levels of Ct and CEA were 871.5 pg/ml and 11.2 ng/ml, respectively. In the
patient-based analysis, we observed at least one focus of abnormal uptake in 15
of 22 DOTATATE PET-CT (68.2% sensitivity), eight of 18 18F-FDG PET-CT (44.4%
sensitivity) and five of 15 (V)DMSA scans (33.3% sensitivity). These data showed 
a significant difference between DOTATATE PET-CT and (V)DMSA scintigraphy
(P=0.016), whereas the relationships between DOTATATE PET-CT and 18F-FDG PET-CT
and between 18F-FDG PET-CT and (V)DMSA scintigraphy showed no significant
differences (P>0.05). In the lesion-based analysis, 134 lesions were detected
with DOTATATE PET-CT, 76 lesions with 18F-FDG PET-CT and nine lesions with
(V)DMSA scintigraphy.
CONCLUSION: DOTATATE PET-CT is an efficient imaging modality in MTC patients with
increased Ct and CEA (especially >1000 pg/ml and 50 ng/ml, respectively) for
localizing recurrent or metastatic disease. 18F-FDG PET-CT can be performed if
DOTATATE PET-CT is not available, but (V)DMSA scintigraphy is not recommended.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present was to investigate whether the in vitro
effects of gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, may regulate the
expression of type III sodium phosphate Na/Pi co-transporters in an in vitro
glioma model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proliferation studies, global native EGFR and
phosphorylated EGFR expressions, phosphate transporter type III isoform 1(PiT1)
expression and phosphate transport with 99mTc-(V)-DMSA radioligand were performed
in G111 (grade II astrocytoma), U-87-MG (grade III astrocytoma) and G152 (grade
IV glioblastoma) cells.
RESULTS: Cells treated with gefitinib showed a significant decrease in
proliferation in relation to EGFR and p-EGFR expression. Gefitinib also produced 
a decrease in phosphate transport mediated PIT1 expression at both the RNA and
protein levels.
CONCLUSION: The link between gefitinib acting on the EGFR and PiT1 regulation in 
these cancer cell lines was herein shown.

Comment in
    Clin Exp Nephrol. 2016 Oct;20(5):823-824.

BACKGROUND: Acute pyelonephritis (APN) can lead to renal scar formation, high
blood pressure, and end-stage renal failure. Prompt and early diagnosis of APN is
important for preventing future complications. Our goal was to study the mean
platelet volume (MPV) as a predictor of APN in children.
METHODS: The records of 43 patients with APN and 51 patients with a lower urinary
tract infection (UTI) were investigated prospectively. APN was confirmed using
radioactive nuclide 99mTc-DMSA scanning. The white blood cell (WBC) count,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and MPV of 
both groups were measured and compared.
RESULTS: The WBC count, MPV and ESR values, and the serum concentration of CRP
were higher in the APN group than in the lower UTI group (p < 0.05). In the
children with APN, the optimal cut-off value for the MPV was 8.2 fl [area under
the curve (AUC): 0.906], with sensitivity of 81.4 % and specificity of 86.3 %.
The MPV was associated with APN (p = 0.001), and the sensitivity and specificity 
of the MPV for the diagnosis of APN were higher than those of the other
inflammation markers. MPV > 8.2 fl yielded an adjusted OR of 7.8 (95 % CI
3.3-18.4, p < 0.001) for APN. MPV > 8.2 fl was significantly associated with late
renal scar formation (adjusted OR 5.7, 95 % CI 2.3-13.8, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The MPV is a fast and reliable measurement with considerable
predictive value for the diagnosis of APN and renal scars, and its predictive
capacity is better than that of CRP, ESR, and WBC values.

INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of renal cortical lesions by radioisotopes in nuclear
medicine is one of the most common techniques and procedures can be performed by 
different radiotracer. However, all these materials are accurate in determining
kidney function, but there are differences between them in the field. The purpose
of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of EC scans compared with DMSA
scan in the detection of cortical lesions and DRF.
METHODS: 65 cases, which have been referred for various reasons, for DMSA scans
were enrolled. Patients 1 week after DMSA scan with the previous consent of the
EC being scanned. The results were compared in terms of convergence as well as
sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of EC with
respect to the results of DMSA scan.
RESULTS: PPV of EC was 100%, negative predictive value of EC was 68.75%,
sensitivity of EC was 90.74% and specificity of EC was 100% in the detection of
cortical lesions. DMSA scan and EC convergence rates result in cortical lesions
in our study was high.
DISCUSSION: We suggest EC scan as an alternative to reduce the cost of therapy
and radiation, but considering the benefits of DMSA scan, it could remain the
gold standard method of diagnosis.

Pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99m (V) DMSA) is reported 
as a useful tool for detection of residual or recurrent gliomas. We aimed to
investigate the prognostic value of Tc-99m (V) DMSA brain SPECT in patients with 
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). 40 patients [21 males and 19 females; mean age
48.6 ± 12.2 years] with GBM were included. Tc-99m (V) DMSA brain SPECT was done
after surgery and before onset of radiation therapy or chemotherapy (Baseline
study), at 4-6 weeks and at 6 months as a follow-up after therapy. The end point 
of the study was clinical follow-up for 2 years and/or death. 4-6 weeks after
therapy, 40 and 60 % had negative and positive Tc-99m (V) DMSA for viable tumor
tissues respectively (P = 0.09). At 6 months follow-up, 62.5 % of (V) DMSA
negative patients and 12.5 % of the positive subjects were responders (P =
0.001). The median over-all survival (OS) of all patients was 12.3 month [range
5-24 month]. Patients with positive (V) DMSA had worse survival (8.87 month)
compared to the negative ones (16.67 month) (P = 0.0001). Multivariate Cox
regression analysis showed that Tc-99m (V) DMSA brain SPECT studies at 4-6 weeks 
and 6-months follow-up were independent prognostic factors for survival [OR
1.069; 95 % CI 1.417-2.174; P = 0.03 and OR 1.055; 95 % CI 0.821-1.186; P = 0.01 
respectively]. Stratification of tumors into risk groups based on prognostic
parameters may improve outcome by altering or intensifying treatment methods.
Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid brain SPECT may have an additional
prognostic role in patients with GBM which needs further evaluation in larger
future series.

Over the last decade, various magnetic nanomaterials have been developed as
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents; the greatest challenges
encountered for clinical application have been insufficient stability. In this
paper, a lyophilization method for 2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid-modified iron
oxide (γ-Fe2 O3 @DMSA) nanoparticles was developed to simultaneously overcome two
disadvantages; these include insufficient stability and low-magnetic response.
After lyophilization, the clusters of γ-Fe2 O3 @DMSA with the size of 156.7 ±
15.3 nm were formed, and the stability of the lyophilized powder (γ-Fe2 O3
@DMSA-LP) increased up to over 3 years. It was also found that rehydrated γ-Fe2
O3 @DMSA-LP could be ingested by RAW264.7 cells in very large quantities. Results
of pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies in vivo indicated that γ-Fe2 O3
@DMSA-LP is a promising liver-targeted material. Furthermore, it also exhibited
higher MRI efficiency and longer imaging time in the liver than the well-known
product Feridex(®) . Moreover, results of vascular irritation and long-term
toxicity experiments demonstrated γ-Fe2 O3 @DMSA-LP could be a nontoxic,
biocompatible contrast agent in vivo. Therefore, the proposed γ-Fe2 O3 @DMSA-LP
can be used as a potential MRI contrast agent in clinic for hepatic diseases.

Oleic acid coated iron oxide nanoparticles synthesized by thermal decomposition
in organic medium are highly monodisperse but at the same time are unsuitable for
biological applications. Ligand-exchange reactions are useful to make their
surface hydrophilic. However, these could alter some structural and magnetic
properties of the modified particles. Here we present a comprehensive study and
comparison of the effects of employing either citric acid (CA) or
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) ligand-exchange protocols for phase
transfer of monodisperse hydrophobic iron oxide nanoparticles produced by thermal
decomposition of Fe(acac)3 in benzyl ether. We show the excellent hydrodynamic
size distribution and colloidal stability of the hydrophilic particles obtained
by the two protocols and confirm that there is a certain degree of oxidation
caused by the ligand-exchange. CA revealed to be more aggressive towards the iron
oxide surface than DMSA and greatly reduced the saturation magnetization values
and initial susceptibility of the resulting particles compared to the native
ones. Besides being milder and more straightforward to perform, the DMSA ligand
exchange protocol produces MNP chemically more versatile for further
functionalization possibilities. This versatility is shown through the covalent
linkage of gum Arabic onto MNP-DMSA using carboxyl and thiol based chemical
routes and yielding particles with comparable properties.

BACKGROUND: In 2010, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) discovered extensive lead
poisoning impacting several thousand children in rural northern Nigeria. An
estimated 400 fatalities had occurred over 3 mo. The US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed widespread contamination from lead-rich
ore being processed for gold, and environmental management was begun. MSF
commenced a medical management programme that included treatment with the oral
chelating agent 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, succimer). Here we describe
and evaluate the changes in venous blood lead level (VBLL) associated with DMSA
treatment in the largest cohort of children ≤ 5 y of age with severe paediatric
lead intoxication reported to date to our knowledge.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a retrospective analysis of programme data, we describe 
change in VBLL after DMSA treatment courses in a cohort of 1,156 children ≤ 5 y
of age who underwent between one and 15 courses of chelation treatment. Courses
of DMSA of 19 or 28 d duration administered to children with VBLL ≥ 45 µg/dl were
included. Impact of DMSA was calculated as end-course VBLL as a percentage of
pre-course VBLL (ECP). Mixed model regression with nested random effects was used
to evaluate the relative associations of covariates with ECP. Of 3,180 treatment 
courses administered, 36% and 6% of courses commenced with VBLL ≥ 80 µg/dl and ≥ 
120 µg/dl, respectively. Overall mean ECP was 74.5% (95% CI 69.7%-79.7%); among
159 inpatient courses, ECP was 47.7% (95% CI 39.7%-57.3%). ECP after 19-d courses
(n = 2,262) was lower in older children, first-ever courses, courses with a
longer interval since a previous course, courses with more directly observed
doses, and courses with higher pre-course VBLLs. Low haemoglobin was associated
with higher ECP. Twenty children aged ≤ 5 y who commenced chelation died during
the period studied, with lead poisoning a primary factor in six deaths.
Monitoring of alanine transaminase (ALT), creatinine, and full blood count
revealed moderate ALT elevation in <2.5% of courses. No clinically severe adverse
drug effects were observed, and no laboratory findings required discontinuation
of treatment. Limitations include that this was a retrospective analysis of
clinical data, and unmeasured variables related to environmental exposures could 
not be accounted for.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral DMSA was a pharmacodynamically effective chelating agent for
the treatment of severe childhood lead poisoning in a resource-limited setting.
Re-exposure to lead, despite efforts to remediate the environment, and
non-adherence may have influenced the impact of outpatient treatment. Please see 
later in the article for the Editors' Summary.

Long-Term Results of Anderson-Hynes Pyeloplasty in Children: How Long Follow-Up
Is Necessary?

Brazil.

PURPOSE: After a successful pyeloplasty at 3 to 6 months, the question remains
whether children need a long follow-up.
METHODS: The medical charts of patients with long-term follow-up (> 5 years), who
underwent dismembered pyeloplasty for uretero-pelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) 
from May 1998 to May 2007, excluding those with bilateral UPJO, solitary kidney, 
associated vesicoureteral reflux or other abnormalities, and inconclusive
renogram due to poor renal function, were retrospectively reviewed.
Ultrasonography, differential renal function (DRF, DMSA), and renal drainage on
diuretic renography (diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate technetium-99 or DTPA-Tc99)
were performed at 3 and 6 months every year.
RESULTS: Complete data were available for 28 consecutive patients (28 renal
unities) with 2 months to 12 years (mean age, 2.4 years) at surgery, of whom 21
(75%) were boys, 17 diagnosed prenatally (61%) and 18 unities (64.3%) were left, 
with median follow-up of 10.7 years. Images were graded according to the Society 
for Fetal Urology grading system: Grade III in 11 (49%) and grade IV in 17 (61%).
All cases presented > 10% DRF (DMSA) and obstructed DTPA-Tc99. The T1/2 (the
half-time of drainage) less than 20 minutes at 3 months was found in 21 cases
(75%) and less than 25 minutes in 7 cases (25%). Renal function and patency were 
maintained during follow-up for all units with 8% maximum fluctuation of DRF. One
index case (3.6%) of renal function deterioration presented DRF fluctuation > 8% 
at 3 months (from 23 to 32%) and progressive hydronephrosis and indeterminate
DTPA at 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Satisfactory diuretic renogram at 3 to 6 months after pyeloplasty
with maintained renal function and stable hydronephrosis suggests no need for
further follow-up and indicates no functional loss with time. More than 8% DRF
fluctuation might be a significant cutoff for further intervention aiming nephron
preservation.

INTRODUCTION: To determine the parameters affecting the outcome of
ureteroneocystostomy (UNC) procedure for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 398 patients who underwent UNC procedure from 2001
to 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. Different UNC techniques were used
according to laterality of reflux and ureteral orifice configuration. Effects of 
several parameters on outcome were examined. Disappearance of reflux on control
VCUG or absence of any kind of UTI/symptoms in patients without control VCUG was 
considered as clinical improvement.
RESULTS: Mean age at operation was 59.2 ± 39.8 months and follow-up was 25.6 ±
23.3 months. Grade of VUR was 1-2, 3 and 4-5 in 17, 79, 302 patients,
respectively. Male to female ratio was 163/235. UNC was performed bilaterally in 
235 patients and intravesical approach was used in 373 patients. The frequency of
voiding dysfunction, scar on preoperative DMSA, breakthrough infection and
previous surgery was 28.4%, 70.7%, 49.3% and 22.4%, respectively. Twelve patients
(8.9%) with postoperative contralateral reflux were excluded from the analysis.
Overall clinical improvement rate for UNC was 92%. Gender, age at diagnosis and
operation, laterality and grade of reflux, mode of presentation, breakthrough
infections (BTI) under antibiotic prophylaxis, presence of voiding dysfunction
and renal scar, and operation technique did not affect the surgical outcome.
However, the clinical improvement rate was lower in patients with a history of
previous endoscopic intervention (83.9% vs. 94%). Postoperative UTI rate was
27.2% and factors affecting the occurrence of postoperative UTI were previous
failed endoscopic injection on univariate analysis and gender, preoperative BTI, 
postoperative VUR state, voiding dysfunction on multivariate analysis. Surgery
related complication rate was 2% (8/398). These were all low grade complications 
(blood transfusion in 1, hematoma under incision in 3 and prolonged
hospitalization secondary to UTI in 4 patients). In long term, 12 patients are
under nephrologic follow-up because of hypertension in 5, increased serum
creatinine in 5, proteinuria in 1 and hematuria in 1 patient and all these
patients had preoperative scarred kidneys.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its invasive nature, UNC has a very high success rate with a
negligible percent of complications. In our cohort, the only factor that
negatively affected the clinical improvement rate was the history of previous
antireflux interventions where the predictive factors for postoperative UTI were 
previous failed endoscopic injection, female gender, preoperative BTI, persistent
VUR and voiding dysfunction.

Thiol-functionalized porous silicon (PS) monolayer was evaluated for its possible
application in As (III) adsorption. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) attached to
mesoporous silicon via amide bond linkages was used as a chelate for As (III).
Two different aminosilanes namely 3-(aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) and
3-aminopropyl (diethoxy)-methylsilane (APDEMS) were tested as linkers to evaluate
the relative response for DMSA attachment. The aminosilane-modified PS samples
were attached to DMSA by wet impregnation followed by the adsorption of As (III).
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have
been used to identify the functional groups and to estimate the As (III) content,
respectively. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the covalent bonding of DMSA with amide
and R-COOH groups on the nanostructured porous surface. XPS confirms the
preferred arsenic adsorption on the surface of PS/DMSA samples as compared to the
aminosilane-modified and bare PS substrates.

Tc-99m DMSA and Tc-99m EC studies are invaluable functional imaging modalities
for renal structural and functional assessment. Normally, the relative renal
function estimated by the two methods correlates well with each other. We here
present two patients with renal tubular acidosis who showed impaired/altered DMSA
uptake with normal EC renal dynamic study depicting the pitfall of DMSA imaging
in tubular disorders. The two presented cases also depict distinct pattern of
Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphic findings in patients with proximal and distal renal
tubular acidosis, thus highlighting the factors affecting DMSA kinetics.

BACKGROUND: Many radio-pharmaceuticals have been used over the years to localize 
the recurrences in patients with medullary carcinoma thyroid (MCT), including
iodine-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine, thallium-201, technitium-99m
dimercaptosuccinyl acid [Tc-99m DMSA (V)], Tc-99m methoxyisobutylisonitril, Tc-99
ethylenediamine diacetic acid/hydrazinonicotinyl-Tyr (3)-octreotide, and In-111
diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid-octreotide with varying sensitivities and
specificities.
AIMS: The aim of this study is to explore the role of Tc-99m DMSA (V) scan in MCT
patients with postoperative persistent hypercalcitoninemia in the positron
emission tomography-computerized tomography (PET-CT) era.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 53 patients with proven sporadic
MCT, who presented to our institution over a period 28 years from 1985 to 2012,
was performed. Patients with persistently elevated levels of serum calcitonin
(>150 pg/ml) were initially evaluated by a DMSA scan if conventional imaging
failed to localize any focus of disease.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the postoperative levels of serum 
calcitonin significantly correlated with the overall survival of our patients and
can possibly serve as a good prognostic marker. Tc-99m DMSA (V) scans
demonstrated a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 56%, a positive predictive
value of 50%, and a negative predictive value of 80% in detecting metastasis in
postoperative persistent hypercalcitoninemia. Our study showed that Tc-99m DMSA
(V) scanning is an affordable and a reasonably sensitive imaging agent for
localization of recurrent/metastatic disease. PET-CT seems to be a useful
complementary tool and needs to be kept in the armamentarium for diagnosis of
recurrence especially in cases of discordance between Tc-99m DMSA (V) scan and
the serum calcitonin levels.

young and adult rats.

[Article in English, Portuguese]

Paulista, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Combination therapy can play a significant role in the amelioration
of several toxic effects of lead (Pb) and recovery from associated cardiovascular
changes.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of combination therapy on the
cardiovascular effects of perinatal lead exposure in young and adult rats
Methods: Female Wistar rats received drinking water with or without 500 ppm of Pb
during pregnancy and lactation. Twenty-two- and 70-day-old rat offspring who were
or were not exposed to Pb in the perinatal period received
meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), L-arginine, or enalapril and a combination
of these compounds for 30 additional days. Noradrenaline response curves were
plotted for intact and denuded aortas from 23-, 52-, 70-, and 100-day-old rats
stratified by perinatal Pb exposure (exposed/unexposed) and treatment received
(treated/untreated).
RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure was evaluated and shown to be higher in the 23-,
52-, 70-, and 100-day age groups with Pb exposure than in the corresponding
control age groups: 117.8 ± 3.9*, 135.2 ± 1.3*, 139.6 ± 1.6*, and 131.7 ± 2.8*,
respectively and 107.1 ± 1.8, 118.8 ± 2.1, 126.1 ± 1.1, and 120.5 ± 2.2,
respectively (p < 0.05). Increased reactivity to noradrenaline was observed in
intact, but not denuded, aortas from 52-, 70-, and 100-day-old exposed rats, and 
the maximum responses (g of tension) in the respective Pb-exposed and control age
groups were as follows: 3.43 ± 0.16*, 4.32 ± 0.18*, and 4.21 ± 0.23*,
respectively and 2.38 ± 0.33, 3.37 ± 0.13, and 3.22 ± 0.21, respectively (p <
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: All treatments reversed the changes in vascular reactivity to
noradrenaline in rats perinatally exposed to Pb. The combination therapy resulted
in an earlier restoration of blood pressure in Pb-exposed rats compared with the 
monotherapies, except for enalapril therapy in young rats. These findings
represent a new approach to the development of therapeutic protocols for the
treatment of Pb-induced hypertension.

Does percutaneous nephrolithotomy and its outcomes have an impact on renal
function? Quantitative analysis using SPECT-CT DMSA.

To assess the functional effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and its
outcomes in the operated kidney, we prospectively studied 30 consecutive cases
undergoing PCNL. Kidney function was evaluated preoperatively and 3 months after 
surgery with serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and with
(99m)Tc-DMSA SPECT-CT scans to determine the differential renal function (DRF).
PCNL effects in the operated kidney DRF were considered globally (DRFPLANAR,
DRFSPECT) and in the region of percutaneous access (DRFACCESS). PCNL functional
impact was also assessed depending on its outcomes, namely success (stone-free
status) and the development of perioperative complications. PCNL has rendered 73 
% of the cases completely stone free with a 33 % complication rate. After PCNL,
serum creatinine and GFR did not change significantly, whereas DRFPLANAR and
DRFSPECT dropped 1.2 % (p = 0.014) and 1.0 % (p = 0.041), respectively. The
highest decrease was observed in DRFACCESS (1.8 %, p = 0.012). Stone-free status 
after PCNL did not show any impact on kidney function. Conversely, cases that
suffered from a complication showed impairment in serum creatinine (0.1 mg/dL, p 
= 0.028), in GFR (11.1 mL/min, p = 0.036) as well as in DRFPLANAR (2.7 %, p =
0.018), DRFSPECT (2.2 %, p = 0.023) and DRFACCESS (2.7 %, p = 0.049). We conclude
that PCNL has a minimal impact on global kidney function, which is mainly located
in the region of percutaneous access. The advent of perioperative complications
increased PCNL functional damage, whereas the stone-free status did not show any 
meaningful effect.

Summary Amyloidosis is a clinical condition caused by deposition of various
protein fibrills in extracellular space. The presented symptoms depend on the
type of deposits and the organ or organs involved. The correct diagnosis is often
difficult, due to lack of nonivasive imaging techniques and insufficiency of
morphological imaging procedures delievered by radiology. We presented a list of 
potential radiopharmaceuticals that can be used in detecting various types of
amyloidoses. (123)I-SAP proved to have high sensitivity in imaging of AA and AL
amyloidosis in visceral organs. (99m)Tc-Aprotinin was found to be useful in
detecting cardiac amyloidosis. A couple of classical radiotracers, such as
(201)Tl, (123)I-mIBG, together with (111)In-antimyosin were also tested for
accuracy in cardiac imaging, however the main problem was low specificity.
Potential applicability was also found in case of some bone-seeking agents and
other radiotracers, e.g. (67)Ga-citrate and (99m)Tc-penta-DMSA. High sensitivity 
and specificity was achieved with β2-microglobulin labeled with (131)I or
(111)In. Among PET tracers, (11)C-PIB deserves more attention, because it may
have an important role in diagnosing of AD in the near future. Further clinical
studies are expected to take place, because noninvasive diagnosing and monitoring
of amyloidosis is still a challenge.

BACKGROUND: Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging is a promising method
for noninvasive evaluation of the renal parenchyma.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the contribution of ARFI quantitative US elastography
for the detection of renal damage in kidneys with and without vesicoureteral
reflux (VUR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy-six kidneys of 88 children (46 male,
42 female) who had been referred for voiding cystourethrography and 20 healthy
controls were prospectively investigated. Patients were assessed according to
severity of renal damage on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.
Ninety-eight age- and gender-matched healthy children constituted the control
group. Quantitative shear wave velocity (SWV) measurements were performed in the 
upper and lower poles and in the interpolar region of each kidney. DMSA
scintigraphy was performed in 62 children (124 kidneys). Comparisons of SWV
values of kidneys with and without renal damage and/or VUR were done.
RESULTS: Significantly higher SWV values were found in non-damaged kidneys.
Severely damaged kidneys had the lowest SWV values (P < 0.001). High-grade (grade
V-IV) refluxing kidneys had the lowest SWV values, while non-refluxing kidneys
had the highest values (P < 0.05). Significant negative correlations were found
between the mean quantitative US elastography values and DMSA scarring score
(r = -0.788, P < 0.001) and VUR grade (r = -0.634, P < 0.001). SWV values of the 
control kidneys were significantly higher than those of damaged kidneys
(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest decreasing SWV of renal units with increasing
grades of vesicoureteric reflux, increasing DMSA-assessed renal damage and
decreasing DMSA-assessed differential function.

Predictive factors for kidney damage in febrile urinary tract infection.
Usefulness of procalcitonin.

[Article in English, Spanish]

Lucas-Sáez E, Ferrando-Monleón S, Marín-Serra J, Bou-Monterde R, Fons-Moreno J,
Peris-Vidal A, Hervás-Andrés A.

OBJECTIVE: To establish the utility of procalcitonin (PCT) and other clinical and
analytical parameters as markers of acute and permanent renal damage in children 
after a first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: Retrospective multicentre study. Statistical study: descriptive,
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: 219 patients, aged between 1 week and 14 years (68% under 1 year). The
mean PCT values were significantly higher in patients with acute pyelonephritis
with respect to normal acute DMSA (4.8 vs 1.44; p=0.0001), without achieving that
signification for late affected DMSA (6.5 vs 5.05; p=0.6). The area under the ROC
curve for PCT was 0.64 (CI 95% 0.55-0.72) for acute renal damage, and 0.62 (CI
95% 0.44-0.80) for permanent damage, with optimum statistical cut-off values of
0.85 and 1.17ng/ml. Multivariate analysis for acute renal damage only found
correlation with PCT (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.2 (CI 95% 1.06-1.4, p=0.005), and hours
of fever (OR for less than 6 hours of fever 0.4 (CI 95% 0.2-1.02, p=0.05). In
patients with renal scarring, PCT showed an OR 1.0 (CI 95% 0.9-1.1, p=0.6).
CONCLUSIONS: PCT and the duration of fever were the only parameters statistically
associated with early renal damage. PCT and renal scarring did not reach
statistical significance.

BACKGROUND: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is one of the most important risk factors
for urinary tract infection (UTI). Diagnosis and treatment of VUR is important to
prevent irreversible complications, such as renal scarring and chronic renal
failure. This study was conducted to assess the value of direct radionuclide
cystography (DRNC) in the detection of VUR in children with UTI and a normal
voiding cystourethrography (VCUG).
METHODS: DRNC was performed in 35 children with a normal VCUG after an episode of
febrile UTI who had hydronephrosis or hydroureter, abnormal acute
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan results and/or febrile UTI recurrence. This
study was conducted in the nephrology department of Mofid Children's Hospital,
Tehran (Iran).
RESULTS: The results were statistically analyzed. Among the 70 ureters studied,
33 (49.1 %) were observed to have VUR. Of these, 17 (51.5 %) had mild, 14 (42.4
%) moderate, and 2 (6.1 %) severe reflux. A significant relationship was observed
between DRNC results and DMSA renal scan findings (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we suggest that DRNC may reveal VUR despite a 
normal VCUG in children with hydronephrosis, abnormal acute DMSA, and/or
recurrent febrile UTI.

Effects of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles on genes in two
mouse cell lines.

Liu Y, Zou J, Wang X, Wang T, Wang J.

To evaluate the effects of iron oxide nanoparticles on genes from different cell 
lines in this study, mouse macrophage RAW264.7 and hepatocyte Hepa1-6 cell lines 
were treated with DMSA-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Two doses were used, 50
microg/mL and 100 microg/mL, respectively, for 24 hr and gene expression profile 
was detected by DNA microarrays. The gene expression patterns for the two cell
lines greatly differed from each other when compared, revealing distinct
cell-specific effects of the nanoparticles on the genes. It was found that the
nanoparticles significantly influenced expression of genes in the RAW264.7 cells,
showing complete difference from those of Hepa1-6 cells. More genes were
downregulated in the RAW264.7 cells by two doses of the nanoparticles but
up-regulated in the Hepa1-6 cells by two doses of the same nanoparticles.
Moreover, the increase of nanoparticle dose greatly decreased up-regulation of
genes but increased down-regulation of genes in the RAW264.7 cells. The influence
of nanoparticles did not result in similar effect in the Hepa1-6 cells. Apart
from the difference in gene expression patterns in the two cell lines, there were
eight and seven genes which were consistently down-regulated and up-regulated by 
low-dose and high-dose of nanoparticles in the two cell lines, respectively,
revealing the common effects of the nanoparticles on the genes in the two cell
lines. These common effects on genes were caused by homeostatic processes,
influenced by down-regulation of genes and immune responses, and also cell death,
influenced by up-regulation of genes. The data from this study has shed new
insights into the potential in vivo nanotoxicolgy of the DMSA-coated Fe3O4
nanoparticles.

There are different scoring systems available for determining the grade of breast
cancer malignancy. Breast cancer tumors have been described for grades 1-3 using 
the modified Nottingham-Bloom-Richardson grading system. Determining the grade is
very important for the clinicians to choose the best treatment options.
Technetium-99m methoxy isobutyl isonitrile ((99m)Tc-MIBI) and pentavalent
(99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc(V)-DMSA) scintigraphy have been used and
are under evaluation for being prognostic factors for breast carcinoma.
Radionuclide breast imaging not only visualizes the lesion site but also reflects
specific biological and functional lesion features, including perfusion,
proliferative potential, metabolic activity and receptor status.

Recurrent urinary tract infections in young children: role of DMSA scintigraphy
in detecting vesicoureteric reflux.

BACKGROUND: Performing micturiting cystourethrography (MCUG) in young children
with recurrent urinary tract infections is controversial with discrepancy among
the major guidelines.
OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that a normal dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scintigraphy may avoid the need of performing MCUG for detecting
vesicoureteric reflux in children with first febrile urinary tract infection.
However, the role of DMSA for ruling out vesicoureteric reflux in children with
recurrent urinary tract infections has not been studied.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Approval from institutional ethical review committee was
sought and the requirement of informed consent was waived. A total of 50 children
under the age of 10 years with recurrent urinary tract infections underwent MCUG 
scan within 3 months of DMSA scan from January 2011 to September 2012 at our
institution. Diagnosis of recurrent urinary tract infections and grading of
vesicoureteric reflux was according to previously established standards.
Abnormalities on DMSA scan - scarring, hydronephrosis and reduced differential
renal function - were compared with presence of vesicoureteric reflux on MCUG.
RESULTS: High-grade vesicoureteric reflux was noted on MCUG in 22 (44%) cases.
The findings on DMSA included hydronephrosis and scarring in 25 (50%) and 25
(50%) cases, respectively. Abnormalities on DMSA scan for detecting the presence 
of high-grade vesicoureteric reflux on MCUG examination had sensitivity,
specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 95.45%, 35.71%, 53.85%
and 90.91%, respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.48
and 0.13 respectively.
CONCLUSION: DMSA scan had high overall sensitivity and negative predictive value 
with a low negative likelihood ratio for ruling out high-grade vesicoureteric
reflux on MCUG, which may obviate the need of invasive MCUG along with its
associated drawbacks.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single endoscopic
injection of Vantris in young girls affected by primary vesicoureteral reflux
(VUR) at more than 2 years of prospective follow-up.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over the last 4 years, 73 girls with primary VUR of grades 
(G) I-IV underwent a single endoscopic injection of Vantris. The mean age was
8.48 (SD=4.8) years. VUR was unilateral in 73 and bilateral in 13 patients,
comprising 86 renal refluxing units (RRUs). Pre-operative evaluation consisted
of: blood biochemistry, urine analysis and culture, ultrasound scan, voiding
cystourethrogram (VCUG), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal isotope scan.
Patients were followed using ultrasound scans at 1 month and every 3 months for
the first year and then 2 years after injection. Direct radionuclide cystography 
with technetium pertechnetate was performed at 3 and 12 months after injection.
VCUG was performed only in confirmed cases of failure and downgraded VUR at 3,
12, and 24 months after endoscopic correction.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine (95%), 61 (83.4%), and 52 (71%) patients completed 3, 12, and
24 months' follow-up respectively. VUR was corrected and downgraded to G I in 81%
and 3.3% of RRUs at 3 months' follow-up. The corrected and downgraded RRUs at 12 
and 24 months' follow-up were 77%, 10%, and 77%, 11% respectively. De novo
contralateral G I VUR was demonstrated in 8.6% of normal ureters. Contralateral
GI VUR with normal DMSA isotope renal scans was resolved in 71% of RRUs. Febrile 
urinary tract infection decreased to 4.1% in the patients.
CONCLUSION: According to our study, a single Vantris injection provides a high
level of efficacy and safety in the treatment of primary G I-IV VUR in young
girls, at 2 years' prospective follow-up.

Iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles have been proposed for an increasing number of 
biomedical applications, such as drug delivery. To this end, toxicological
studies of their potent effects in biological media must be better evaluated. The
aim of this study was to synthesize, characterize, and examine the potential in
vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of thiolated (SH) and S-nitrosated (S-NO)
iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles toward healthy and cancer cell lines. 
Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by coprecipitation techniques and coated
with small thiol-containing molecules, such as mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) or
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The physical-chemical, morphological,
and magnetic properties of thiol-coating Fe3O4 nanoparticles were characterized
by different techniques. The thiol groups on the surface of the nanoparticles
were nitrosated, leading to the formation of S-nitroso-MSA- or
S-nitroso-DMSA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of
thiolated and S-nitrosated nanoparticles were more deeply evaluated in healthy
(3T3, human lymphocytes cells, and chinese hamster ovary cells) and cancer cell
lines (MCF-7). The results demonstrated that thiol-coating iron oxide magnetic
nanoparticles have few toxic effects in cells, whereas S-nitrosated-coated
particles did cause toxic effects. Moreover, due to the superaramagnetic behavior
of S-nitroso-Fe3O4 nanoparticles, those particles can be guided to the target
site upon the application of an external magnetic field, leading to local toxic
effects in the tumor cells. Taken together, the results suggest the promise of
S-nitroso-magnetic nanoparticles in cancer treatment.

Nanoencapsulation of DMSA monoester for better therapeutic efficacy of the
chelating agent against arsenic toxicity.

Yadav A, Mathur R, Samim M, Lomash V, Kushwaha P, Pathak U, Babbar AK, Flora SJ, 
Mishra AK, Kaushik MP.

AIMS: Exposure to toxic metals remains a widespread occupational and
environmental problem in world. Chelation therapy is a mainstream treatment used 
to treat heavy metal poisoning. This paper describes the synthesis,
characterization and therapeutic evaluation of monoisoamyl 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (MiADMSA)-encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles as a detoxifying agent for
arsenic poisoning.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Polymeric nanoparticles entrapping the DMSA monoester, which
can evade the reticulo-endothelial system and have a long circulation time in the
blood, were prepared. Particle characterization was carried out by transmission
electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. An in vivo study was conducted 
to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of MiADMSA-encapsulated polymeric
nanoparticles (nano- MiADMSA; 50 mg/kg orally for 5 days) and comparison drawn
with bulk MiADMSA. Swiss albino mice exposed to sodium arsenite for 4 weeks were 
treated for 5 days to evaluate alterations in blood, brain, kidney and liver
oxidative stress variables. The study also evaluated the histopathological
changes in tissues and the chelating potential of the nanoformulation.
RESULTS: Our results show that nano-MiADMSA have a narrow size distribution in
the 50-nm range. We observed an enhanced chelating potential of nano-MiADMSA
compared with bulk MiADMSA as evident in the reversal of biochemical changes
indicative of oxidative stress and efficient removal of arsenic from the blood
and tissues. Histopathological changes and urinary 8-OHdG levels also prove
better therapeutic efficacy of the novel formulation for arsenic toxicity.
CONCLUSION: The results from our study show better therapeutic efficacy of
nano-MiADMSA in removing arsenic burden from the brain and liver.

OBJECTIVE: It is critical to differentiate between a multicystic dysplastic
kidney (MCDK) and a kidney with severe hydronephrosis as the treatment varies
significantly. We designed a study to compare renal ultrasound (RUS) to nuclear
medicine (NM) scan in the diagnosis of MCDK, in order to determine if RUS can be 
used for the definitive diagnosis of MCKD without use of NM scan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of children with MCDK,
who underwent both a RUS and Tc-99m MAG3 or DMSA scan. We planned to calculate
the positive predictive value of an RUS diagnosis of MCDK, using NM scan
diagnosis of a nonfunctioning kidney as the gold standard.
RESULTS: The diagnosis of MCDK was made by RUS in 91 patients, 84 of whom had a
normal bladder US. NM confirmed the diagnosis of MCDK in all 84 of these patients
(100%).
CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated a high predictive value for RUS in the diagnosis
of MCDK. Our data support that in healthy infants with RUS diagnosis of
unilateral MCDK and normal bladder US, NM scan may be unnecessary to confirm the 
diagnosis.

It has been established that enhanced computed tomography (CT) and (99m)
Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy ((99m) Tc-DMSA scintigraphy) used
in conjunction with single-photon emission CT is a useful tool for the diagnosis 
of acute pyelonephritis (APN). The utility of non-enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), however, has not been investigated extensively for the diagnosis
of APN or renal abscess in children. We describe the case of a 23-month-old boy
with suspected APN who received non-enhanced MRI. Whole body diffusion-weighted
imaging (DWI) was used, and a background body-signal suppression sequence was
applied. High-intensity focal lesions were identified on DWI and low-intensity
lesions on the apparent diffusion coefficient map in the acute phase. This case
suggested that non-enhanced MRI could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of APN
in children, because it can avoid the risks of not only radiation exposure but
also nephrogenic systemic fibrosis associated with gadolinium-based contrast
agents, especially in infants.

In the present review we provide an update of the appropriate use of chelating
agents in the treatment of intoxications with compounds of mercury, lead and
copper. The relatively new chelators meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 
2,3-dimercapto-propanesulphonate (DMPS) can effectively mobilize deposits of
mercury as well as of lead into the urine. These drugs can be administered orally
and have relatively low toxicity compared to the classical antidote
dimercaptopropanol (BAL). d-Penicillamine has been widely used in copper
overload, although 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid or tetrathiomolybdate may be more 
suitable alternatives today. In copper-toxicity, a free radical scavenger might
be recommended as adjuvant to the chelator therapy.

Mercury poisoning cases have been reported in many parts of the world, resulting 
in many deaths every year. Mercury compounds are classified in different chemical
types such as elemental, inorganic and organic forms. Long term exposure to
mercury compounds from different sources e.g. water, food, soil and air lead to
toxic effects on cardiovascular, pulmonary, urinary, gastrointestinal,
neurological systems and skin. Mercury level can be measured in plasma, urine,
feces and hair samples. Urinary concentration is a good indicator of poisoning of
elemental and inorganic mercury, but organic mercury (e.g. methyl mercury) can be
detected easily in feces. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are a rapid, cheap and
sensitive method for detection of thymine bound mercuric ions. Silver
nanoparticles are used as a sensitive detector of low concentration Hg2+ ions in 
homogeneous aqueous solutions. Besides supportive therapy, British anti lewisite,
dimercaprol (BAL), 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA. succimer) and
dimercaptopropanesulfoxid acid (DMPS) are currently used as chelating agents in
mercury poisoning. Natural biologic scavengers such as algae, azolla and other
aquatic plants possess the ability to uptake mercury traces from the environment.

This work aimed to measure the in vivo quantification errors obtained when
ray-based iterative reconstruction is used in micro-single-photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT). This was investigated with an extensive
phantom-based evaluation and two typical in vivo studies using (99m)Tc and
(111)In, measured on a commercially available cadmium zinc telluride (CZT)-based 
small-animal scanner. Iterative reconstruction was implemented on the GPU using
ray tracing, including (1) scatter correction, (2) computed tomography-based
attenuation correction, (3) resolution recovery, and (4) edge-preserving
smoothing. It was validated using a National Electrical Manufacturers Association
(NEMA) phantom. The in vivo quantification error was determined for two
radiotracers: [(99m)Tc]DMSA in naive mice ( n = 10 kidneys) and
[(111)In]octreotide in mice ( n = 6) inoculated with a xenograft neuroendocrine
tumor (NCI-H727). The measured energy resolution is 5.3% for 140.51 keV
((99m)Tc), 4.8% for 171.30 keV, and 3.3% for 245.39 keV ((111)In). For (99m)Tc,
an uncorrected quantification error of 28 ± 3% is reduced to 8 ± 3%. For (111)In,
the error reduces from 26 ± 14% to 6 ± 22%. The in vivo error obtained with
"(m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid ([(99m)Tc]DMSA) is reduced from 16.2 ± 2.8% to
-0.3 ± 2.1% and from 16.7 ± 10.1% to 2.2 ± 10.6% with [(111)In]octreotide.
Absolute quantitative in vivo SPECT is possible without explicit system matrix
measurements. An absolute in vivo quantification error smaller than 5% was

AIM: To evaluate the predictive value of various clinical and laboratory
parameters on the identification of acute extensive and/or multifocal renal
involvement in children with febrile urinary tract infections (UTI).
METHODS: The medical records of 148 children (median age: 2.4 months, range:
11 days-24 months), who were admitted during a 3-year period with a first episode
of febrile UTI, were analysed. Acute dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA),
clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated.
RESULTS: Seventy six children (51%) had abnormal findings on the acute DMSA. Of
them, 20 had DMSA grade 2, while 56 had grade 3 and 4. Patients with a DMSA grade
3 and 4 were more likely to have shivering (OR 3.4), white blood count
(WBC) ≥ 18 000/μL (OR 2.4), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 9300/μL (OR 4.4),
C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 50 mg/L (OR 2.7) and procalcitonin (PCT) ≥ 1.64 ng/mL 
(OR diagnostic). There was a significant difference of WBC (p = 0.004), ANC, CRP 
and PCT levels (p < 0.001) between children with normal and grade 2 aDMSA versus 
those with aDMSA grade 3 and 4.
CONCLUSIONS: Shivering and elevated inflammatory markers increase the risk of
acute extensive and/or multifocal kidney involvement in children with febrile
UTI. Procalcitonin seems to be an excellent marker of the severity of acute
parenchymal involvement.

Longterm outcome of Macroplatique injection for treatment of vesicoureteral
reflux in children.

Mohamed EA, Shehata FH, Abdelbaset EA, Abdelkhalek MA(1), Abdelatif AH, Galal HA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Alazhar University, Cairo, Egypt.

BACKGROUND: This study examined our experience with one year follow-up of 20
cases of vesicoureteric reflux in children after treatment with Macroplastique ® 
injection.
PATIENT AND METHODS: A total of 20 children (31 ureters) with primary grades II
to V vesicoureteral reflux were treated with subureteral Macroplastique ®
injection from 2010 to 2011 and followed for an average of 12 months (range 3 to 
24). Vesicoureteral reflux was grade II in 3, III in 7, IV in 9 and V in 12
ureters. Each child underwent pre-operative voiding cystourethrography,
abdominopelvic ultrasound, urine analysis/culture, S. creatinine and CBC.
Dimercapto-succinic acid scan (DMSA scan) and magnetic resonance urography (MRU) 
were done in some patients. Voiding cystourethrography at 3 months was done to
rule out persistent reflux.
RESULTS: Overall, reflux was corrected in 11 (35.5%) ureters and 9 (45%) children
after a single injection. With repeat injection, reflux was corrected in 16
(51.6%) ureters and 11 (55%) children, reflux improved/downgrade in 4 (12.9%)
ureters and 2 (10%) children. Correction by grade was 100%, 100%, 9.7%, 9.7% for 
grades II to V, respectively. There were no surgical complications. None of the
cured patients had recurrent reflux during follow-up. There were 9 (45%) children
who required open ureteral re-implantation for failed injection.
CONCLUSION: Sub-ureteral Macroplastique ® injection therapy could be a primary
treatment for low grade VUR (grade III or less) in children because it is simple,
safe, effective, less invasive, decreased.

Single-photon emission CT using (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) for
characterization of suspected renal masses.

Grüning T(1), Drake BE, Freeman SJ.

Author information: 
(1)1 Department of Nuclear Medicine, Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, England, UK.

OBJECTIVE: A retrospective analysis of the clinical utility of
(99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) single photon emission CT (SPECT) for
characterization of suspected renal masses.
METHODS: 15 patients who had undergone (99m)Tc-DMSA SPECT were identified, and 13
patients also had SPECT/CT. (99m)Tc-DMSA uptake in the renal lesion was
characterized semiquantitatively. Other imaging tests, histology and clinical
data were available for correlation.
RESULTS: (99m)Tc-DMSA was not taken up in all five renal masses with histological
confirmation of malignancy (uptake 7-19% of normal renal tissue); in two further 
masses, which were clinically likely to be malignant; and in one indeterminate
mass (lack of sufficiently long follow-up). No renal malignancy was identified in
any of the seven patients whose renal masses had normal (99m)Tc-DMSA uptake
(41-130%).
CONCLUSION: Although caution with regard to applying those results in clinical
practice must be advised, owing to the retrospective nature of this report and
the small number of patients included, it seems that (99m)Tc-DMSA SPECT shows a
clinically useful diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing true renal masses (which
in many cases require surgery) from pseudomasses.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: (99m)Tc-DMSA SPECT is a clinically useful adjunct test for
characterization of suspected renal masses.

Use of a ray-based reconstruction algorithm to accurately quantify preclinical
microSPECT images.

Vandeghinste B, Van Holen R, Vanhove C, De Vos F, Vandenberghe S, Staelens S.

This work aimed to measure the in vivo quantification errors obtained when
ray-based iterative reconstruction is used in micro-single-photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT). This was investigated with an extensive
phantom-based evaluation and two typical in vivo studies using 99mTc and 111In,
measured on a commercially available cadmium zinc telluride (CZT)-based
small-animal scanner. Iterative reconstruction was implemented on the GPU using
ray tracing, including (1) scatter correction, (2) computed tomography-based
attenuation correction, (3) resolution recovery, and (4) edge-preserving
smoothing. It was validated using a National Electrical Manufacturers Association
(NEMA) phantom. The in vivo quantification error was determined for two
radiotracers: [99mTc]DMSA in naive mice (n  =  10 kidneys) and [111In]octreotide 
in mice (n  =  6) inoculated with a xenograft neuroendocrine tumor (NCI-H727).
The measured energy resolution is 5.3% for 140.51 keV (99mTc), 4.8% for 171.30
keV, and 3.3% for 245.39 keV (111In). For 99mTc, an uncorrected quantification
error of 28 ± 3% is reduced to 8 ± 3%. For 111In, the error reduces from 26 ± 14%
to 6 ± 22%. The in vivo error obtained with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
([99mTc]DMSA) is reduced from 16.2 ± 2.8% to -0.3 ± 2.1% and from 16.7 ± 10.1% to
2.2 ± 10.6% with [111In]octreotide. Absolute quantitative in vivo SPECT is
possible without explicit system matrix measurements. An absolute in vivo
quantification error smaller than 5% was achieved and exemplified for both
[99mTc]DMSA and [111In]octreotide.

Decreased concentrating capacity in children with febrile urinary tract infection
and normal 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan: does medullonephritis exist?

Reyes-Millán B.

Author information: 
(1)Pediatric Nephrology Section, "Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria" University
Hospital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain, vgarcianieto@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: Although 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan is considered the 
gold standard for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (AP), sometimes it
produces false results in children with clinical features of AP. There are no
studies on the comparison of the sensitivity of DMSA and concentrating capacity
test.
METHODS: Eighty-five infants with AP of less than one year old were studied to
evaluate whether they had real AP or not. Data were compared between infants with
an abnormal (group A, n=64) and those with a normal DMSA scan (group B, n=21)
respectively. A DDAVP test was performed for each infant.
RESULTS: All the infants in both groups presented a high level of C-reactive
protein and fever (≥38°C). There were no differences in clinical and analytical
variables except C-reactive protein level in the two groups. Both groups
exhibited a low urinary osmolality (87.5% in the group A vs. 85.7% in the group
B). The patients with normal DMSA and decreased concentrating capacity have some 
renal parenchymal damage and not only a lower urinary infection. Of the infants
with an abnormal DMSA scan, 33.9% showed renal scars after 6-12 months. No infant
with a normal DMSA scan showed scars. The biochemical variables in both groups of
infants were not related to vesicoureteral refl ux.
CONCLUSION: Infants with AP, normal DMSA scan and low concentrating capacity may 
be characterized by a localized infection in the medulla (medullonephritis) or by
a false negative DMSA scan.

[2-deoxy-D-glucose modified supermagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles enhance the
contrasting effect on MRI of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 tumor in nude mice].

University, Zhenjiang 212002, China. Email: xhongshan@hotmail.com.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) modified
supermagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) (γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs) in tumor
detection as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent.
METHODS: γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs was prepared. The degree of A549 cells targeted
absorption of γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs was detected by Prussian blue staining,
colorimetric assay, T2W and multi-echo sequence MRI. γ-Fe2O3@DMSA NPs was used as
a control agent, and free D-glucose as a competitive inhibitor. Human lung
adenocarcinoma A549 xenograft tumor was prepared in nude mice. Sterile aqueous
suspension of γ-Fe2O3@DMSA NPs or γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs was injected into the tail 
vein of nude mice. Before and 6, 12, 24, 48 h after injection, MRI imaging of the
mice was performed. T2 signal intensity of the tumor, brain, liver and thigh
skeletal muscles, and T2 values of the tumors were measured.
RESULTS: The average diameter of the particles was about 10 nm, and there were no
significant differences between the diameters of γ-Fe2O3@DMSA NPs and γ-
Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs. The IR spectra showed the C-N retractable vibration peak at
γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs surface, indicating that 2-DG was conjugated to the
γ-Fe2O3@DMSA NPs. The Prussian blue staining, colorimetric assay, MRI T2 signal
intensity and T2 values revealed that γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs were significantly more
absorbed by A549 cells at growth peak than γ-Fe2O3@DMSA NPs, and the absorption
of γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NP was inhibited by free D-glucose. The results of in vivo
examination showed that before and at 6, 12, 24, 48 h after injection of
γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs, the mean T2 signal intensities of the tumors were (326.00 ± 
16.26)s, (276.40 ± 5.13)s, (268.40 ± 30.58)s, (240.40 ± 25.93)s, (262.20 ±
30.04)s, respectively, and the T2 values of the tumors were (735.80 ± 20.93) ms, 
(645.80 ± 69.58) ms, (615.00 ± 124.61) ms, (570.60 ± 67.78) ms, and (537.80 ±
105.29) ms, respectively. However, before and at 6, 12, 24, 48 h after injection 
of γ-Fe2O3@DMSA NPs, the mean T2 signal intensities of the tumors were (335.60 ± 
4.93)s, (290.80 ± 5.93)s, (273.40 ± 15.08)s, (327.40 ± 16.65)s, and (313.20 ±
20.45)s, respectively, and T2 values were (686.00 ± 21.44)ms, (617.80 ± 69.93)ms,
(645.20 ± 85.89)ms, (669.40 ± 13.72)ms, and (608.80 ± 61.90)ms, respectively. The
T2 signal intensity and T2 value of the tumors were not declined generally after 
injection. The liver T2 signal intensity was decreased after injection of both
γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs and γ-Fe2O3@DMSA NPs, and T2 signal intensity of the brain
and muscle did not show significant changes.
CONCLUSIONS: γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs has an ability to target glucose receptors
overexpressed in tumors, and may serve as a MRI contrast agent for tumor
detection.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the variability in the
interpretation of parenchymal abnormalities and to assess the differences in
interpretation of routine renal scintigraphic findings on posterior view of
technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (pvDMSA) scans and parenchymal phase of
technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine (ppMAG3) scans by using standard
criterions to make standardization and semiquantitative evaluation and to have
more accurately correlation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians independently 
interpreted pvDMSA scans of 204 and ppMAG3 scans of 102 pediatric patients,
retrospectively. Comparisons were made by visual inspection of pvDMSA scans, and 
ppMAG3 scans by using a grading system modified from Itoh et al. According to
this, anatomical damage of the renal parenchyma was classified into six types:
Grade 0-V. In the calculation of the agreement rates, Kendall correlation (tau-b)
analysis was used.
RESULTS: According to our findings, excellent agreement was found for DMSA grade 
readings (DMSA-GR) (tau-b = 0.827) and good agreement for MAG3 grade readings
(MAG3-GR) (tau-b = 0.790) between two observers. Most of clear parenchymal
lesions detected on pvDMSA scans and ppMAG3 scans identified by observers
equally. Studies with negative or minimal lesions reduced correlation degrees for
both DMSA-GR and MAG3-GR.
CONCLUSION: Our grading system can be used for standardization of the reports. We
conclude that standardization of criteria and terminology in the interpretations 
may result in higher interobserver consistency, also improve low interobserver
reproducibility and objectivity of renal scintigraphy reports.

Application of hydrophobically modified water-soluble polymers for the dispersion
of hydrophobic magnetic nanoparticles in aqueous media.

Hydrophobically modified water-soluble polymers (HMWSPs), comprised of a
poly(sodium methacrylate) (PMANa) or poly(sodium acrylate) (PANa) backbone and
pendent dodecyl methacrylate (DMA) or dodecyl acrylamide (DAAm) chains,
respectively, were synthesized. The hydrophobic content of the copolymers,
P(MANa-co-DMA) and P(ANa-co-DAAm), is in the range of 0 to 25 mol%, while their
weight-average molar mass varies from ~10 000 up to ~75 000. Their self-assembly 
behavior in dilute aqueous solution was followed through Nile Red probing, DLS
and TEM measurements. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) is mainly
controlled by the hydrophobic content and not the molar mass of the copolymers.
Above CMC, spherical and large-compound micelles are identified by DLS and TEM.
Moreover, oleylamine coated CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (CoFe2O4@OAm MNPs) of 9.4 nm
with a saturation magnetization Ms = 85 emu g(-1) were solvothermally prepared.
The hydrophobic CoFe2O4@OAm MNPs were successfully encapsulated into the
hydrophobic cores of the structures formed by the copolymers above CMC through a 
solvent mixing procedure, and in that way hydrophilic CoFe2O4@HMWSP nanohybrids
resulted. For comparison purposes, two alternate phase transfer approaches were
also used to convert CoFe2O4@OAm MNPs to hydrophilic ones: (a) addition of a
coating layer by cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and (b) by the ligand
exchange procedure with 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). NMR transverse
relaxivity measurements of the aqueous suspensions of CoFe2O4@P(ANa-co-DAAm),
CoFe2O4@CTAB and CoFe2O4@DMSA were recorded and the r2 relaxivity was determined.
CoFe2O4@CTAB demonstrated the highest r2 relaxivity of 554.0 mM(-1) s(-1), while 
CoFe2O4@P(ANa-co-DAAm) and CoFe2O4@DMSA showed lower values of 313.6 mM(-1) s(-1)
and 76.3 mM(-1) s(-1), respectively.

College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

PURPOSE: To compare intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion weight imaging
IVIM-DWI MRI with DMSA for the evaluation of cortical defect in pediatric upper
urinary tract infection (UTI) patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three kidneys of 22 pediatric patients with the
first episode of febrile upper UTI were evaluated. DWI using IVIM model was
performed with eight b factors. The presence of cortical defect was evaluated on 
apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. DMSA was used as the standard of
reference. ADC, true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudo-diffusion coefficient
(D*), and perfusion fraction (F) in both defect and nondefect area were
calculated and compared.
RESULTS: Cortical defects were detected in 14 kidneys by IVIM-DWI. The
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive
value of IVIM-DWI MRI for the detection of defects was 93.3%, 100%, 100%, and
96.5%, respectively. Mean values of ADC, D, D*, and F were 1.12 ± 0.15, 1.05 ±
0.10, 33 ± 17 (× 10(-3) mm(2) /s), and 0.14 ± 0.09 in the defect foci. In normal 
foci, ADC, D, D*, and F were 1.37 ± 0.09, 1.31 ± 0.10, 43 ± 19 (× 10(-3) mm(2)
/s), and 0.12 ± 0.04, respectively. ADC and D were significantly lower in defect 
group than nondefect group (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: IVIM-DWI can allow both direct visualization and quantitative
measurement of cortical defects.

Urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) level can predict acute renal
damage in young children with urinary tract infection.

Chien JW(1), Wang LY, Cheng YS, Tsai YG, Liu CS.

Author information: 
(1)Departments of Pediatrics .

BACKGROUND: There are no good biomarkers to predict renal parenchymal involvement
in children with urinary tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: Children (N = 73) younger than 5 years with UTI were enrolled. Urinary
levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and total antioxidant capacity
(TAC) were checked as markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity,
respectively. Tc99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy was used to
find evidence of renal involvement.
RESULTS: Patients with positive DMSA findings had higher levels of urinary
8-oxodG (p = 0.003) and higher urinary TAC (p = 0.001) than patients with normal 
DMSA findings.
CONCLUSIONS: High level of urinary 8-oxodG may be a risk factor of severe renal
damage.

Isolation and structural characterization of a silver-platinum nanocluster,
Ag4Pt2(DMSA)4.

Pennsylvania 16802, United States.

We report the synthesis, isolation, and characterization of the ligand-protected 
bimetallic cluster, Ag4Pt2(DMSA)4 (DMSA = meso-2,3,-dimercaptosuccinic acid). The
procedure is similar to the one employed for the synthesis of Ag4Ni2(DMSA)4.
Theoretical studies suggest that the Pt and Ni atoms have square planar
configurations. Because the crystal field splitting of 5d orbitals is typically
larger than that for 3d orbitals, the Pt-based cluster has an optical spectrum
that is significantly blue-shifted as compared to the Ni-based cluster.

The effect of ligands on FePt-Fe3O4 core-shell magnetic nanoparticles.

Kim DH, Tamada Y, Ono T, Bader SD, Rozhkova EA, Novosad V.

FePt-Fe3O4 core-shell nanoparticles functionalized with 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid (DOPAC) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) ligands were synthesized and
characterized. We found that the DOPAC ligand enhances the magnetic properties of
the FePt-Fe3O4 particles, in comparison with the DMSA ligand, which induces the
oxidation of the shell layer that causes a significant reduction of the
saturation magnetization. The synthesized magnetic nanoparticles were evaluated
for applications in magnetic hyperthermia and magnetic resonance imaging contrast
enhancement.

Gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles increase therapeutic efficacy of combination with
paclitaxel and anti-ABCG2 monoclonal antibody on multiple myeloma cancer stem
cells in mouse model.

Yang C, He X, Song L, Zhan X, Zhang Y, Dou J, Gu N.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be responsible for the relapse of
multiple myeloma (MM). The objective of this study was to target therapy of MM
cancer stem cells using gamma-Fe2O3@DMSA magnetic nanoparticle combination with
paclitaxel and anti-ABCG2 monoclonal antibody, and to evaluate the combined
therapeutic efficacy. CSCs were isolated from human MM cell line RPMI 8226 based 
on negative expression of CD138 and CD34. In vivo and in vitro studies
demonstrated that the isolated CD138-CD34- cells displayed certain stem cell
characteristics, including significant increase in expression of ABCG2
transporter, proliferation, mobility, drug resistance, clonogenic potential in
soft agar media and tumorigenecity in mice. Treatment with nanoparticles,
paclitaxel and anti-ABCG2 antibody remarkably inhibited the growth of CD138-CD34-
cells in vitro and their derived tumors in xenografts. The inhibition was also
correlated with elevated expression of caspase-9, caspase-8 and caspase-3, and
down-regulation of NF-KB. Our data indicate that the nanoparticle combination
with paclitaxel and anti-ABCG2 monoclonal antibody offers an effective approach
to treatment of MM CSCs through an apoptotic pathway.

Antitumor efficacy of DMSA modified Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles combined with
arsenic trioxide and adriamycin in Raji cells.

Cai X, Cai X, Wang C, Chen B, Hua W, Shen F, Yu L, He Z, Shi Y, Chen Y, Xia G,
Bao W, Zhang Y, Wang X.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the anticancer efficacy of 
dimercaptosuccinic acid modified iron oxide (DMSA-Fe3O4) magnetic nanoparticles
(MNPs) combined with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) and doxorubicin (ADM) in
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cell line (Raji cells). The growth inhibition rate
of Raji cells was determined by MTT assay. Characteristics of DMSA-Fe3O4 MNPs and
distribution of nanoparticles taken up by Raji cells were observed under a
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Further, apoptosis of cells and
intracellular concentration of ADM were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). DAPI
staining was used to view apoptotic cellular morphology. Subsequently,
transcription and protein expression levels of bcl-2, NFKB, survivin, bax, p53
and caspase-3 were determined by reverse transciptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and Western blotting analysis, respectively. The results of MTT assay
indicated that the inhibition of Raji cells by the combined form of ADM and As2O3
was significantly higher than either ADM or As2O3 alone. However, ADM-As2O3 MNPs 
proved superior over all other groups. TEM observation revealed that the majority
of MNPs were quasi-spherical with an average diameter of about 18 nm and the MNPs
taken up by cells were located in the endosome vesicles of cytoplasm. The
apoptotic rate and accumulation of intracellular ADM in ADM-As2O3 MNPs group were
significantly higher than those in control, ADM, As2O3 and ADM+As2O3, groups. In 
addition, DAPI staining of Raji cells from ADM-As,O3 MNPs group clearly exhibited
more morphological changes (severe structural alterations) than other groups.
Moreover, transcription and protein expression of bcl-2, NFKB, survivin, bax, p53
and caspase-3 of Raji cells were regulated at the most remarkable extent in
ADM-As2O3, MNPs group as compared with other groups. These findings suggest that 
the antitumor efficacy of the combination of novel ADM-As2O3, MNPs on Raji cells 
would be a promising strategy for lymphoma therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of imaging modalities on the evaluation and
prognosis of children with multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) disease.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all children with MCDK
diagnosed from 2004 until 2012 was performed. The study included 63 patients for 
whom all postnatal imaging modalities were available: renal bladder ultrasound
(RBUS), dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA) and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). 
Cases with major congenital abnormalities or incomplete data were excluded.
Abnormalities in the contralateral kidney and the fate of MCDK were also
addressed.
RESULTS: At diagnosis, the average age was four-and-a-half months. The majority
of cases were detected antenatally (87%). Postnatal RBUS and DMSA scans
established the diagnosis of MCDK in 92% and 98% of patients, respectively. DMSA 
showed photopenic areas in the contralateral kidneys in 10% of patients; all of
them had hydronephrosis and were confirmed to have vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
Contralateral VUR was detected in 16 patients; 63% of them had hydronephrosis.
After a mean follow-up of three-and-a-half years, involution occurred in 62% of
patients and the involution rate was inversely proportional to the initial size.
CONCLUSIONS: The classical appearance of MCDK on RBUS was sufficient to establish
the diagnosis in most patients. DMSA scan was more accurate in confirming the
diagnosis and evaluating the contralateral kidney. Selective screening for VUR in
patients with contralateral hydronephrotic kidney should be considered.

Depicting medullary thyroid cancer recurrence: the past and the future of nuclear
medicine imaging.

Skoura E(1).

Author information: 
(1)Nuclear Medicine Department, Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece.

CONTEXT: Inherited and sporadic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is an uncommon and
medically challenging malignancy. Even if the extent of initial surgery is deemed
adequate, the recurrence rate remains high, up to 50% in most series. Measurement
of serum calcitonin is important in the follow-up of patients with MTC, and
reliably reflects the existence of the disease.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: There is no single sensitive diagnostic imaging method to
reveal all MTC recurrences or metastases. Conventional morphologic imaging
methods (U/S, CT, and MRI) and several methods of nuclear medicine have been used
for this purpose with variable accuracy.
RESULTS: The main role of nuclear medicine imaging is the detection of residual
or recurrent tumor in the postoperative follow-up. In this review we present the 
radiopharmaceuticals used in the diagnosis of MTC recurrence, and comparison
among them.
CONCLUSIONS: The most used radiopharmaceuticals labelled with γ emitters are:
Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), labelled with (131)I or (123)I,
(111)In-pentetreotide (Octreoscan), 99mTc-pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid
((99m)Tc(V)-DMSA), and (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-Tyr3-Octreotide ( Tektrotyd). The
radiopharmaceuticals labelled with a positron-emitting radionuclide (β+),
suitable for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging are:
(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG), (18)F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine
(18F-DOPA), and 68Ga-labelled somatostatin analogues (68Ga-DOTATATE or DOTATOC).

AIMS: To study additional benefits of performing Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid
(Tc-99m-DMSA) scintigraphy as part of the follow-up of adults with spinal
dysraphism (SD), compared with ultrasonography, with regard to finding renal
scarring and difference in split renal function.
METHODS: Between January 2011 and April 2013 every patient visiting our
specialized outpatient clinic for adults with SD was invited to undergo both
renal ultrasonography and Tc-99m-DMSA scintigraphy. Outcomes of both modalities
were compared, with focus on renal scarring. The relation between renal scarring 
and hypertension was also assessed.
RESULTS: In total, 122 patients (with 242 renal units) underwent both renal
scintigraphy and ultrasonography. More scars were seen on DMSA scintigraphy than 
on ultrasonography: 45.9% vs. 10.3% of renal units; P < 0.001. Renal scarring
seen on DMSA was associated with the presence of hypertension (P = 0.049) whereas
scarring seen on ultrasonography was not (P = 0.10). If ultrasonography was
difficult to interpret, many more scars were missed on ultrasonography (78.9%)
compared with easily interpretable ultrasonographic images (30.6%; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In adults with SD, ultrasonography is of value to diagnose
dilatation and stones of the upper urinary tract; however, compared with DMSA
renography, renal scars are often missed, especially when the ultrasound is
difficult to interpret.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term urinary tract infection (UTI) rates after
endoscopic correction of vesicoureteral reflux and the possible risk factors for 
urinary infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of patients who underwent endoscopic
management of vesicoureteral reflux at a single institution from 2001 to 2011 was
performed. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 1 year. Voiding
cystourethrograms were completed 3 months postoperatively. UTI questionnaire
pertaining to the patient's UTI history before and after the surgery was mailed
to each patient. Data were first evaluated looking only at culture-confirmed
UTIs, and a second analysis included all patient-reported and culture-confirmed
urinary infections. Factors considered in the analysis included sex, age,
preoperative dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, reflux on postoperative voiding
cystourethrogram, voiding dysfunction, and preoperative reflux grade.
RESULTS: Data on 175 patients for a minimum of 1 year were collected. There were 
34 of 175 confirmed UTIs after endoscopic management, and 11 confirmed febrile
UTIs. There were no significant predictors of febrile or afebrile UTIs in this
group. Fifty-three of 175 patients (30%) experienced any UTI, 19 of which were
febrile (10%). In this group, recurrent reflux was the only significant predictor
of UTI (P=.03) and febrile UTIs (P=.04). Patients with more UTIs preoperatively
were more likely to have a postoperative febrile UTI.
CONCLUSION: Rates of UTI and febrile UTI in endoscopic management are similar and
no better than those for open ureteral reimplantation. Longer follow-up suggests 
an association of recurrent reflux and preoperative UTI rates as predictors of
postoperative febrile UTIs. These patients benefit from closer postoperative
observation.

Clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy for occult vesicoureteral reflux in
females: preliminary results of a retrospective case series.

Pichler R(1), Heidegger I, Schlenck B, Horninger W, Oswald J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Medical University of Innsbruck , Innsbruck , Austria.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome after
endoscopic therapy by injection of bulking agent in the treatment of occult
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) [no VUR on standard voiding cystourethrography
(VCUG), but positive (99m)Tc-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan] in females 
who have recurrent febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A case series was retrospectively identified of 24 females 
(mean age 15.5 years) with negative VCUG, but renal scars in one (n = 4) or both 
(n = 20) kidneys on DMSA scan. Endoscopic injection was performed bilaterally in 
20 (83.3%) and unilaterally in four patients (16.7%). The incidence of
postoperative UTIs was documented with a mean follow-up of 2.5 years (range 1-6
years).
RESULTS: The mean renal part function (DMSA scan) on the left and right sides was
53.5% (15-74%) and 47.3% (26-85%), respectively. Twenty-one out of 24 patients
(87.5%) showed no evidence of any febrile UTIs postoperatively. One patient
(4.2%) experienced a further febrile UTI 6 months after treatment. Two other
patients (8.3%) had one questionable afebrile UTI, 4 and 3 years after therapy.
Pressure-flow electromyography confirmed a dysfunctional voiding pattern in 12
patients (50%) treated with pelvic floor therapy and behavioural interventions
before endoscopic therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Injection of bulking agent seems to be a suitable treatment for
occult VUR in females to prevent further febrile UTIs. Patients with occult VUR
should undergo a careful evaluation of possible urodynamic disorders such as
dysfunctional voiding. These findings should be studied in prospective trials
before drawing any conclusions.

Booali-Sina Hospital, Booali-Sina Street, Po Box 3413786165, Qazvin, Iran.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the 
quantitative C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and
white blood cell (WBC) count in urinary tract infections (UTI) among hospitalised
infants and children in Qazvin, Iran.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 127 hospitalised children
ranging in age from 2 months to 12 years old 31.79 months (SD 30.73) who were
suspected of having a UTI and who did not receive antibiotics prior to being seen
at a Qazvin teaching children's hospital between 2005 and 2006. A urine analysis 
(U/A) and urine culture (U/C) were performed. The blood was taken for CRP, ESR
and WBC analyses. U/C has been considered the gold standard test for a UTI and
dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy (DMSA) as the gold standard for an
upper UTI (pyelonephritis). These tests were used to determine the diagnostic
accuracy, which is represented as the percent of correct results.
RESULTS: Within the study population, 72 patients (56.7%) were younger than two
years old 9.86 months (SD 4.56) and 55 (43.3%) were older than two years old
63.58 months (SD 30.96). One hundred and two patients (80.3%) were female. There 
were 100 cases that had a positive U/C. Of the patients with a positive U/C, 81
had pyuria (WBC more than 5/hpf), 71 had a peripheral WBC count of more than 10
000 /mL, 95 had a CRP of more than 10 mg/L and 82 had an ESR > 10 mm/h. The
sensitivity and specificity as well as the positive and negative predictive
values and the accuracy of CRP when using U/C as the gold standard were,
respectively, 96%, 11.1%, 80.2%, 50%, and 78%; when using ESR as the gold
standard were, respectively, 55%, 40%, 77.6%, 17.2%, and 52%; and when using WBC 
counts as the gold standard were, respectively, 69%, 52%, 86.6%, 35.6%, and 65%. 
The accuracy of CRP, ESR and WBC counts when considering the DMSA as the gold
standard were 58.3%, 62.8%, and 64.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although acute phase reactants can help in the diagnosis of a UTI,
they are not pathognomonic. CRP, ESR and WBC were neither completely sensitive
nor specific for detecting a UTI and its localisation site in Iranian children.
Therefore, in a country where advanced clinical diagnostic tests are available,
the advanced test should be used in conjunction with CRP, ESR and WBC analyses.
Finally, a combination of laboratory tests along with history and exact clinical 
examination are needed for the diagnosis of a UTI and its localisation site.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of hydroalcoholic extract of A. muricata on
biodistribution of two radiopharmaceuticals: sodium phytate and
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), both labeled with 99mtechnetium.
METHODS: Twenty four Wistar rats were divided into two treated groups and two
controls groups. The controls received water and the treated received 25mg/kg/day
of A. muricata by gavage for ten days. One hour after the last dose, the first
treated group received 99mTc-DMSA and the second sodium 99mTc-phytate (0.66MBq
each group), both via orbital plexus. Controls followed the same protocol. Forty 
min later, all groups were sacrificed and the blood, kidney and bladder were
isolated from the first treated group and the blood, spleen and liver isolated
from the second treated group. The percentage of radioactivity per gram of tissue
(%ATI/g) was calculated using a gamma counter.
RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed that there was a statistically
significant decrease (p<0.05) in the uptake of %ATI/g in bladder
(0.11±0.01and1.60±0.08), kidney (3.52±0.51and11.84±1.57) and blood (0.15±0.01and 
0.54±0.05) between the treated group and control group, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The A. muricata hydroalcoholic extract negatively influenced the
uptake of 99mTc-DMSA in bladder, kidney and blood of rats.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of everolimus and tacrolimus
pretreatments on renal morphology and function in a rat ischemia reperfusion
(I/R) model. Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to
saline + sham operation, saline + I/R (IR), tacrolimus + I/R (TRL + I/R) and
everolimus + I/R (ERL + I/R) groups. Saline and active treatments were
administered intraperitoneally for seven consecutive days before the surgery. The
suprarenal aorta was clamped to achieve warm ischemia, except in the sham group. 
Right nephrectomy was performed in all animals and histology was examined. Renal 
function was assessed on post-operative Day 7 by Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scintigraphy, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and serum biochemistry.
Both everolimus and tacrolimus preserved serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen
levels, but only everolimus preserved GFR (0.74 ± 0.36, 1.20 ± 0.37 and 2.24 ±
0.32 mL/min for I/R, TRL + I/R and ERL + I/R, respectively, P < 0.001). %ID
values for sham, I/R, TRL + I/R and ERL + I/R were 55 ± 3, 47 ± 4, 45 ± 6 and 62 
± 7 (P < 0.001). On histologic evaluation, ERL + I/R showed less tubular damage
and necrosis than I/R, as well as TRL + I/R. Within the confines of this rat warm
ischemia model, everolimus pre-treatment was useful in preserving renal function 
following I/R injury. The possibility of using everolimus as a pre-conditioning
agent for I/R injury in kidney transplantation should be further explored.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, NHS Greater Glasgow
and Clyde, G4 0SF, UK.

DMSA imaging is carried out in nuclear medicine to assess the level of functional
renal tissue in patients. This study investigated the use of an artificial neural
network to perform diagnostic classification of these scans. Using the
radiological report as the gold standard, the network was trained to classify
DMSA scans as positive or negative for defects using a representative sample of
257 previously reported images. The trained network was then independently tested
using a further 193 scans and achieved a binary classification accuracy of 95.9%.
The performance of the network was compared with three qualified expert observers
who were asked to grade each scan in the 193 image testing set on a six point
defect scale, from 'definitely normal' to 'definitely abnormal'. A receiver
operating characteristic analysis comparison between a consensus operator,
generated from the scores of the three expert observers, and the network revealed
a statistically significant increase (α < 0.05) in performance between the
network and operators. A further result from this work was that when suitably
optimized, a negative predictive value of 100% for renal defects was achieved by 
the network, while still managing to identify 93% of the negative cases in the
dataset. These results are encouraging for application of such a network as a
screening tool or quality assurance assistant in clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is an autosomal dominant disorder
caused by a gene deletion on chromosome 7q11.23. Patients with WBS usually show a
group of features such as developmental delay, cardiovascular anomalies, mental
retardation, and characteristic facial appearance. Abdominal wall defects,
external genitalia anomalies, and structural abnormalities of the urinary tract
have been scarcely evaluated and were the focus of our study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 41 boys and 38 girls with WBS, 
with a mean age of 8.8 ± 4.1 (range 3-19 years). All patients were examined for
the evaluation of inguinal and umbilical hernias and genital anomalies. All
patients were offered a radiological evaluation, including urinary tract
ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram, and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal
scintigraphy (DMSA scan).
RESULTS: Of the 41 boys, 30 (73.1%) had abnormalities on physical examination,
including bilateral undescended testis in 13 (31.7%), retractile testis in four
(9.7%), hypospadias in four (9.7%), and unilateral cryptorchidism in three (7.3%)
patients. Of the 38 female subjects, 17 (44.7%) had at least one abnormality,
including umbilical hernia in 11 (28.9%), unilateral inguinal hernia in four
(10.5%), and bilateral inguinal hernia in three (7.8%) patients. Uroradiological 
abnormalities were found in 41 patients (51.9%). On sonography, six (7.6%)
patients had unilateral hydronephrosis, three (3.8%) had a duplicated collecting 
system, and two (2.5%) had kidney stones. On DMSA, performed in 36 patients, four
(11.1%) had unilateral renal scarring and two (5.5%) had bilateral renal
scarring. Cystourethrography was obtained from 56 patients, of whom 27 (48.2%)
had bladder diverticulum, 18 (32.1%) had bladder wall trabeculation, and three
(5.3%) had vesicoureteral reflux. We found no association of urological
abnormalities with cardiovascular defects.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with WBS have a high prevalence of abdominal wall, external
genitalia, and urological abnormalities, emphasizing the importance of proper
physical examination and radiological investigation in this population.

PURPOSE: Renal size is an important indicator to determine adequate organ growth 
in children. The aim of this study was to estimate renal size with Technesium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and propose a simple formula for predicting
renal length in normal Korean children.
METHODS: This study included 346 children (148 boys and 198 girls; age range, 1
month to 17 years) in whom renal length was measured using the DMSA scan.
Patients with anatomical renal abnormalities or acute pyelonephritis were
excluded. Children were divided into two groups: 214 children (61.8%) were less
than a year old (group 1) and 132 (38.2%) were ≥1 year (group 2).
RESULTS: Renal length was larger on the left side than the right side, and there 
was no significant gender-related difference in renal length. We propose the
following formula for renal length based on the analysis of the 346 children in
our study: the formula was as follows: 4.682×age (month)(0.137), R(2) =0.780. In 
group 1, the formula was renal length (cm)=0.127×age (month)+5.144, R(2) =0.354, 
and in group 2, the formula was 0.334×age (year)+6.477, R(2) =0.829.
CONCLUSION: It is difficult to establish simple formulae in infants (R(2)
=0.354). Therefore, further studies including relevant variables are needed for
this age group. We proposed formulae to estimate renal length in Korean children 
over 1 year of age by using the DMSA scan.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens are emerging as a
cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) worldwide. In this matched-case control
study, clinical characteristics and associated risk factors for ESBL UTI were
evaluated. In a total of 463 positive urine cultures, 48 (10.4%) (from 39
patients, 23 boys) were phenotypically ESBL-producing bacteria. The most
frequently isolated microorganism was , followed by Klebsiella spp. and
Enterobacter cloacae. Children with ESBL UTI (n=39) were on prophylaxis more (21%
vs. 6%, p=0.01), had higher rates of urinary tract anomalies (36% vs. 10%,
p=0.0007), presented abnormal 99m Tcdimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) findings (i.e.
scars) (23% vs. 4%, p=0.001), and had longer hospitalization (9.8 vs. 7.4 days,
p=0.004) compared to those with non-ESBL UTI (n=117). The recognition of risk
factors for UTI caused by ESBL bacteria in children may aid in the identification
of high-risk cases and may enable proper management of these patients.

(99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid [DMSA(III)] and colloidal human serum albumin
((99m)Tc-nanocolloid) are widely used radiopharmaceuticals. Recently, in our
institution we encountered image quality problems in DMSA scans after changing
the brand of syringes we were using, which triggered us to look into the
adsorption properties of syringes from different brands for (99m)Tc-DMSA(III) and
(99m)Tc-nanocolloid. We also describe a clinical case in which adsorption of
(99m)Tc-DMSA(III) caused inferior imaging quality. DMSA and nanocolloid were
labeled with (99m)Tc following manufacturer guidelines. After synthesis, syringes
with (99m)Tc-DMSA(III) and (99m)Tc-nanocolloid were stored for 15, 30, 60, and
120 min. We evaluated Luer Lock syringes manufactured by different brands such as
Artsana, Henke-Sass-Wolf, B. Braun Medical N.V., CODAN Medizinische Geräte GmbH &
Co KG, Becton Dickinson and Company, and Terumo Europe. Adsorption of
(99m)Tc-DMSA(III) and (99m)Tc-nanocolloid was acceptably low for all syringes
(<13%), except for two brands with (99m)Tc-DMSA(III) adsorption rates of 36 and
30%, respectively, and for one brand with a (99m)Tc-nanocolloid adsorption rate
of 27%. Adsorption of (99m)Tc-DMSA(III) and (99m)Tc-nanocolloid reaches critical 
levels in syringes produced by two brands, potentially causing poor image
quality--for example, in DMSA scans using pediatric radiopharmaceutical doses. It
is advised to check the compatibility of any radiopharmaceutical with syringes as
an integral part of the quality assurance program.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lead poisoning is normally caused by repeated
occupational inhalation of lead. However, lead may also be absorbed through the
digestive route. Some alternative medical treatments, such as Ayurvedic medicine,
can also contain lead and may result in poisoning.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: We collected cases of lead poisoning related to Ayurvedic
treatments attended at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona.
RESULTS: Two female patients, aged 45 and 57 years, respectively, who initiated
Ayurvedic treatments which involved the ingestion of various medicaments, were
included. The first patient presented with anemia and abdominal pain. The lead
level was 74μg/dL and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin was 163μg/dL. She was
treated with intravenous calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(CaNa2EDTA) and later with oral dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) with a good
evolution. The second patient presented with abdominal pain and a Burton's line. 
The lead level was 52μg/dL and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin was 262μg/dL. She 
was treated with oral DMSA and evolved favorably. Lead concentrations in some of 
the tablets supplied to the patients reached 2,003 and 19,650μg/g of tablet.
CONCLUSIONS: Lead poisoning may result from treatments based on Ayurvedic
medicine and may reach epidemic proportions. Health control of alternative
medicines is necessary.

with vesicoureteral reflux.

BACKGROUND: The detection of renal scars is of paramount importance for optimal
clinical management of patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) and
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy of 
unenhanced magnetic resonance urography (MRU) and Tc-99(m) dimercaptosuccinic
acid (Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy to dectect renal scars.
METHODS: Unenhanced MRU and Tc-DMSA scintigraphy were performed in 49 children
(10 boys, 39 girls; mean age 7.4 ± 4.2 years, range 1-15 years) with documented
VUR. MR imaging scans were obtained within 7 days after voiding cystourethrogram 
(VCUG) and Tc-DMSA scintigraphy. The diagnostic performance of MRU in renal scar 
detection was calculated relative to that of the Tc-DMSA scan.
RESULTS: The renal scar detection rate of Tc-DMSA scintigraphy and unenhanced MRU
in kidneys with VUR was 32.4 and 25.9%, respectively. The sensitivity and
specificity of MRU in the detection of renal scars was 80 and 82.6% in kidneys
with VUR, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in
lesion detection between MRU and Tc-DMSA scintigraphy (P > 0.05). MRU and Tc-DMSA
scintigraphy showed good agreement (κ = 0.60).
CONCLUSIONS: Unenhanced MRU is a robust technique for the morphologic assessment 
of the urinary system and detection of renal scars. The lack of radiation and
contrast material makes this technique a much safer alternative to scintigraphy
in children with VUR, particularly in those who require follow-up scanning and,
consequently, considerable radiation exposure.

DmsD is a chaperone of the redox enzyme maturation protein family specifically
required for biogenesis of DMSO reductase in Escherichia coli. It exists in
multiple folding forms, all of which are capable of binding its known substrate, 
the twin-arginine leader sequence of the DmsA catalytic subunit. It is important 
for maturation of the reductase and targeting to the cytoplasmic membrane for
translocation. Here, we demonstrate that DmsD exhibits an irreversible
photobleaching phenomenon upon 280 nm excitation irradiation. The phenomenon is
due to quenching of the tryptophan residues in DmsD and is dependent on its
folding and conformation. We also show that a tryptophan residue involved in DmsA
signal peptide binding (W87) is important for photobleaching of DmsD. Mutation of
W87, or binding of the DmsA twin-arginine signal peptide to DmsD in the pocket
that includes W72, W80, and W91 significantly affects the degree of
photobleaching. This study highlights the advantage of a photobleaching
phenomenon to study protein folding and conformation changes within a protein
that was once considered unusable in fluorescence spectroscopy.

According to the literature, febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among
the most common severe bacterial infections occurring in childhood, with
potential serious long-term consequences. In recent years, there have been
significant developments in our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical
and laboratory issues of febrile UTIs. Studies are focusing on the role of
predisposing host factors related to genes regulating immune response,
inflammation and fibrosis in the development of acute renal damage and subsequent
processes leading to renal scars. All the available guidelines underline the
importance of a correct diagnosis of febrile UTI to allow a more rational use of 
antibiotics and imaging. As a consequence, a shift from aggressive imaging
studies to a more restrictive and targeted approach has been recently observed.
Regarding the prognosis of febrile UTI, the introduction of prenatal ultrasound
studies revealed that a great portion of the alterations at imaging (and thus of 
the clinical complications), previously attributed to postinfection scarring,
were because of congenital kidney and urinary tract abnormalities. Although the
long-term consequences of febrile UTIs are difficult to ascertain, it seems that 
children with febrile UTI, normal renal function and normal kidneys at start
present a very low risk of developing decreased renal function or hypertension
during follow-up. However, high body temperature and high procalcitonin levels
during the acute phase of disease, which are indicative of severe inflammation,
and the finding of renal scarring on imaging with DMSA scintigraphy 6 months
after febrile UTI, together with the detection of congenital kidney and urinary
tract abnormalities, indicate "kidney at risk" in UTI.

PURPOSE: To describe our technique and experience with retroperitoneoscopic upper
pole nephroureterectomy in duplex kidney, focusing on the role of dilated upper
ureter.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2004 to August 2011, retroperitoneoscopic
upper pole nephroureterectomy was performed in 31 patients with a duplex kidney
by a single, experienced laparoscopic surgeon. We developed our own surgical
technique to suit this technically challenging procedure. Follow-up studies were 
performed using renal ultrasonography, intravenous urography (IVU) and/or
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in all patients at 3 months
postoperatively and annually thereafter.
RESULTS: All procedures were completed laparoscopically without conversion to
open surgery and blood transfusion. The mean operative time was 106 (90-157) min.
The estimated blood loss was < 50 mL in all cases. The mean postoperative
hospital stay was 4.2 (3-7) days. Perioperative complications were limited to 1
case of peritoneal tear during a procedure and 1 case of transient postoperative 
fever. No major intraoperative and postoperative complication occurred. With the 
mean follow-up period of 41 months (range 3 to 80), no case was observed to have 
functional loss of the remaining lower moiety on postoperative IVU or DMSA renal 
scan.
CONCLUSION: Retroperitoneoscopic upper pole nephroureterectomy using our
technique is safe and effective.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated relation of preoperative renal scar to incidence of
postoperative metabolic acidosis following ileocystoplasty in patients with
neurogenic bladder.
PATIENTS: Thirty patients with neurogenic bladder, who underwent ileocystoplasty,
were enrolled in the present study. Median age at ileocystoplasty was 13.9 years 
and median follow-up period after ileocystoplasty was 8.2 years. Metabolic
acidosis was defined based on the outlined criteria: base excess (BE) is less
than 0 mmol l(-1). Preoperative examination revealed that no apparent renal
insufficiency was identified in blood analysis, although preoperative
(99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy indicated abnormalities such as renal scar in 14
patients (47%). Incidence of postoperative metabolic acidosis was compared
between patients with and without preoperative renal scar, which may reflect some
extent of renal tubular damage.
RESULTS: Postoperative metabolic acidosis was identified in 13 patients (43%).
Incidence of postoperative metabolic acidosis was significantly higher in
patients with renal scar (11/14, 79%) compared with patients without renal scar
(2/16, 13%; P<0.01). Particularly, all eight patients who had bilateral renal
scars showed metabolic acidosis postoperatively. Compared with patients without
preoperative renal scar, pH (P<0.05) and BE (P<0.01) were significantly lower
postoperatively in patients with preoperative renal scar. However, there was no
significant difference in PCO2. Hyperchloremia was observed in each patient with 
or without preoperative renal scar.
CONCLUSION: Incidence of postoperative metabolic acidosis was significantly
implicated in preoperative renal scar. If renal abnormalities are preoperatively 
identified in imaging tests, we need to care patients carefully regarding
metabolic acidosis and subsequent comorbidities following ileocystoplasty.

Long-term outcome of intravesical oxybutynin in children with detrusor-sphincter 
dyssynergia: with special reference to age-dependent parameters.

AIMS: Intravesical instillation of oxybutynin is an accepted and effective
treatment in children with neuropathic bladder-sphincter dysfunction, when oral
oxybutynin results in inadequate suppression of detrusor overactivity or
intolerable side effects. However, as yet no data are available on long-term use 
and outcome.
METHODS: A patient cohort with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia that started oral
oxybutynin between 1995 and 1997 was re-evaluated 15 ± 1 years after the switch
from oral to intravesical (n = 10), with urodynamic investigations, renal
ultrasounds, DMSA-scintigraphy, (51)Cr-EDTA-clearance, and validated
questionnaires on incontinence and quality of life.
RESULTS: At follow-up, cystometric bladder capacity (CBC) had increased to the
25-50% percentiles for age, from the 5% percentile; mean end-filling pressure,
24.5 ± 14.4 cm H2O, had returned to the safe zone; bladder compliance expressed
as a fraction of normal compliance for age (Wahl units) showed a statistically
significant increase. At follow-up, the prevalence of renal scars was 30% (95%
CI: 6-65%). Kidney lengths correlated with scarring at DMSA-scintigraphy,
(51)Cr-EDTA-clearance did not. In 2 years of oral oxybutynin we documented 10
pyelonephritic episodes, in 15 years of intravesical oxybutynin only three.
Urinary continence was reported as satisfying, its impact on quality of life as
acceptable.
CONCLUSION: Percentile charts for cystometric bladder capacity and individual
kidney lengths, age-dependent parameters, were invaluable in estimating long-term
outcome, and the same goes for bladder compliance in Wahl units. We can conclude 
that intravesical oxybutynin provided more than adequate suppression of detrusor 
activity, without side effects, over a period of 15 years.

relaxation measurements and magnetic hyperthermia.

Nickel ferrite nanoparticles were synthesized via a facile solvothermal approach.
Oleylamine (OAm) was used in all synthetic procedures as a stabilizing agent and 
solvent. By varying the polarity of the solvents, hydrophobic NiFe2O4
nanoparticles coated with OAm of relatively similar sizes (9-11.7 nm) and in a
range of magnetization values (32.0-53.5 emu g(-1)) were obtained. The
as-prepared hydrophobic nanoparticles were characterized by XRD, TEM, SEM, TGA
and VSM and converted to hydrophilic by two different approaches. The addition of
a positively charged ligand (cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, CTAB) and the
ligand exchange procedure (2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA) have been
successfully applied. The aqueous suspensions of NiFe2O4@CTAB and NiFe2O4@DMSA
showed good colloidal stability after a long period of time. The different
surface modification affected both the NMR relaxometric measurements and the
hyperthermia effects. In both techniques CTAB modification demonstrated higher r2
relaxivity (278.9 s(-1) mM(-1) in an NMR spectrometer at 11.7 T) and SAR values
(423.4 W g(-1) at an applied AC field with a particle concentration of 0.5 mg
mL(-1)). The results indicate that a coating with a larger molecule as CTAB under
the same size, shape and magnetization of NiFe2O4 NPs gave rise to NMR
relaxometric properties and heating efficacy.

PURPOSE: Here we report the results of a review of a prospectively maintained
database of the use polyacrylate polyalcohol copolymer (PPC) injection to correct
grades IV and V VUR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All children with grades IV and V primary VUR that
presented with febrile urinary tract infection while on prophylaxis, in a 3-year 
period, were treated with a sub-ureteral injection of PPC. Institutional ethical 
approval was obtained. Exclusion criteria were incomplete bladder emptying
documented on videourodynamic study, ureteral duplication, paraureteral
diverticula, and poor ureteral emptying observed during fluoroscopy and previous 
open surgical or endoscopic treatment. Pre- and post-operative evaluation
included urinalysis, renal and bladder ultrasonography, DMSA scan, and
videourodynamic studies.
RESULTS: Thirty-three children [36 renal units (RU)] were included with a median 
age of 57 months (range 7-108). There were 18 boys and 15 girls. Thirty RU had
grade IV and 6 grade V VUR. Median follow-up time was 32 months (range 7-58).
Reflux was cured in 32/36 RU with the first injection, but another two patients
were reimplanted because of dilatation. Complications included early urinary
tract infection in seven children, transient lower urinary tract symptoms in five
children. Progressive ureteral dilatation was noted in four children and was
treated with insertion of a double J stent. Two of these children eventually
required an ureteroneocystostomy.
CONCLUSION: The use of PPC to treat grades IV and V vesicoureteral reflux in
young children has an overall success rate of 83.3%. Persistent ureteral
dilatation was present in 11% associated with high injection volume. Future
studies will attempt to maintain a high success rate reducing the volume of
injection and the incidence of dilatation.

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid
(DMPS) are chelating agents which have been used clinically to treat patients
suffering from Pb(2+) or Hg(2+) exposure. Cd(2+) is a related environmental
pollutant that is of increasing public health concern due to a demonstrated
dose-response between urinary Cd level and an increased risk of diabetes.
However, therapeutically effective chelating agents which enhance the excretion
of Cd(2+) from humans have yet to be identified. Here we present a structural
characterization of complexes of DMSA and DMPS with Cd(2+) at physiological pH
using a combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy, size exclusion
chromatography and density functional theory. The results indicate a complex
chemistry in which multi-metallic forms are important, but are consistent with
both DMPS and DMSA acting as true chelators, using two thiolates for DMPS and one
thiolate and one carboxylate for DMSA.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of an acute (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scan in predicting dilating vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) among young
children with a febrile urinary tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: The medical records of children (≤ 2 years of age), presenting with
febrile UTI between January 2000 and December 2011, were retrospectively
reviewed.
RESULTS: A total of 523 children were included in this study, of whom 397
children (75.9%) had abnormal DMSA results and 178 children (34.0%) were
identified as VUR on micturating cystourethrography (MCU). Among all the
patients, the number of children with dilating VUR was 151 (28.9%). The rate of
abnormal results on DMSA for the dilating VUR group was significantly higher than
the rates for the non-VUR and low-grade VUR groups (P < .01). In the <6 months
age group and ≥ 6 months age group, the sensitivities of DMSA in predicting
dilating VUR were 96.15% and 100.0%, respectively, the negative predictive values
were 97.26% and 100.0%, respectively, and the negative likelihood ratios were
0.0911 and 0.0000, respectively.
CONCLUSION: For children ≤ 2 years of age with a febrile UTI, an acute DMSA scan 
is valuable in the exclusion of dilating VUR. The likelihood of the presence of
dilating VUR on MCU is rather low when the result of DMSA is negative. DMSA
should be conducted to assess the need for an MCU.

of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey, cakbal@gmail.com.

PURPOSE: The aims were (1) to assess the pediatric lower urinary tract symptom
score (SS) prior to treatment as a means of determining severity of overactive
bladder (OAB) and (2) to investigate relationships between SS results and those
of standard diagnostic modalities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Symptom scores were recorded pre- and 6 months SS for 294 
children with OAB unrelated to neurological disorder.
Uroflowmetry-electromyography data, total bladder capacity, and a 2-day bladder
diary were also recorded, and upper urinary tract deterioration was investigated 
as indicated. Overactive bladder was treated with standard approaches. No
response to treatment was defined as 0-49% reduction in OAB-related symptoms
based on SS results. Non-responders underwent additional evaluations as
indicated.
RESULTS: Two hundred forty-one patients (97%; mean age 9.8 ± 2.8 years; mean
follow-up 11 months; range 6-18 months) completed the study. One hundred thirteen
(47%) required ultrasonography (USG), and those with abnormal USG had a
significantly higher pre- and 6 months SS (p = 0.016). All non-responders (n =
38; 16%) underwent urodynamics evaluation, 34 underwent spinal magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), 34 underwent voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), and 34 underwent
dimercaptosuccinic acid scanning (DMSA). Non-responders with terminal detrusor
hyperactivity had significantly lower SS after therapy (p = 0.09). Non-responders
with abnormal MRI had higher pre- and 6 months SS than those with normal MRI.
Thirteen (38%) of the non-responders who required VCUG had vesicoureteral reflux 
(VUR), and this subgroup had higher pre-treatment SS (p = 0.030). Seven (21%) of 
the non-responders who required DMSA had scarring, and all 7 had VUR. The
subgroup with scarring had higher pre-treatment SS (p = 0.030).
CONCLUSION: Pediatric OAB patients with high 6 months SS have a higher incidence 
of additional upper urinary tract pathology. Those with low pre-treatment SS
require fewer laboratory tests and other assessments. The SS tool can reduce the 
number of urodynamics evaluations, and other tests required to diagnose renal
damage in children with OAB.

Bacopa monniera is a rejuvenating herb for brain cells enhancing learning and
cognitive ability. In the present investigation, the ameliorative effects of
Bacopa monniera were examined against lead-induced oxidative stress in different 
regions of rat brain. Male rats were divided into five groups: control (1000 ppm 
sodium acetate) and exposed (1000 ppm lead acetate) for 4 weeks; DMSA
(Meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid)-treated (90 mg/kg body weight/day); Bacopa
monniera-treated (BM) (10 mg/kg body weight/day) and a combination of BM + DMSA
for seven consecutive days after 4 weeks of lead exposure. After treatment, the
whole brain was isolated by sacrificing rats and four regions were separated
namely cerebellum, hippocampus, frontal cortex and brain stem. Results indicated 
a significant (p < 0.05) increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid
peroxidation products (LPP) and total protein carbonyl content (TPCC) in
association with tissue metal content in all the four regions of brain for
exposed group compared with their respective controls. However, the lead-induced 
ROS, LPP, TPCC and tissue metal content were lowered on treatment with Bacopa
monniera, almost reaching the control group values in all the above brain regions
compared to DMSA and a combination therapy. Results suggest that Bacopa monniera 
can mitigate the lead induced-oxidative stress tissue specifically by
pharmacologic interventions which encompass both chelation as well as antioxidant
functions.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the differences in uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose
(2-DG)-conjugated nanoparticles between breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells with
high metabolism and breast fibroblasts with normal metabolism, and investigate
the feasibility of using the coated nanoparticles as a MRI-targeted contrast
agent for highly metabolic carcinoma cells.
METHODS: The γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG was prepared. The glucose metabolism level of both
cell lines was determined. The targeting efficacy of γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG and
γ-Fe2O3@DMSA NPs to breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells and breast fibroblasts at
10 min, 30 min, 1 h and 2 h was measured with Prussian blue staining and UV
colorimetric assay. MRI was performed to visualize the changes of T2WI signal
intensity.
RESULTS: Prussian blue staining showed more intracellular blue granules in the
MDA-MB-231 cells of γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG NPs group than that in the γ-Fe2O3@DMSA NPs
group, and the γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG uptake was greatly competed by free D-glucose. As 
revealed by UV colorimetric assay, MDA-MB-231 cells also showed that the cellular
iron amount of γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG group was significantly higher than that of the
γ-Fe2O3@DMSA group and γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG + D-glucose group, statistically with a
significant difference between them. MRI showed that the signal intensity of
γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG group was decrease significantly, the T2 signal intensity was
decreased by 10.5%, 37.5%, 72.9%, 92.0% for 10 min, 30 min, 1 h and 2 h,
respectively. In contrast, the signal intensity did not show obvious decrease in 
the γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG group, the T2 signal intensity was decreased by 8.5%, 11.4%, 
32.0%, 76.7% for 10 min, 30 min, 1 h and 2 h, respectively. However,
HUM-CELL-0056 cells did not produce apparent difference for positive staining in 
the γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG group, γ-Fe2O3@DMSA group and γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG+D-glucose
group, and the signal intensity also did not produce apparent difference.
CONCLUSIONS: γ-Fe2O3@DMSA-DG has good targeting ability to highly metabolic
breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231) cells. It is feasible to serve as a specific
MRI-targeted contrast agent for highly metabolic carcinoma cells, and deserves
further studies in vivo.

Vesicoureteric reflux in children.

Kari JA(1), El-Desoky SM, Basnawi F, Bahrawi O.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia.

AIM: This study aimed to identify the differences between primary and secondary
vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and the effect of associated bladder abnormalities on
kidney function.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children
with VUR who were followed up at King Abdulaziz University Hospital from January 
2005 to December 2010. The review included results of radiological investigations
and kidney function tests. We used Chi-square test for statistical analysis and
paired t-test to compare group means for initial and last creatinine levels.
RESULTS: Ninety-nine children were included in this study. Twenty (20.2%) had
primary VUR, 11 had high-grade VUR, while 9 had low-grade reflux. All children
with low-grade VUR had normal dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). Renal scars were
present in 72% of the children with high-grade VUR. The mean creatinine levels
(initial and last) for both groups were normal. Seventy-nine (79.8%) children had
secondary VUR, which was due to posterior urethral valves (PUV) (46.8%),
neurogenic bladder caused by meningomyelocele (25.3%), non-neurogenic neurogenic 
bladder (NNB) (21.5%), or neurogenic bladder associated with prune belly syndrome
(6.3%). Children with NNB, meningomyelocele and PUV had high creatinine at
presentation with no considerable worsening of their kidney functions during the 
last visit. Renal scars were present in 49.4% of the children with secondary VUR.
CONCLUSION: Children with primary VUR and normal bladder had good-functioning
kidneys, while those with secondary VUR associated with abnormal bladder caused
by NNB, spina bifida or PUV had abnormal kidney functions. DMSA scans were useful
in predicting higher grades of VUR in children with primary reflux.

Lately, the isolation of DNA using magnetic nanoparticles has received increased 
attention owing to their facile manipulation and low costs. Although methods
involving their magnetic separation have been extensively studied, there is
currently a need for an efficient technique to isolate DNA for highly sensitive
diagnostic applications. We describe herein a method to isolate and purify DNA
using biofunctionalized superparamagnetic nanoparticles synthesized by a modified
polyol method to obtain the desired monodispersity, followed by surface
modification with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) containing carboxyl
groups for DNA absorption. The DMSA-coated magnetic nanoparticles (DMSA-MNPs)
were used for the isolation of DNA, with a maximum yield of 86.16%. In
particular, we found that the isolation of DNA using small quantities of
DMSA-MNPs was much more efficient than that using commercial microbeads
(NucliSENS-easyMAG, BioMérieux). Moreover, the DMSA-MNPs were successfully
employed in the isolation of genomic DNA from human blood. In addition, the
resulting DNA-nanoparticle complex was directly subjected to PCR amplification
without prior elution, which could eventually lead to simple, rapid, sensitive
and integrated diagnostic systems.

A biphasic solvothermal reaction method has been used for the synthesis of TiO2
nanoparticles (NPs). In this method, hydrolysis and nucleation occur at the
interface of organic phase (titanium (IV) n-propoxide and stearic acid dissolved 
in toluene) and water phase (tert-butylamine dissolved in water) resulting in the
nucleation of the stearic acid-capped TiO2 NPs. These NPs are hydrophilic due to 
hydrophobic stearic acid ligands and could be dispersed in toluene, but not in
water. These stearic acid-capped TiO2 NPs were surface-modified with
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in order to make them water soluble. The
resultant TiO2 NPs were easily redispersed in water without any noticeable
aggregation. The Rietveld profile fitting of X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of
the TiO2 NPs revealed highly crystalline anatase structure. The average
crystallite size of TiO2 NPs was calculated to be 6.89 nm, which agrees with TEM 
results. These results have important implications for the use of TiO2 in
biomedical, environmental, and industrial applications.

The clinical significance of pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc(V)-DMSA) scintigraphy in diagnosing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has
not yet been fully elucidated. The aim of this prospective paper was to study the
above. This study included 54 patients, 22 females and 32 males (mean age:
36.68±11.49; range: 18-63 years) with IBD who came to our clinics for follow-up
and were examined clinically by colonoscopy and 99mTc(V)-DMSA scintigraphy. On
the follow-up studies, five patients (9.25%) relapsed, and 49 (90.74%) remained
at a steady condition. There was a good correlation between the scintigraphic
results and the clinical and colonoscopy data of the patients (P<0.05). In
conclusion, our results indicated that 99mTc(V)DMSA scintigraphy can be
complementary to colonoscopy for the diagnostic evaluation of IBD.

Is microalbuminuria a risk factor for hypertension in children with solitary
kidney?

Shirzai A(1), Yildiz N, Biyikli N, Ustunsoy S, Benzer M, Alpay H.

Istanbul, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: The correlations between ambulatory blood pressure measurements
(ABPM) and serum cystatin C (Cys C), serum creatinine (Cr), microalbumin (MA),
and β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) levels in 24 h (24-h) urine were analyzed in
children with solitary kidney (SK) and compared to healthy children.
METHODS: Fifty children with normal functioning SK and 25 controls were studied. 
The ABPM, serum Cys C, serum Cr, MA, and β2-MG levels in 24-h urine were measured
in all children. Clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory results, urinary
ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, and Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy results were recorded in the SK group. Four patients with Wilms'
tumor and two with renal scarring were excluded from the study.
RESULTS: The mean ages of the SK group and controls were 9.6 ± 3.6 and 9.3 ± 3.3 
years, respectively. The serum Cys C and Cr levels, 24-h urinary β2-MG and MA
levels were similar in both groups (p > 0.05). However, 24-h urinary MA excretion
was higher in patients living with SK more than 5 years (p = 0.01). Standard
deviation scores of ABPM parameters showed no significant correlation with serum 
Cr, serum Cys C, MA, and β2-MG in 24-h urine of both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with SK have increased 24-h urinary MA excretion in the
long term, and need prolonged follow-up to detect early deterioration of renal
function and to prevent end-organ damage later in life.

The role of chelation in the treatment of arsenic and mercury poisoning.

Chelation for heavy metal intoxication began more than 70 years ago with the
development of British anti-lewisite (BAL; dimercaprol) in wartime Britain as a
potential antidote the arsenical warfare agent lewisite
(dichloro[2-chlorovinyl]arsine). DMPS (unithiol) and DMSA (succimer), dithiol
water-soluble analogs of BAL, were developed in the Soviet Union and China in the
late 1950s. These three agents have remained the mainstay of chelation treatment 
of arsenic and mercury intoxication for more than half a century. Animal
experiments and in some instances human data indicate that the dithiol chelators 
enhance arsenic and mercury excretion. Controlled animal experiments support a
therapeutic role for these chelators in the prompt treatment of acute poisoning
by arsenic and inorganic mercury salts. Treatment should be initiated as rapidly 
as possible (within minutes to a few hours), as efficacy declines or disappears
as the time interval between metal exposure and onset of chelation increases.
DMPS and DMSA, which have a higher therapeutic index than BAL and do not
redistribute arsenic or mercury to the brain, offer advantages in clinical
practice. Although chelation following chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic and 
inorganic mercury may accelerate metal excretion and diminish metal burden in
some organs, potential therapeutic efficacy in terms of decreased morbidity and
mortality is largely unestablished in cases of chronic metal intoxication.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan to magnetic resonance urography (MRU)
in the identification of renal parenchyma defects (RPD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five children with history of acute pyelonephritis 
and vesicoureteral reflux underwent DMSA scan and MRU to determine the presence
of RPD. DMSA scans and MRUs were each evaluated by two radiologists and agreement
achieved by consensus. Discordant DMSA-MRU findings were re-evaluated in a
side-by-side comparison and an ultimate consensus reached.
RESULTS: The ultimate consensus diagnosis was 18 kidneys with RPDs in 15
patients, of which five were classified as mild RPDs, six as moderate RPDs, and
seven as severe RPDs. Although DMSA scan and MRU were similar in their ability to
diagnose RPDs, MRU was considered to represent the true diagnosis in 11 of the 12
discordant cases in consensus review by four pediatric radiologists. MRU showed a
much higher inter-observer agreement with a weighted kappa of 0.96 for both
kidneys compared to 0.71 for the right kidney and 0.86 for the left kidney by
DMSA scan.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that MRU is superior to DMSA scan in the
identification of renal parenchyma defects.

Recommendations for provoked challenge urine testing.

Ruha AM(1).

for Toxicology and Pharmacology Education and Research, University of Arizona
College of Medicine, Phoenix, AZ, USA, michelle.ruha@bannerhealth.com.

"Urine mobilization test," "challenge test," and "provoked urine test" are all
terms used to describe the administration of a chelating agent to a person prior 
to collection of their urine to test for metals. There is no standard, validated 
challenge test. Despite recommendations by professional and government
organizations against the use of provoked urine testing, the tests are still
commonly used and recommended by some practitioners. Challenge testing utilizes a
variety of chelating agents, including dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),
dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).
The agents are given by a variety of routes of administration, doses used are
inconsistent, and urine collection procedures vary. Additional problems with
challenge tests include comparison of results to inappropriate reference ranges
and creatinine correction of urine obtained within hours of chelator
administration. Human volunteer studies demonstrate that mercury is detected in
the urine of most people even in the absence of known exposure or chelator
administration, and that urinary mercury excretion rises after administration of 
a chelator, regardless of exposure history and in an unpredictable fashion.
Studies also demonstrate that challenge testing fails to reveal a "body burden"
of mercury due to remote exposure. Chelating agents have been associated with
adverse reactions. Current evidence does not support the use of DMPS, DMSA, or
other chelation challenge tests for the diagnosis of metal toxicity. Since there 
are no established reference ranges for provoked urine samples in healthy
subjects, no reliable evidence to support a diagnostic value for the tests, and
potential harm, these tests should not be utilized.

The role of chelation in the treatment of other metal poisonings.

Smith SW(1).

University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA, Silas.Smith@nyumc.org.

These proceedings will review the role of chelation in five metals-aluminum,
cadmium, chromium, cobalt, and uranium-in order to illustrate various chelation
concepts. The process of "chelation" can often be oversimplified, leading to
incorrect assumptions and risking patient harm. For chelation to be effective,
two critical assumptions must be fulfilled: the presumed "metal toxicity" must
correlate with a given body or a particular compartment burden, and reducing this
compartmental or the body burden (through chelation) attenuates toxicity.
Fulfilling these assumptions requires an established dose-response relationship, 
a validated, reproducible means of toxicity assessment (clinical, biochemical, or
radiographical), and an appropriate assessment mechanisms of body or compartment 
burden. While a metal might "technically" be capable of chelation (and readily
demonstrable in urine or feces), this is an insufficient endpoint. Clinical
relevance must be affirmed. Deferoxamine is an accepted chelator for
appropriately documented aluminum toxicity. There is a very minimal treatment
window in order to address chelation in cadmium toxicity. In acute toxicity,
while no definitive chelation benefit is described, succimer (DMSA),
diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA), and potentially ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) have been considered. In chronic toxicity, chelation is unsupported. 
There is little evidence to suggest that currently available chromium chelators
are efficacious. Similarly, scant human evidence exists with which to provide
recommendation for cobalt chelation. DTPA has been recommended for cobalt
radionuclide chelation, although DMSA, EDTA, and N-acetylcysteine have also been 
suggested. DTPA is unsupported for uranium chelation. Sodium bicarbonate is
currently recommended, although animal evidence is conflicting.

PURPOSE: The radiolanthanide (161)Tb (T 1/2 = 6.90 days, Eβ(-) av = 154 keV) was 
recently proposed as a potential alternative to (177)Lu (T 1/2 = 6.71 days, Eβ(-)
av = 134 keV) due to similar physical decay characteristics but additional
conversion and Auger electrons that may enhance the therapeutic efficacy. The
goal of this study was to compare (161)Tb and (177)Lu in vitro and in vivo using 
a tumour-targeted DOTA-folate conjugate (cm09).
METHODS: (161)Tb-cm09 and (177)Lu-cm09 were tested in vitro on folate receptor
(FR)-positive KB and IGROV-1 cancer cells using a
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability
assay. In vivo (161)Tb-cm09 and (177)Lu-cm09 (10 MBq, 0.5 nmol) were investigated
in two different tumour mouse models with regard to the biodistribution, the
possibility for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and
the antitumour efficacy. Potentially undesired side effects were monitored over 6
months by determination of plasma parameters and examination of kidney function
with quantitative SPECT using (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).
RESULTS: To obtain half-maximal inhibition of tumour cell viability a 4.5-fold
(KB) and 1.7-fold (IGROV-1) lower radioactivity concentration was required for
(161)Tb-cm09 (IC50 ~0.014 MBq/ml and ~2.53 MBq/ml) compared to (177)Lu-cm09 (IC50
~0.063 MBq/ml and ~4.52 MBq/ml). SPECT imaging visualized tumours of mice with
both radioconjugates. However, in therapy studies (161)Tb-cm09 reduced tumour
growth more efficiently than (177)Lu-cm09. These findings were in line with the
higher absorbed tumour dose for (161)Tb-cm09 (3.3 Gy/MBq) compared to
(177)Lu-cm09 (2.4 Gy/MBq). None of the monitored parameters indicated signs of
impaired kidney function over the whole time period of investigation after
injection of the radiofolates.
CONCLUSION: Compared to (177)Lu-cm09 we demonstrated equal imaging features for
(161)Tb-cm09 but an increased therapeutic efficacy for (161)Tb-cm09 in both
tumour cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Further preclinical studies using other
tumour-targeting radioconjugates are clearly necessary to draw final conclusions 
about the future clinical perspectives of (161)Tb.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether early initiation of clean intermittent
catheterization is associated with increased renal preservation in children with 
spinal dysraphism based on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 100 patients from a pediatric
spinal defects clinic from June 2007 to October 2011 who were followed with
routine studies including DMSA scans, voiding cystourethrograms, renal/bladder
ultrasounds, and urodynamics. DMSA scans were reviewed for evidence of renal
cortical loss as defined by presence of scarring or difference in differential
function greater than 15%. Multivariate analysis was performed for risk factors
for upper tract damage.
RESULTS: Renal cortical loss on DMSA scan was found in 43/100 (43%) of patients. 
CIC was started at birth in 17/100 (17%) of patients with the rest starting at a 
median age of 5 years (IQR 3-9). Upon multivariate regression analysis, age at
DMSA scan (OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.08-1.36), history of VUR (OR 8.64; 95% CI
2.52-29.57), history of hydronephrosis (OR 3.44; 95% CI 1.12-10.5), and CIC from 
birth (OR 9.26; 95% CI 1.99-43.18) were statistically significant predictors of
kidney damage.
CONCLUSION: Early initiation of CIC may not reduce the incidence of DMSA
abnormalities in pediatric patients with spinal dysraphism.

The hydrophobic region of the DmsA twin-arginine leader peptide determines
specificity with chaperone DmsD.

The system specific chaperone DmsD plays a role in the maturation of the
catalytic subunit of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase, DmsA. Pre-DmsA contains
a 45-amino acid twin-arginine leader peptide that is important for targeting and 
translocation of folded and cofactor-loaded DmsA by the twin-arginine
translocase. DmsD has previously been shown to interact with the complete
twin-arginine leader peptide of DmsA. In this study, isothermal titration
calorimetry was used to investigate the thermodynamics of binding between
synthetic peptides composed of different portions of the DmsA leader peptide and 
DmsD. Only those peptides that included the complete and contiguous hydrophobic
region of the DmsA leader sequence were able to bind DmsD with a 1:1
stoichiometry. Each of the peptides that were able to bind DmsD also showed some 
α-helical structure as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Differential
scanning calorimetry revealed that DmsD gained very little thermal stability upon
binding any of the DmsA leader peptides tested. Together, these results suggest
that a portion of the hydrophobic region of the DmsA leader peptide determines
the specificity of binding and may produce helical properties upon binding to
DmsD. Overall, this study demonstrates that the recognition of the DmsA
twin-arginine leader sequence by the DmsD chaperone shows unexpected rules and
confirms further that the biochemistry of the interaction of the chaperone with
their leaders demonstrates differences in their molecular interactions.

Endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteric reflux with dextranomer/hyaluronic acid
copolymer (Deflux): Single-surgeon experience with 48 ureters.

Chandrasekharam VV(1).

Children's Hospitals, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.

PURPOSE: VUR is a common urologic problem in children. Cystoscopic injection of
bulking agents (most commonly Deflux) has gained popularity as the first line
treatment in the west. However, primarily due to cost factors, it has not gained 
much popularity in our country. We present our initial experience with
cystoscopic Deflux injection for VUR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed our 3-yr experience with the use of Dx/HA
(Deflux) for correction of VUR in children and adolescents. All children were
evaluated with Ultrasound, MCUG and DMSA renal cortical scan. The indications for
surgical correction of VUR included breakthrough infections while on antibiotic
prophylaxis, persistent high-grade VUR beyond 3 yrs of age, and presence of
significant renal damage on DMSA at diagnosis (in those children presenting with 
UTI). All children underwent cystoscopic Deflux injection using the standard
technique of subureteral injection (0.4-1 ml per ureter). All children received
antibiotic prophylaxis for 3-6 months after the injection. USG was done at 1
month and MCUG at 3-6 months after the injection.
RESULTS: 33 patients (48 ureters) underwent cystoscopic Deflux injection for
correction of VUR. Mean age was 4.5 yrs (1-17 yrs); there were 12 boys and 21
girls. Thirteen children had antenatally diagnosed HDN, while 20 children
presented with febrile UTI. All children had primary VUR except one child with
persistent VUR 4 yrs after PUV fulguration. The VUR was grade 1-2 in 8, grade 3-4
in 37, and grade 5 in 3 ureters. Every child had at least one ureter with
dilating reflux (grades 3,4 or 5). When present, low grade VUR (grade 1or 2) was 
always on the contralateral side. Only one child received a 2(nd) injection after
6 months. Follow-up MCUG was done in 28 children (41 ureters). Complete reflux
resolution was achieved in 27 ureters (65%), and the reflux was downgraded in 2
(5%). There were no complications of Deflux injection.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic correction of VUR in children is a safe and effective
minimally invasive treatment for VUR. It stops or downgrades VUR in 70% of
ureters. At present, we recommend it as a first-line treatment for grades 1-4 VUR
requiring surgical management. Cost is the major factor limiting its use in our
country.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the development of recurrent urinary tract infections
(UTIs) in boys who have undergone hypospadias repair.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all boys who
had recurrent UTIs after primary or redo tubularized incised plate (TIP) or
transverse island flap (TVIF) repairs, between 1998 and 2009. Data on age,
operating details, postoperative complications and imaging studies were
collected. We attempted to identify risk factors for recurrent UTIs after
hypospadias repair.
RESULTS: During the study period, 43/2249 boys (1.91%) were diagnosed with
recurrent UTIs after hypospadias repair. The boys' mean (range) age at repair was
14 (6-24) months and the median (range) follow-up was 6.5 (1.5-11) years. Primary
TIP and TVIF were performed in 47% (20/43) and 35% (15/43) of the boys,
respectively. Redo surgeries were performed in 18% of the boys (8/43). The
initial meatal location was proximal in all TVIF and redo repairs, and in one of 
the TIP repairs. Postoperative voiding cysto-urethrography, ultrasonography and
dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scans were performed in 58% (25/43), 90% (39/43) 
and 19% (8/43) of the boys, respectively. Abnormalities were noted. Of those boys
who underwent a TVIF repair, urethral diverticula were seen in 47% (7/15) and
urethral fistulae were also seen in 47% (7/15). Conversely, in those who had a
TIP repair, an elevated PVR and vesico-ureteric reflux were more common; they
were found in 40% (8/20) and 50% (10/20) of patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The pathophysiology of recurrent UTI is multifactorial, but
postoperative complications seem to vary with type of procedure. Recurrent UTIs
after hypospadias surgery should prompt a specific assessment for potentially
functionally relevant and correctable anatomical abnormalities.

AIM: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic upper pole
heminephroureterectomy (HNU) in pediatric patients with duplex kidneys in
comparison with open surgery.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2007 to 2011, 27 patients underwent HNU. A
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) isotope scan revealed hypofunctioning of
ipsilateral moieties in all cases. The patients were divided randomly into
laparoscopic HNU (LHNU) and open surgery HNU (OHNU) groups. LHNU was performed by
the transperitoneal approach in 10 girls and 5 boys with a mean age of 33 months 
(range, 9-108 months). All procedures were performed using three or four ports.
Open surgery was performed in 10 girls and 2 boys with a mean age of 29 months
(range, 7-174 months) by the retroperitoneal approach in all cases. Follow-up
included ultrasound and DMSA.
RESULTS: Mean operative time in the LHNU and OHNU groups was 148 minutes (range, 
100-220 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI] 129-167 minutes) and 124 minutes
(range, 100-150 minutes; 95% CI 115-133 minutes), respectively. In the LHNU and
OHNU groups, mean analgesic requirement was 2.8 days (range, 2-4 days; 95% CI
2.4-3.2 days) and 3.7 days (range, 3-5 days; 95% CI 3.3-4.1 days), and mean
hospital stay was 4.0 days (range, 2-8 days; 95% CI 3.2-4.8 days) and 5.1 days
(range, 3-8 days; 95% CI 4.3-5.9 days), respectively. No intraoperative or major 
postoperative complications occurred. No conversion to open surgery was necessary
in the LHNU group. Statistical analysis showed no statistical significant
difference (P>.05) in the operating time between groups, whereas differences in
the mean hospital stay (P=.048) and analgesic requirements (P=.005) were
significant. The function of the remnant pole was preserved in all patients.
Follow-up ultrasound showed asymptomatic cystic structures in 1 patient.
CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic upper pole HNU is a safe and feasible procedure,
even in infants. It is associated with minimal morbidity, and the operative time 
is acceptable and not significantly longer in comparison with the open approach. 
LHNU reduces analgesic requirements and hospital stay. In our opinion it should
be the preferred option for HNU in children.

Targeted radionuclide therapy has shown impressive results for the palliative
treatment of several types of cancer diseases. The folate receptor has been
identified as specifically associated with a variety of frequent tumor types.
Therefore, it is an attractive target for the development of new radionuclide
therapies using folate-based radioconjugates. Previously, we found that
pemetrexed (PMX) has a favorable effect in reducing undesired renal uptake of
radiofolates. Moreover, PMX also acts as a chemotherapeutic and radiosensitizing 
agent on tumors. Thus, the aim of our study was to investigate the combined
application of PMX and the therapeutic radiofolate (177)Lu-EC0800. Determination 
of the combination index (CI) revealed a synergistic inhibitory effect of
(177)Lu-EC0800 and PMX on the viability of folate receptor-positive cervical (KB)
and ovarian (IGROV-1) cancer cells in vitro (CI < 0.8). In an in vivo study,
tumor-bearing mice were treated with (177)Lu-EC0800 (20 MBq) and a subtherapeutic
(0.4 mg) or therapeutic amount (1.6 mg) of PMX. Application of (177)Lu-EC0800
with PMXther resulted in a two- to four-fold enhanced tumor growth delay and a
prolonged survival of KB and IGROV-1 tumor-bearing mice, as compared to the
combination with PMXsubther or untreated control mice. PMXsubther protected the
kidneys from undesired side effects of (177)Lu-EC0800 (20 MBq) by reducing the
absorbed radiation dose. Intact kidney function was shown by determination of
plasma parameters and quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography
using (99m)Tc-DMSA. Our results confirmed the anticipated dual role of PMX. Its
unique features resulted in an improved antitumor effect of folate-based
radionuclide therapy and prevented undesired radio-nephrotoxicity.

Presenting a foreign antigen on live attenuated Edwardsiella tarda using
twin-arginine translocation signal peptide as a multivalent vaccine.

(1)State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of
Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, PR China.

The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system is a major pathway for transmembrane
translocation of fully folded proteins. In this study, a multivalent vaccine to
present foreign antigens on live attenuated vaccine Edwardsiella tarda WED using 
screened Tat signal peptide was constructed. Because the Tat system increases the
yields of folded antigens in periplasmic space or extracellular milieu, it is
expected to contribute to the production of conformational epitope-derived
specific antibodies. E. tarda Tat signal peptides fused with the green
fluorescent protein (GFP) was constructed under the control of an in vivo
inducible dps promoter. The resulting plasmids were electroporated into WED and
the subcellular localizations of GFP were analyzed with Western blotting. Eight
signal peptides with optimized GFP translocation efficiency were further fused to
a protective antigen glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapA) from a fish 
pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila. Signal peptides of DmsA, NapA, and SufI displayed 
high efficiency for GapA translocation. The relative percent survival (RPS) of
turbot was measured with a co-infection of E. tarda and A. hydrophila, and the
strain with DmsA signal peptide showed the maximal protection. This study
demonstrated a new platform to construct multivalent vaccines using optimized Tat
signal peptide in E. tarda.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantify the relationship between
number of dental amalgam surfaces and urinary mercury levels.
METHODS: This study uses participant data from a large philanthropic chronic
disease prevention program in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Urine samples were
analysed for mercury levels (measured in μg/g-creatinine). T-tests were used to
determine if differences in urine mercury were statistically significant between 
persons with no dental amalgam surfaces and one or more dental amalgam surfaces. 
Linear regression was used to estimate the change in urinary mercury per amalgam 
surface.
RESULTS: Urinary mercury levels were statistically significantly higher in
participants with amalgam surfaces, with an average difference of 0.55
μg/g-creatinine. Per amalgam surface, we estimated an expected increase of 0.04
μg/g-creatinine. Measured urinary mercury levels were also statistically
significantly higher in participants with dental amalgam surfaces following the
oral administration of 2,3-dimercaptopropane-l-sulfonate (DMPS) and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) which are used to mobilize mercury from
the blood and tissues.
DISCUSSION: Our estimates indicate that an individual with seven or more dental
amalgam surfaces has 30% to 50% higher urinary mercury levels than an individual 
without amalgams. This is consistent with past literature that has identified
seven amalgam surfaces as an unsafe level of exposure to mercury vapor. Our
analysis suggests that continued use of silver amalgam dental fillings for
restorative dentistry is a non-negligible, unnecessary source of mercury exposure
considering the availability of composite resin alternatives.

PURPOSE: Dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy and urodynamic studies are gold
standards to evaluate renal scarring and neurogenic bladder dysfunction,
respectively. We sought to establish the value of bladder wall thickness together
with urine NGF, TGF-β1 and TIMP-2 to predict the urodynamic profile and upper
urinary tract damage in children with myelodysplasia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 80 children with myelodysplasia underwent
urodynamic investigation, bladder wall thickness measurement and
dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy with basic neurourological evaluation. Two 
study and 2 control groups were created according to presence or absence of renal
scarring on dimercapto-succinic acid scan (study and control groups 1) and
according to detrusor leak point pressure greater or less than 40 cm H2O (study
and control groups 2). Urine samples were analyzed with ELISA.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 44 girls and 36 boys with a median ±
SD age of 7.2 ± 3.6 years (range 2 to 17). Study and control groups 1 consisted
of 35 and 45 children with abnormal and normal dimercapto-succinic acid scan
findings, respectively. Study and control groups 2 included 30 and 50 children
with detrusor leak point pressure greater and less than 40 cm H2O, respectively. 
Bladder wall thickness and urinary levels of TGF-β1, NGF and TIMP-2 were
significantly increased in both study groups compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Urine markers and bladder wall thickness measurement may predict
urinary tract impairment in children with myelodysplasia. Such markers may
differentiate at risk patients with either renal scarring or high detrusor leak
point pressure, and decrease the need for urodynamics and renal scintigraphy.

Recent advances in nanotechnology have permitted the development of a wide
repertoire of inorganic magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) with extensive promise for
biomedical applications. Despite this remarkable potential, many questions still 
arise concerning the biocompatible nature of NPs when in contact with biological 
systems. Herein, we have investigated how controlled changes in the
physicochemical properties of iron oxide NPs at their surface (i.e., surface
charge and hydrodynamic size) affect, first, their interaction with cell media
components and, subsequently, cell responses to NP exposure. For that purpose, we
have prepared iron oxide NPs with three different coatings (i.e.,
dimercaptosuccinic acid - DMSA, (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane - APS and dextran)
and explored the response of two different cell types, murine L929 fibroblasts
and human Saos-2 osteoblasts, to their exposure. Interestingly, different cell
responses were found depending on the NP concentration, surface charge and cell
type. In this sense, neutral NPs, as those coated with dextran, induced
negligible cell damage, as their cellular internalization was significantly
reduced. In contrast, surface-charged NPs (i.e., those coated with DMSA and APS) 
caused significant cellular changes in viability, morphology and cell cycle under
certain culture conditions, as a result of a more active cellular
internalization. These results also revealed a particular cellular ability to
detect and remember the original physicochemical properties of the NPs, despite

Radiotherapy of abdomen with precise renal assessment with SPECT/CT imaging
(RAPRASI): design and methodology of a prospective trial to improve the
understanding of kidney radiation dose response.

Lopez-Gaitan J, Ebert MA, Robins P, Boucek J, Leong T, Willis D, Bydder S, Podias
P, Waters G, O'Mara B, Chu J, Faggian J, Williams L, Hofman MS, Spry NA.

BACKGROUND: The kidneys are a principal dose-limiting organ in radiotherapy for
upper abdominal cancers. The current understanding of kidney radiation dose
response is rudimentary. More precise dose-volume response models that allow
direct correlation of delivered radiation dose with spatio-temporal changes in
kidney function may improve radiotherapy treatment planning for upper-abdominal
tumours.
METHODS/DESIGN: The Radiotherapy of Abdomen with Precise Renal Assessment with
SPECT/CT Imaging (RAPRASI) is an observational clinical research study with
participating sites at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital (SCGH) in Perth, Australia
and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (PMCC) in Melbourne, Australia. Eligible
patients are those with upper gastrointestinal cancer, without metastatic
disease, undergoing conformal radiotherapy that will involve incidental radiation
to one or both kidneys. For each patient, total kidney function is being assessed
before commencement of radiotherapy treatment and then at 4, 12, 26, 52 and 78
weeks after the first radiotherapy fraction, using two procedures: a Glomerular
Filtration Rate (GFR) measurement using the 51Cr-ethylenediamine tetra-acetic
acid (EDTA) clearance; and a regional kidney perfusion measurement assessing
renal uptake of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), imaged with a Single Photon
Emission Computed Tomography / Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT) system. The CT
component of the SPECT/CT provides the anatomical reference of the kidney's
position. The data is intended to reveal changes in regional kidney function over
the study period after the radiotherapy. These SPECT/CT scans, co-registered with
the radiotherapy treatment plan, will provide spatial correlation between the
radiation dose and regional renal function as assessed by SPECT/CT. From this
correlation, renal response patterns will likely be identified with the purpose
of developing a predictive model.

INTRODUCTION: Children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) usually need a renal
ultrasound (RUS). There is little data on the role of follow-up RUS in VUR. We
evaluated the impact of follow-up RUS on the change in clinical management in
patients with VUR.
METHODS: We prospectively analyzed children with a previous diagnosis of VUR seen
in the outpatient clinic with a routine follow-up RUS within 4 months. Variables 
collected included: demographic data, VUR history, dysfunctional voiding symptoms
and concurrent ultrasound findings. Change in management was defined as addition 
of new medication, nurse counselling, surgery or further investigations.
RESULTS: The study included 114 consecutive patients. The mean patient age was
4.5 years old, mean age of VUR diagnosis was 1.7 years, with average follow-up of
2.8 years. A change in management with stable RUS occurred in 14 patients, in
which the change included ordering a DMSA in 9, nurse counselling for
dysfunctional voiding in 3, and booking surgery in 2 patients. Change on RUS was 
seen in 4 patients. Multivariable analysis showed that history of urinary tract
infection (UTI) since the last follow-up visit was more significant than RUS
findings.
CONCLUSIONS: The RUS findings in most patients followed for VUR remain stable or 
with minimal changes. The variable showing a significant effect on change in
management in our study was history of UTI since the last follow-up visit rather 
than RUS findings. The value of follow-up RUS for children with VUR may need to
be revisited.

ModE is the molybdate-sensing transcription regulator that controls the
expression of genes related to molybdate homeostasis in Escherichia coli. ModE is
activated by binding molybdate and acts as both an activator and a repressor. By 
genomic systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX)
screening and promoter reporter assays, we have identified a total of nine
operons, including the hitherto identified modA, moaA, dmsA, and napF operons, of
which six were activated by ModE and three were repressed. In addition, two
promoters were newly identified and direct transcription of novel genes, referred
to as morA and morB, located on antisense strands of yghW and torY, respectively.
The morA gene encodes a short peptide, MorA, with an unusual initiation codon.
Surprisingly, overexpression of the morA 5' untranslated region exhibited an
inhibitory influence on colony formation of E. coli K-12.

Long term biotransformation and toxicity of dimercaptosuccinic acid-coated
magnetic nanoparticles support their use in biomedical applications.

Although iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) have been proposed for numerous 
biomedical applications, little is known about their biotransformation and
long-term toxicity in the body. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)-coated magnetic
nanoparticles have been proven efficient for in vivo drug delivery, but these
results must nonetheless be sustained by comprehensive studies of long-term
distribution, degradation and toxicity. We studied DMSA-coated magnetic
nanoparticle effects in vitro on NCTC 1469 non-parenchymal hepatocytes, and
analyzed their biodistribution and biotransformation in vivo in C57BL/6 mice. Our
results indicate that DMSA-coated magnetic nanoparticles have little effect on
cell viability, oxidative stress, cell cycle or apoptosis on NCTC 1469 cells in
vitro. In vivo distribution and transformation were studied by alternating
current magnetic susceptibility measurements, a technique that permits
distinction of MNP from other iron species. Our results show that DMSA-coated MNP
accumulate in spleen, liver and lung tissues for extended periods of time, in
which nanoparticles undergo a process of conversion from superparamagnetic iron
oxide nanoparticles to other non-superparamagnetic iron forms, with no
significant signs of toxicity. This work provides the first evidence of
DMSA-coated magnetite nanoparticle biotransformation in vivo.

Leishmanicidal activity of amphotericin B encapsulated in PLGA-DMSA nanoparticles
to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis in C57BL/6 mice.

The major goal of this work was to design a new nanoparticle drug delivery system
for desoxycholate amphotericin B (D-AMB), based on controlled particle size,
looking for the most successful release of the active agents in order to achieve 
the best site-specific action of the drug at the therapeutically optimal rate and
dose regimen. For this, AMB nanoencapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)
(PLGA) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) nanoparticles (Nano-D-AMB) has been
developed, and its efficacy was evaluated in the treatment of experimental
cutaneous leishmaniasis in C57BL/6 mice, to test if our nano-drug delivery system
could favor the reduction of the dose frequency required to achieve the same
therapeutic level of free D-AMB, and so, an extended dosing interval. Magnetic
citrate-coated maghemite nanoparticles were added to this nanosystem
(Nano-D-AMB-MG) aiming to increase controlled release of AMB by
magnetohyperthermia. Female mice (N=6/group) were infected intradermally in the
right footpad with promastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis in the metacyclic
phase, receiving the following intraperitoneal treatments: 1% PBS for 10
consecutive days; D-AMB at 2 mg/kg/day for 10 days (totalizing 20 mg/kg/animal); 
Nano-D-AMB and Nano-D-AMB-MG at 6 mg/kg on the 1st, 4th and 7th days and at 2
mg/kg on the 10th day, also totalizing 20 mg/kg/animal by treatment end. The
Nano-D-AMB-MG group was submitted to an AC magnetic field, allowing the induction
of magnetohyperthermia. The evaluations were through paw diameter measurements;
parasite number and cell viability were investigated by limiting dilution assay. 
D-AMB-coated PLGA-DMSA nanoparticles showed the same efficacy as free D-AMB to
reduce paw diameter; however, the Nano-D-AMB treatment also promoted a
significantly greater reduction in parasite number and cell viability compared
with free D-AMB. The nano-drug AMB delivery system appeared more effective than
free D-AMB therapy to reduce the dose frequency required to achieve the same
therapeutic level. It thus favors a longer interval between doses, as expected
with development of a new nano drug delivery system, and may be useful in the
treatment of many different pathologies, from cancer to neurodegenerative
diseases.

Urinary infections in children.

Mishra OP(1), Abhinay A, Prasad R.

University, Varanasi, 221005, India, opmpedia@yahoo.co.uk.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common infection in infants and children.
During infancy, boys are more commonly affected than girls and thereafter, female
preponderance is found. Presentation varies among different age groups. Clinical 
features in neonates and young infants are non-specific, manifest as septicemia
where a high index of suspicion is needed. Older children typically present as
simple or complicated UTI. Rapid diagnosis, institution of early treatment and
further evaluation by imaging modalities are of utmost importance. The prevention
of recurrent UTI and detection of congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary
tract are major objectives in the management. Use of ultrasound is required to
detect underlying congenital abnormalities, whereas voiding cystourethrogram and 
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan are useful in the diagnosis of obstructive
uropathy and vesicoureteric reflux and renal scar, respectively. The children
requiring surgical interventions are to be recognised early to prevent recurrent 
UTI. The treatment of vesicoureteric reflux by chemoprophylaxis in lower grades
and surgical treatment in higher grades are important consideration in prevention
of recurrent UTI. This is required to prevent renal parenchymal damage and
scarring that can cause hypertension and progressive renal insufficiency in later
life.

Electronic address: huyuanqing1979@163.com.

BACKGROUND: Campylobacter jejuni is an important food-borne and zoonotic pathogen
with a worldwide distribution. Humans and chickens are hosts of this pathogen. At
present, there is no ideal vaccine for controlling human campylobacteriosis or
the carriage of C. jejuni by chickens. Bacterial in vivo-induced antigens are
useful as potential vaccine candidates and biomarkers of virulence.
METHODS: In this study, we developed a novel systematic immunoproteomics approach
to identify in vivo-induced antigens among the total cell proteins of C. jejuni
using pre-adsorbed sera from patients infected with C. jejuni.
RESULTS: Overall, 14 immunoreactive spots were probed on a PVDF membrane using
pre-adsorbed human sera against C. jejuni. Then, we excised these protein spots
from a duplicate gel and identified using MALDI-TOF MS. In total, 14 in
vivo-induced antigens were identified using PMF and BLAST analysis. The
identified proteins include CadF (CadF-1 and CadF-2), CheW, TufB, DnaK, MetK,
LpxB, HslU, DmsA, PorA, ProS, CJBH_0976, CSU_0396 and hypothetical protein
cje135_05017. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on 9 genes to compare their
expression levels in vivo and in vitro. The data showed that 8 of the 9 analyzed 
genes were significantly upregulated in vivo relative to in vitro.
CONCLUSION: We successfully developed a novel immunoproteomics method for
identifying in vivo-induced Campylobacter jejuni antigens by using pre-adsorbed
sera from infected patients.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This new analysis method may prove to be useful for
identifying in vivo-induced antigens within any host infected by bacteria and
will contribute to the development of new subunit vaccines.

The influence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) grafting on the pharmacokinetics,
biodistribution and elimination of iron oxide nanoparticles is studied in this
work. Magnetite nanoparticles (12 nm) were obtained via thermal decomposition of 
an iron coordination complex as a precursor. Particles were coated with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and conjugated to PEG-derived molecules
by 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide (EDC) chemistry. Using a rat
model, we explored the nanoparticle biodistribution pattern in blood and in
different organs (liver, spleen and lungs) after intravenous administration of
the product. The time of residence in blood was measured from the evolution of
water proton relaxivities with time and Fe analysis in blood samples. The results
showed that the residence time was doubled for PEG coated nanoparticles and
consequently particle accumulation in liver and spleen was reduced. Post-mortem
histological analyses showed no alterations in the liver and confirm
heterogeneous distribution of NPs in the organ, in agreement with magnetic
measurements and iron analysis. Finally, by successive magnetic resonance images 
we studied the evolution of contrast in the liver and measured the absorption,
time of residence and excretion of nanoparticles in the liver during a one month 
period. On the basis of these results we propose different metabolic routes that 
determine the fate of magnetic nanoparticles.

The aim of this research was to investigate zinc chromium ferrite (ZnCrFeO4)
nanoparticles, synthesized using the sol gel technique with nanoparticle size
controlled through a two-stage annealing process. Stage one was a low temperature
firing which produced low quality nanocrystals with an average size of 15 nm.
This was followed by a second firing stage at high temperature which enhanced the
crystal quality. The nanoparticles were then coated with a bio-compatible shell
to form a stable suspension in the ferrofluid carrier. The resulting
nanoparticles were found by electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and
X-ray diffraction studies to have excellent crystal quality. The average size was
8.5 nm. Preliminary cell culture studies indicated the ZnCrFeO4 nanoparticles
were non-toxic. The relatively high measured value of the relaxivity r2 showed
that the nanoparticle coating was effective in substantially reducing aggregation
and enhancing the properties of the nanoparticles associated with contrast
enhancement in MRI.

Lewisite is a potent chemical warfare arsenical vesicant that can cause severe
skin lesions. Today, lewisite exposure remains possible during demilitarization
of old ammunitions and as a result of deliberate use. Although its cutaneous
toxicity is not fully elucidated, a specific antidote exists, the British
anti-lewisite (BAL, dimercaprol) but it is not without untoward effects. Analogs 
of BAL, less toxic, have been developed such as meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA) and have been employed for the treatment of heavy metal poisoning.
However, efficacy of DMSA against lewisite-induced skin lesions remains to be
determined in comparison with BAL. We have thus evaluated in this study the
therapeutic efficacy of BAL and DMSA in two administration modes against skin
lesions induced by lewisite vapor on SKH-1 hairless mice. Our data demonstrate a 
strong protective efficacy of topical application of dimercapto-chelating agents 
in contrast to a subcutaneous administration 1h after lewisite exposure, with
attenuation of wound size, necrosis and impairment of skin barrier function. The 
histological evaluation also confirms the efficacy of topical application by
showing that treatments were effective in reversing lewisite-induced neutrophil
infiltration. This protective effect was associated with an epidermal
hyperplasia. However, for all the parameters studied, BAL was more effective than
DMSA in reducing lewisite-induced skin injury. Together, these findings support
the use of a topical form of dimercaprol-chelating agent against lewisite-induced
skin lesion within the first hour after exposure to increase the therapeutic
management and that BAL, despite its side-effects, should not be abandoned.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of
screening renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS) after initial febrile urinary tract
infection (UTI) among patients with clinically significant vesicoureteral reflux 
(VUR).
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all children <2 years of age who
presented with a febrile UTI between 2004 and 2011. The sensitivity and NPV of
initial RBUS was calculated among patients who were found to have high-grade
(IV-V) VUR. Additionally, initial RBUS among patients with evidence of photopenia
on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan or who underwent surgical intervention
were reviewed.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-four patients with febrile UTI were identified;
available RBUS, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), and DMSA results for each kidney
were reviewed. One hundred fifty-eight kidneys had evidence of VUR on VCUG, and
initial RBUS demonstrated abnormality in 25 (sensitivity 0.17). Forty-five
kidneys had high-grade VUR and RBUS revealed abnormality in 16 (sensitivity
0.36). One hundred seventy-eight kidneys had no evidence of abnormality on
initial RBUS, and 136 (76%) were found to have VUR (NPV 0.24), of which 31 had
high-grade VUR (NPV 0.83). Seven kidneys had scarring on DMSA and initial RBUS
was normal in 4 (57%). Twelve of 19 patients (63%) who eventually underwent
surgical intervention had a normal initial RBUS.
CONCLUSION: RBUS has poor sensitivity and NPV for detecting high-grade VUR in
patients <2 years who present with a febrile UTI. A significant number of
patients who were diagnosed with high-grade VUR, renal scarring, or underwent
surgical correction of VUR had a negative screening RBUS.

Objective. To determine the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy on renal
functions by using DMSA scintigraphy while considering access counts. Material
and Methods. A total of 37 patients who had undergone percutaneous
nephrolithotomy were included. Preoperative DMSA scans were performed a day
before the surgery, whereas postoperative scans were randomized by evaluating
them before (n = 25) and after (n = 12) the 6th postoperative month. Twenty-six
of 37 cases underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy with a single access site and 
11 with multiple access sites. Results. There were no significant changes of
total renal functions in the whole study group (P = 0.054). In the single access 
group, total functions were significantly elevated (P = 0.03) In the multiple
access group, while treated site functions were significantly decreased (P =
0.01), total functions did not change significantly (P = 0.42). There was an
insignificant decrease in those evaluated before the 6th postoperative month (P =
0.27) and an insignificant increase in the others (P = 0.11). Conclusion. We
could not find a superiority of single access over multiple accesses. There is a 
temporary functional loss in the treated site.

BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections are one of the most common diseases in
children. They may lead to hypertension and renal failure later in life. Renal
scintigraphy with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) is one
method used to diagnose acute pyelonephritis (APN) and renal parenchymal scars.
The aim of the present study was to determine the ideal time to perform a
follow-up 99mTc-DMSA scan to detect renal scars and also to evaluate the factors 
predicting the development of permanent renal damage after APN.
METHODS: Sixty-four children with a first episode of APN underwent a 99mTc-DMSA
scan. If there were abnormal findings on this scan, another scan was performed 6 
and 12 months later.
RESULTS: The baseline 99mTc-DMSA scan showed cortical changes in 35 patients
(54.7 %). One the 6- and 12-month follow-up scans, 25 patients (39.06 %) and 21
patients (32.8 %), respectively, had cortical lesions. In multiple logistic
regressions with the final 99mTc-DMSA scan results as the dependent variable,
only the age range of the patients (β = 1.062; 95 % CI 1.014-1.113; p = 0.01)
showed an independent and significant association. Gender, therapeutic delay
time, ultrasonography, and voiding cystourethrogram results, as well as
laboratory test results including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive 
protein level, white blood cell counts, and type of bacteria in the urine, did
not show such an association (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: There is not a significant difference between the results of 6- and
12-month 99mTc-DMSA follow-up scans. A follow-up 99mTc-DMSA scan should be
performed 12 months after the acute scan to yield a more accurate diagnosis of
permanent renal damage. If present, long-term follow-up of patients is necessary.

Facile and rapid synthesis of a dithiol-protected Ag7 quantum cluster for
selective adsorption of cationic dyes.

of Technology Madras, Chennai 600 036, India.

We report a facile and rapid (less than 15 min) synthesis of atomically precise, 
dithiol-protected, silver quantum cluster, Ag7(DMSA)4 (DMSA:
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid), through a modified solid state route. The
as-synthesized cluster exhibits molecular optical absorption features with a
prominent λmax at ~500 nm. Composition of the cluster was confirmed using various
spectroscopic and microscopic techniques such as electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry (ESI MS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction 
(XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive
analysis of X-rays (EDAX). Clusters supported on neutral alumina have been shown 
as better adsorbents for selective adsorption of cationic dyes (over anionic
dyes) from water. This selectivity for cationic dyes was evaluated by zeta
potential (ζ) measurements. The efficiency of clusters for removal of dyes is
very high when compared to nanoparticles (NPs) protected with ligands (citrate
and mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)) possessing similar chemical structures as that
of DMSA. The higher efficiency of clusters for the removal of dyes is attributed 
to their smaller size and large surface area compared to the NPs in addition to
favorable electrostatic interactions between the clusters and cationic dyes.
Adsorption of dyes (cationic and anionic) was enhanced when dye molecules contain
hydrogen bond forming functional groups. Supported clusters have been reused up
to five cycles without the loss of activity once the adsorbed dye is extracted
using suitable solvents.

INTRODUCTION: The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
introduced guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and management of urinary
tract infection (UTI) in children and adolescents in August 2007.
AIM: The primary aim was to determine whether publication of NICE guidelines was 
associated with a change in the use of diagnostic imaging investigations in
patients with a documented first UTI in a tertiary children's hospital. Secondary
aims were to describe the epidemiology, microbiology, prescription of
prophylactic antibiotics and follow-up for these children, and the incidence of
structural renal tract abnormalities, vesicoureteric reflux and renal uptake
defects identified.
METHODS: Retrospective review of the case notes of patients presenting to
Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth, Western Australia with a first UTI over a
4-year period (August 2005-2009). Details of demographics, radiological
investigations, microbiology and follow-up were obtained. Data for subjects
presenting before and after 31 August 2007 were compared.
RESULTS: Data from 659 subjects, median age 6 (range 0-186) months were analysed.
Compared with the pre-NICE period, there was no change in the proportion of
patients undergoing renal USS in the 2 years following publication of the
guidelines. There was a decrease in the proportion undergoing MCUG (p<0.0001) and
receiving antibiotic prophylaxis (p<0.0001) and an increase in the proportion
undergoing DMSA (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Practice changed following publication of the NICE guidelines. While
the reduction in MCUG requests and prescription of antibiotic prophylaxis is in
line with NICE guidelines, the increase in DMSA requests is contrary to the
recommendations.

Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in children is
still a matter of debate. In our hospital, antimicrobial treatment is initiated
intravenously, and the duration of this treatment is adapted according to the
results of a Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.
AIM: This study was conducted to evaluate retrospectively the frequency and the
importance of late renal sequelae when treating intravenously for 7 days those
patients with an abnormal acute DMSA.
METHODS: A review was conducted of the medical charts of all patients
consecutively admitted between 2005 and 2008 with positive urine culture and
clinical and biological evidence of complicated urinary tract infection (UTI).
RESULTS: There were 144 patients (59 %) with abnormal early DMSA scintigraphy and
98 (41 %) with normal scintigraphy. The median duration of intravenous treatment 
was 7.0 days in the children with DMSA lesions and 5.0 days in those without
lesions. Obvious renal sequelae were observed on late DMSA scintigraphy in 4 (6
%) out of the 65 patients with an abnormal early DMSA who came back for control
scintigraphy.
CONCLUSION: Sequelae of acute DMSA lesions observed during complicated UTI
treated 7 days intravenously were infrequent. Whether the mode and duration of
antimicrobial treatment might explain the low rate of sequelae remains to be
demonstrated.

Jolla, CA, USA.

Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are promising neuroimaging agents and molecular 
cargo across neurovascular barriers. Development of intrinsically safe IONP
chemistries requires a robust in vivo nanoneurotoxicity screening model. Herein, 
we engineered four IONPs of different surface and core chemistries: DMSA-Fe2O3,
DMSA-Fe3O4, PEG-Fe3O4 and PEG-Au-Fe3O4. Capitalizing on the ability of the
peripheral nervous system to recruit potent immune cells from circulation, we
characterized a spatiotemporally controlled platform for the study of in vivo
nanobiointerfaces with hematogenous immune cells, neuroglial and neurovascular
units after intraneural IONP delivery into rat sciatic nerve. SQUID magnetometry 
and histological iron stain were used for IONP tracking. Among the IONPs,
DMSA-Fe2O3 NPs were potent pro-apoptotic agents in nerve, with differential
ability to regulate oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptotic signaling in
neuroglia, macrophages, lymphocytes and endothelial cells. This platform aims to 
facilitate the development of predictive paradigms of nanoneurotoxicity based on 
mechanistic investigation of relevant in vivo bio-nanointerfaces.FROM THE
CLINICAL EDITOR: This team of investigators report the development of a platform 
that enables screening of iron oxide nanoparticles from the standpoint of their
potential neurotoxicity, utilizing rat sciatic nerves. Such screening tools are
clearly needed with the potential advent of iron oxide nanoparticle-based
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

(CAULE), León, Spain, luism@arrakis.es.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate if serum C-reactive protein (s-CRP) and interleukin 6
(s-IL6) provide information for predicting renal damage and for DMSA patient
selection in children with urinary tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: This observational study was carried out in children with UTI. s-CRP and
s-IL6 were measured at UTI diagnosis. Patients forming renal scarring were
identified by DMSA scans. The usefulness of s-CRP and s-IL6 measurements for
nephropathy scarring diagnosis was evaluated using diagnostic quality and
efficiency indexes.
RESULTS: Thirty-two children were included in the study. Eight showed renal
scarring after the follow-up. The s-CRP was 110.23 ± 59.69 mg/L and 52.46 ± 63.13
mg/L for patients with and without renal scarring. The s-IL6 concentration was
18.34 ± 11.80 pg/mL and 8.07 ± 9.51 pg/mL respectively. The cut-off points for
optimum nephropathy scarring diagnosis were 115 mg/L for s-CRP and 20 pg/mL for
s-IL6. The value of highest sensitivity for s-CRP was >5 mg/L (S:100 %) and
greatest specificity was >150 mg/L (Sp:95.83). The highest sensitivity for s-IL6 
was >4 pg/mL (S:100 %) and the maximum specificity was >40 pg/mL (Sp:100 %).
CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm that children who will develop renal scarring show
higher levels of s-IL6 and s-CRP at UTI diagnosis. However, none of the
techniques provide sufficient information for predicting renal damage in all
patients and for DMSA patient selection.

One major obstacle for successful application of nanoparticles in medicine is its
potential nanotoxicity on the environment and human health. In this study, we
evaluated the cytotoxicity effect of dimercaptosuccinic acid-coated iron oxide
(DMSA-Fe2O3) using cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Our results
showed that DMSA-Fe2O3 in the culture medium could be absorbed into HAECs, and
dispersed in the cytoplasm. The cytotoxicity effect of DMSA-Fe2O3 on HAECs was
dose-dependent, and the concentrations no more than 0.02 mg/ml had little toxic
effect which were revealed by tetrazolium dye assay. Meanwhile, the cell injury
biomarker, lactate dehydrogenase, was not significantly higher than that from
control cells (without DMSA-Fe2O3). However, the endocrine function for
endothelin-1 and prostacyclin I-2, as well as the urea transporter function, was 
altered even without obvious evidence of cell injury in this context. We also
showed by real-time PCR analysis that DMSA-Fe2O3 exposure resulted in
differential effects on the expressions of pro- and anti-apoptosis genes of
HAECs. Meanwhile, it was noted that DMSA-Fe2O3 exposure could activate the
expression of genes related to oxidative stress and adhesion molecules, which
suggested that inflammatory response might be evoked. Moreover, we demonstrated
by in vitro endothelial tube formation that even a small amount of DMSA-Fe2O3
(0.01 and 0.02 mg/ml) could inhibit angiogenesis by the HAECs. Altogether, these 
results indicate that DMSA-Fe2O3 have some cytotoxicity that may cause side
effects on normal endothelial cells.

Monoisoamyl 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid attenuates arsenic induced toxicity:
behavioral and neurochemical approach.

Ram Kumar M(1), Flora SJ, Reddy GR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biotechnology, Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati, Andhra
Pradesh, India.

Chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water is associated with skin lesions,
neurological effects, hypertension and high risk of cancer. The treatment in use 
at present employs administration of thiol chelators, such as
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) which are compromised with number of
limitations due to their lipophobic nature. To address this problem, therapeutic 
efficacy of monoisoamyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (MiADMSA), an analog of 
DMSA having lipophilic character, was examined against chronic arsenic poisoning 
in rats. Adult male Wistar rats were orally exposed to arsenic (2mg sodium
arsenite/kg body weight) for 10 weeks followed by treatment with MiADMSA
(50mg/kg, orally, once daily for 5 consecutive days). As-exposed rats showed
significant differences in behavioral functions (open field behavior, total
locomotor activity, grip strength and exploratory behavior) and water maze
learning. Further, the biochemical studies performed on three brain regions
(cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus) also showed significant elevation in
malondialdehyde (MDA) levels with a concomitant decrease in the oxidative stress 
marker enzymes Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase
(Cu/Zn-SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase 
(GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The alterations were more pronounced in
cortex compared to cerebellum and hippocampus. The results showed that MiADMSA
significantly reversed the As-induced alterations in behavior and biochemical
variables suggestive of oxidative injury.

suj55@yahoo.com

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been evaluated and used with technetium 99m
((99m)Tc) in imaging of kidneys. DMSA lyophilized kits were prepared and
radiolabelled with (99m)Tc. Paper and thin-layer chromatography have been
employed using various eluent systems for the radiochemical analysis, percentage 
labeling and binding capacity of (99m)Tc-DMSA. Female albino rabbits were used
for this study. Biological data obtained after intravenous injection of
radiolabelled DMSA to female albino rabbits revealed 32.42% uptake and long
retention time in the kidneys. On the basis of animal biodistribution data, it is
suggested that DMSA when labeled with (99m)Tc is useful complex for renal imaging
and can be successfully applied as a diagnostic tool in nuclear medicine.
Clinical biodistribution and radiation dosimetry studies are planned in future.

We aimed to report a healed renal parenchymal defect after 6 years in a
9-year-old girl who was being followed for recurrent urinary tract infection
(UTI). The first UTI was at the age of two. She was being followed with
ultrasonography, urine analysis and urine culture since the first UTI.
Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy was repeated four
times up to the present day. She had a renal parenchymal defect reported as
parenchymal scarring, which healed 6 years after the first DMSA
scintigraphy.CONFLICT OF INTEREST: None declared.

Balancing image quality with radiation dose is a goal with every diagnostic
procedure requiring radiation. Our institution compared the dosing of
(99m)Tc-labeled succimer, commonly referred to as dimercaptosuccinic acid
((99m)Tc-DMSA), to pediatric patients using 2 methods of calculation, body
surface area (BSA, the method we used from 2009 to 2010) and body weight (BW, the
method we used in 2011).METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in a 230-bed
inpatient, tertiary-care academic pediatric hospital to obtain objective data on 
patients under the age of 17 y who received a renal nuclear medicine procedure
with (99m)Tc-DMSA using a 300,000-count parallel image and four 150,000-count
pinhole images. Data collection included patient age, sex, height, weight,
calculated activity, assayed activity, administered activity, residual syringe
activity, imaging time, and notable patient or equipment factors affecting the
procedure.
RESULTS: Calculated activities based on BSA were higher than calculated
activities based on BW. (99m)Tc-DMSA adsorption to the plastic syringes was
significant, with a range of 3%-82%. Because of the adsorption, an average of
23.7 MBq (SD, ±31 MBq) was added to the patients' calculated dose when the order 
was placed. Therefore, assayed activities were significantly higher than
calculated activities in both groups. Administered activity correlations to BSA
and BW calculations were 0.75 and 0.83, respectively. Administered activities
from BSA and BW groups were outside the American College of Radiology
(ACR)-recommended guidelines 59% and 45% of the time, respectively. Overall,
children less than 2 y old were above the ACR recommendations 80% of the time.
There was a poor correlation between administered activity and total imaging time
(r = 0.23). Average imaging time overall for 5 planar views was 14.8 min (±7.1
min). Patients receiving less than the ACR-recommended administered activities
(<1.85 MBq/kg) had an average increase in imaging time of 4.5 min (±3.4 min).
CONCLUSION: The activity administered to patients was significantly affected by
the amount of (99m)Tc-DMSA activity adsorbed to the syringe. Syringe residual
should be considered when standardizing (99m)Tc-DMSA imaging protocols and
calculating patient dose. Although (99m)Tc-DMSA adsorption was variable, the
administered activities correlated with calculated activities. In all but one of 
our patients, the total imaging time was far less than recommended by the ACR and
European Association of Nuclear Medicine guidelines. The study indicates that
using the BW calculation of 3.7 MBq/kg resulted in a range of administered
activity of 1.85-2.59 MBq/kg. (99m)Tc-DMSA dosing of 3.7 MBq/kg for pinhole
imaging should be appropriate for most studies.

AIM: To evaluate the health related quality of life (HRQOL) after endoscopic
injection treatment for vesico ureteral reflux (VUR) in children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty four children received treatment and were
prospectively evaluated for their quality of life scores, according to resolution
of reflux on cystograms and status of renal scars.
RESULTS: Of the 81 refluxing units, 72 (89%) had resolution of reflux whereas 9
(11%) did not resolve. The total average QOL was higher for the patients in the
resolved group as compared to the non resolved group. Comparison of pre and post 
procedure renal DMSA scans in 44 patients showed status quo in 26, regression of 
scars in six, progression in two and formation of new scars in 6. The total
increase in HRQOL was highest in regression group (67.91), and lowest in
progression group (36.45).
CONCLUSIONS: Successful endoscopic treatment of VUR is associated with improved
quality of life, as indicated by higher HRQOL scores in the resolved group.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Endocrinology, Narayana Medical College and Hospital,
Chinthareddypalem, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India.

INTRODUCTION: Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a very rare genetic disorder. This
is usually characterized by asymmetry in the size of the two halves or other
parts of the body.
BACKGROUND: We are presenting a case of SRS with growth hormone (GH) deficiency
and urogenital abnormalities.
CASE REPORT: A 15-year-old boy a product of non-consanguineous marriage brought
with a history of short stature and poor development of secondary sexual
characters. There were no adverse perinatal events, but weighed 1500 g
(<3(rd)centile) at birth. He had delayed developmental milestones. He has had a
poor appetite and feeding difficulties since childhood. On physical examination, 
he had a broad forehead, triangular facies, and low-set prominent ears. Asymmetry
of the face, upper and lower extremities was noted, with hemihypertrophy on the
right side. His height was 119 cm (<3(rd)centile) and weight was 18 kg which were
low (<3(rd)centile) as per his age. He was biochemically euthyroid and GH
stimulation testing with clonidine (0.15 mg/m(2)) showed low GH levels at 30',
60', and 90' were 1.7, 1.6, and 1.1ng/ml, respectively. On
micturatingcystourethrogram, grade V complex was noted on the right side.
Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) showed normal functioning kidneys. He was started 
on recombinant GH with a height velocity of 10 cm/year.
CONCLUSION: Urogenital abnormalities are rare but well described anomalies
associated with SRS, and all cases have to be screened for them. GH deficiency is
not uncommon in SRS, and GH treatment proves to be beneficial.

Treatment outcomes according to neuropathic bladder sphincter dysfunction type
after treatment of oxybutynin chloride in children with myelodysplasia.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School 
of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

PURPOSE: We investigated the treatment outcomes according to neuropathic bladder 
sphincter dysfunction (NBSD) type after oral oxybutynin (OBT) treatment in
children with NBSD caused by myelodysplasia.
METHODS: Among 334 pediatric patients who were diagnosed with NBSD caused by
myelodysplasia, only children treated with oral OBT for more than 1 year with
pre- and post-treatment urodynamic studies and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
were retrospectively reviewed. We compared pre- and post-treatment urodynamic
parameters including maximum cystometric capacity (MCC), MCC/estimated bladder
capacity (EBC), and compliance by NBSD type in children. We also compared renal
scarring on pre- and post-treatment DMSA by NBSD type in children.
RESULTS: Our study population was comprised of 81 children (45 boys and 36
girls), with a mean age of 4.2 ± 3.4 years. The mean follow-up duration was 4.5
(range 1.0-15.1) years. After OBT treatment, MCC was increased significantly in
all types of NBSD from 110.3 ± 62.2 to 202.3 ± 103.9 ml (p < 0.05), compliance
was significantly improved from 6.4 ± 6.1 to 11.1 ± 9.6 ml/cmH2O (p < 0.05), but 
MCC/EBC was slightly decreased from 75.2 ± 46.9 to 69.8 ± 33.3 % (p = 0.40).
Sub-analyzed by NBSD type, the pre-treatment compliance of children with
acontractile detrusor with spastic sphincter (n = 16) was markedly decreased
compared with other types of NBSD. Acontractile detrusor with spastic sphincter
demonstrated the worst renal deterioration on DMSA.
CONCLUSIONS: Although increases in MCC/EBC were limited, oral OBT treatment
markedly improved MCC and compliance in all NBSD types. Children who had
acontractile detrusor with spastic sphincter had a relatively high probability of
renal deterioration and required specific attention.

Prospective study using a new bulking agent for the treatment of vesicoureteral
reflux: polyacrylamide hydrogel.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Urology, Quebec University Hospital Center, Laval University,
Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.

PURPOSE: Vesicoureteral reflux is frequently diagnosed in the pediatric
population. Endoscopic treatment has become a popular form of first-line therapy.
Available products offer good short-term success rates. However, the cost of
these injected implants is an issue. We evaluated the success of endoscopic
treatment for vesicoureteral reflux using polyacrylamide hydrogel.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a single center, single surgeon, prospective,
off-label study using polyacrylamide hydrogel to treat vesicoureteral reflux. All
patients underwent endoscopic subureteral double hydrodistention implantation
technique injection followed by renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram at 
3 months postoperatively to confirm the absence of de novo hydronephrosis and
correction of vesicoureteral reflux (grade 0).
RESULTS: A total of 40 patients (69 refluxing ureters) underwent polyacrylamide
hydrogel injection. Median age at surgery was 50 months. Bilateral reflux was
identified in 29 patients (73%). Nine patients had duplex systems, 2 with reflux 
into both moieties. Reflux was graded using the International Reflux Study in
Children grading system, with grade I seen in 9 ureters, II in 17, III in 20, IV 
in 18 and V in 5. Mean volume injected was 1.1 ml. Success rate for grade I to
III vesicoureteral reflux at 3 months after a single treatment was 87%, and the
overall success for all grades was 81.2%.
CONCLUSIONS: Off-label use of polyacrylamide hydrogel injection therapy for
primarily low grade vesicoureteral reflux demonstrates that the technique and
short-term success rates are comparable to the most popular bulking agent,
dextranomer/hyaluronic acid. These results suggest that further trials comparing 
polyacrylamide hydrogel and dextranomer/hyaluronic acid would be worthwhile.

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) exhibit tremendous potential for repair of
ischemic diseases. However, studies on the fate, migration, differentiation, and 
body distribution of the labeled ADSCs are rarely reported. In this study,
magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were designed, synthesized, and coated with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) to produce DMSA nanoparticles (DMSA-NPs).
The properties, size distribution, and characterization of DMSA-NPs were
evaluated. Green fluorescent protein expressing ADSCs (GFP-ADSCs) were obtained
and labeled with DMSA-NPs. The viability, cytotoxicity and multi-differentiation 
capacity of labeled GFP-ADSCs were evaluated in vitro. Labeled and non-labeled
GFP-ADSCs were injected into a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia, and 3T magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired. The synthesized DMSA-NPs efficiently
labeled the GFP-ADSCs in vitro and in vivo without affecting cell viability,
proliferation, cell cycle, and multi-differentiation capacity. The MRI showed
hypointense spots in the labeled GFP-ADSCs that lasted up to 8 weeks. Prussian
blue staining and immunofluorescence assay at 4 and 8 weeks indicated that the
labeled GFP-ADSCs were in and around the ischemic sites and some differentiated
into capillaries. This observation is identical to that seen for transplants of
unlabeled cells. Labeled cells were also identified mainly in the liver and
spleen, with significantly smaller amounts in the lungs, intestines, heart, and
kidney. Developed DMSA-NPs were shown to exhibit a considerable potential for use
as nanoprobes for MRI of stem cells, which will enhance our understanding of
cell-based therapeutic strategies for ischemic diseases.

Hospital, Montréal, Québec, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Many genes and loci have been reported in genetic studies of primary 
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), but few have been reproduced in independent cohorts,
perhaps because of phenotype heterogeneity. We phenotyped children with VUR who
attended urology clinics so we could establish criteria to stratify patients
based on the presence or absence of a renal malformation.
METHODS: History, chart review, and DNA were obtained for 200 children with VUR
from 189 families to determine the grade of VUR, the mode of presentation, and
the family history for each child. Kidney length measured on ultrasound (US) and 
technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans at the time of VUR diagnosis were
used to establish the presence of a concurrent renal malformation and identify
the presence of renal scarring.
RESULTS: There was an even distribution of girls and boys, and most patients were
diagnosed following a urinary tract infection (UTI). Thirty-four percent of the
children had severe VUR, and 25 % had undergone surgical correction. VUR is
highly heritable, with 15 % of the families reporting multiple affected members. 
Most patients had normally formed kidneys as determined by US and DMSA imaging.
Of the 93 patients who underwent DMSA imaging, 17 (18 %) showed scarring, 2 (2 %)
showed scarring and diffuse reduction in uptake, and 13 (14 %) showed an isolated
diffuse reduction in uptake.
CONCLUSION: Prospective long-term studies of patients with primary VUR combined
with renal phenotyping using US and DMSA imaging are needed to establish the
presence of a renal malformation. The majority of patients in our study had no
renal malformation. This cohort is a new resource for genetic studies of children
with primary VUR.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare two biologic parameters;
C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) in the detection of acute renal 
lesions assessed by DMSA scintigraphy in the urinary tract infection in child.
DESIGN: In a prospective study, serum PCT, CRP and leukocyte counts were measured
for children admitted, between January and December 2010, with a first episode of
febrile urinary tract infection.
RESULTS: Seventy-five children were enrolled in the study. Thirty-three patients 
had renal lesions (group A) and 42 had a normal DMSA scintigraphy (group B). The 
mean PCT level was significantly higher in group A than in group B (8.81 ng/mL
versus 1.7 ng/mL, P=0.01). In this study, using receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve, we identified that the optimal cut-off value with ideal sensitivity 
and specificity for PCT in detection of renal lesions was 0.76 ng/mL and for CRP,
it was 70 mg/L. The sensitivity, the negative predictive value and the indice of 
Youden of the cut-off value of PCT were significantly higher than CRP (82% versus
70%; 84% versus 70% and 0.58 versus 0.25).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that the serum PCT level was more sensitive and
specific than the CRP in the detection of renal lesions in the first urinary
tract infection in child.

A variant conferring cofactor-dependent assembly of Escherichia coli
dimethylsulfoxide reductase.

Tang H(1), Rothery RA, Weiner JH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

We have investigated the final steps of complex iron-sulfur molybdoenzyme (CISM) 
maturation using Escherichia coli DMSO reductase (DmsABC) as a model system. The 
catalytic subunit of this enzyme, DmsA, contains an iron-sulfur cluster (FS0) and
a molybdo-bis(pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide) cofactor (Mo-bisPGD). We have
identified a variant of DmsA (Cys59Ser) that renders enzyme maturation sensitive 
to molybdenum cofactor availability. DmsA-Cys59 is a ligand to the FS0 [4Fe-4S]
cluster. In the presence of trace amounts of molybdate, the Cys59Ser variant
assembles normally to the cytoplasmic membrane and supports respiratory growth on
DMSO, although the ground state of FS0 as determined by EPR is converted from
high-spin (S=3/2) to low-spin (S=1/2). In the presence of the molybdenum
antagonist tungstate, wild-type DmsABC lacks Mo-bisPGD, but is translocated via
the Tat translocon and assembles on the periplasmic side of the membrane as an
apoenzyme. The Cys59Ser variant cannot overcome the dual insults of amino acid
substitution plus lack of Mo-bisPGD, leading to degradation of the DmsABC
subunits. This indicates that the cofactor can serve as a chemical chaperone to
mitigate the destabilizing effects of alteration of the FS0 cluster. These
results provide insights into the role of the Mo-bisPGD-protein interaction in
stabilizing the tertiary structure of DmsA during enzyme maturation.

    J Pediatr Urol. 2013 Dec;9(6 Pt A):864; discussion 865-6.

PURPOSE: To determine prevalence and risk factors for renal scar in children
referred for urologic assessment of febrile UTI and/or VUR.
METHODS: Pre-determined risk factors for renal scar were prospectively recorded
in consecutive patients referred for UTI/VUR. Age, gender, VUR grade, and
reported number of febrile and non-febrile UTIs were analyzed with logistic
regression to determine risk for focal cortical defects on non-acute DMSA.
RESULTS: Of 565 consecutive children, 24 (4%) had congenital renal dysplasia and 
84 (15.5%) had focal defect(s). VUR, especially grades IV-V, recurrent febrile
UTI, and older age increased risk. For any age child with the same number of
UTIs, VUR increased odds of renal defect 5.4-fold (OR = 5.4, 95% CI = 2.7-10.6,
AUC = 0.759).
CONCLUSIONS: Focal DMSA defects were present in 15.5% of 565 consecutive children
referred for febrile UTI and/or VUR; 4% had presumed congenital reflux
nephropathy without cortical defect. All VUR grades increased risk for these
defects, as did recurrent febrile UTIs and older age. However, 43% with grades
IV-V VUR and 76% with recurrent UTI had normal DMSA.

The management of paediatric primary vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) has undergone
serial changes over the last decade. As this disorder is extremely heterogeneous,
and high-quality prospective data are limited, the treatment strategies vary
among centres. Current treatment options include observation only, continuous
antibiotic prophylaxis, and surgery. Surgical intervention is indicated if a
child has a breakthrough urinary tract infection (UTI) while on continuous
antibiotic prophylaxis or if there are renal scars present. After excluding a
secondary cause of VUR the physician should consider the risk factors affecting
the severity of VUR and manage the child accordingly. Those factors include
demographic factors (age at presentation, gender, ethnicity) and clinical factors
(VUR grade, unilateral vs. bilateral, presence of renal scars, initial
presentation, the number of UTIs, and presence of any voiding or bowel
dysfunction). In this review we summarise the major controversial issues in
current reports on VUR and highlight the importance of individualised patient
management according to their risk stratification.

[Role of procalcitonin in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children].

[Article in Chinese]

Zhang L(1), Yu Q, Guo KP, Yi SW, Li S, Mo LY.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Clinical Laboratory, Hunan Children's Hospital, Changsha, China.

OBJECTIVE: To study the role of procalcitonin (PCT) in the diagnosis of acute
pyelonephritis (APN) in children.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical records of children
aged under 3 years who were diagnosed with primary urinary tract infection (UTI) 
from September 2011 to February 2012. These children were divided into those with
upper UTI (UUTI) (APN) and those with lower UTI (LUTI) (non-APN) based on
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan results as a gold standard. The
UUTI and LUTI groups were compared in terms of serum levels of PCT and C-reactive
protein (CRP). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to
evaluate the diagnostic values of serum PCT and CRP.
RESULTS: Sixty-five children with UTI, including 39 cases of APN and 26 cases of 
LUTI, were included in this study. The APN cases had significantly higher serum
levels of PCT (3.08 ng/mL vs 0.37 ng/Ml; P<0.01) and CRP (6.25 mg/L vs 3.01 mg/L;
P<0.01) than the LUTI cases. The sensitivity and specificity of serum PCT level
for APN were 84.6% and 88.5%, respectively, with an area under the ROC curve
(AUC) of 0.873 (95%CI=0.781-0.965) and an optimal threshold point of 1.03 ng/mL. 
The sensitivity and specificity of serum CRP level for APN were 71.8% and 69.2%, 
respectively, with an AUC of 0.735 (95%CI=0.612-0.858) and an optimal threshold
point of 3.91 mg/L.
CONCLUSIONS: As a result of its high sensitivity and specificity for the disease,
serum PCT can be used as a marker in the early diagnosis of APN in children.

PURPOSE: In this study we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of renal pelvic
dilatation for detecting infants with prenatal hydronephrosis who will need
surgical intervention for ureteropelvic junction obstruction during followup.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1999 and 2010, 371 newborns diagnosed with
isolated prenatal hydronephrosis were prospectively followed. The main event of
interest was the need for pyeloplasty. Diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity,
specificity and diagnostic accuracy (assessed by AUC) of fetal renal pelvic
dilatation and postnatal renal pelvic dilatation were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 312 patients were included in the analysis and 25 (7.5%)
infants underwent pyeloplasty. The diagnostic performance for detecting the need 
for pyeloplasty was excellent for all ultrasonography measurements. The AUC was
0.96 (95% CI 0.92-0.98) for fetal renal pelvic dilatation, 0.97 (95% CI
0.95-0.98) for postnatal renal pelvic dilatation and 0.95 (95% CI 0.92-0.97) for 
the Society for Fetal Urology grading system. A cutoff of 18 mm for fetal renal
pelvic dilatation and a cutoff of 16 mm for postnatal renal pelvic dilatation had
the best diagnostic odds ratio to identify infants who needed pyeloplasty.
Considering a diagnosis to be positive only if fetal renal pelvic dilatation was 
greater than 18 mm and postnatal dilatation was greater than 16 mm, sensitivity
was 100% and specificity was 86% (95% CI 80.7-89.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the combination of fetal and postnatal
renal pelvic dilatation is able to increase the diagnostic accuracy for detecting
infants who need a more comprehensive postnatal investigation for upper urinary
tract obstruction.

PURPOSE: To report the clinical efficacy and intermediate-term functional outcome
after laparoscopic anatrophic nephrolithotomy (LAN) as an alternative treatment
modality for complete staghorn renal stone.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The demographic and perioperative parameters as well as the
intermediate outcome of 10 adults (9 men) who underwent transperitoneal LAN for
complete staghorn renal stone were analyzed. Functional imaging studies consisted
of intravenous urography (IVU) and technetium-99 dimercaptosuccinic acid
scintigraphy (99Tc-DMSA) renal scan done before the operation and at the last
follow-up visit.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 48.7 years (range 37-64 years). Mean stone size
was 67.3 mm (50-90 mm). Mean operative time was 192 minutes (110-240 min), and
mean warm ischemia time was 32.8 minutes (15-40 min). A few hours after
laparoscopy, one patient underwent splenectomy because of significant hemorrhage 
from a splenic laceration (grade IIIb complication). During the follow-up period 
early after the operation, we detected an 8-mm lower caliceal stone and a 25-mm
midcaliceal stone in one patient each (stone-free rate: 80%). After a mean
follow-up of 11.9 months (6-19 mos), 85.5% of corresponding renal unit function
was preserved; however, there was a significant mean decrease in 99Tc-DMSA uptake
from 48.4%±8.83 before surgery to 41.4%±13.98 afterward (-7%±6.53; P=0.008).
Nevertheless, renal units were completely functional at follow-up IVU with a
significant improvement in obstruction in all patients.
CONCLUSION: LAN is an alternative minimally invasive approach for one-session
management of patients with complete staghorn renal stone. It offers an
acceptable rate of stone clearance and operative complications but does incur a
minimal loss of function in the affected kidney.

We describe a case of lead poisoning in a worker after hand and forearm trauma
with fracture of radius and multiple fractures of metacarpal bones and hand
phalanges and tissue infiltration of lead oxide (PbO) paste. Orthopedic surgery
was immediately performed. After 20 days the patient had abdominal colic pain
episodes and severe stipsis and blood lead level (BLL) was 60 mcg/mL with urinary
lead level (ULL) of 238 mcg/24 h. After mobilization test with calcium disodium
edetate were observed a high increase of BLL (180 mcg/dL) and UBL (17,000
mcg/24h). An initial anemia was observed and became severe (Hb 7.6 g/dL). A NMR
exam and echography showed forearm subcutaneous lead paste infiltration and the
patient underwent to a second surgical debridement with local low temperature (5 
degrees C) irrigation of saline and CaNa2EDTA made the removal of the hardened
lead paste. The day after, oral succimer (DMSA) chelation treatment was started
with recovery of lead poison.

Toxicology & German Medical Association of Clinical Metal Toxicology, Hersbruck, 
Germany.

OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study was to provide evidence that DMSA detoxification
treatments cause a reduction of the heavy metal burden in the autistic, and that 
this reduction lessens neurological symptoms associated with ASD (Autistic
Spectrum Disorder).
METHOD: The participants were 44 children, age 3 to 9 years of age, with Autistic
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders 4t Edition, (DMS-IV). The severity of the autistics symptomatologiy had
been measured by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (SCARS). We collected urine
samples before and after the DMSA challenge test, comparing urine metal output.
We also compared the results of the DMSA detoxification(=the urine challenge
test) with behavioral effects, typical for ASD.
RESULTS: The DMSA challenge test increased the urine metal output for a number of
potentially toxic metals. Statistically significant difference were noted between
the baseline urine and DMSA challenge test regarding the level of cadmium,
mercury, and lead (P=0.006, P=0.049, and P=0.008 respectively). We also noted
that behavioral effects, typical for ASD (autism spectrum disorders) were reduced
with this method of detoxification. A comparison between CARS Subscales and Total
Score before and after a 6-month chelation program showed greatest improvements
for Verbal and nonverbal communication (P <0.001), Taste, Smell and Touch (P
0.001) and Relating to People (P 0.005). Other improvements were noted for
Adaptation to Change and Improvement.
CONCLUSION: DMSA chelation increased the urinary output of toxic and neurotoxic
metals. Our data supports evidence that detoxification treatment with oral DMSA
has beneficial effect on ASD patients.

In busy nuclear medicine departments, the F+0 protocol for diuretic renography is
routinely used to shorten the acquisition time. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the influence of the F+0 protocol on the split renal function (SRF)
during a dynamic renal scan using technetium-99m diethylene triamine pentaacetic 
acid (Tc-DTPA) compared with that using the standard technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-DMSA). A total of 102 patients referred for a dynamic
renal scan for varied etiologies were divided into two groups: the F+0 group,
comprising 53 patients who were injected with furosemide just before Tc-DTPA
injection, and the F+10 group, comprising 49 patients who were injected with the 
diuretic at the 10th minute after radiotracer injection. All patients were also
subjected to a static cortical Tc-DMSA scan with geometric quantification of SRF.
A highly significant statistical difference (P<0.001) was obtained on comparing
the mean value of the difference in SRF calculated using DTPA and DMSA between
the F+0 and F+10 groups, being 5.0±2.6 and 1.5±0.6%, respectively. All 49
patients in the F+10 group had a difference in split function of 5% or less,
whereas 17/53 patients representing 32.1% of the F+0 group had a difference in
SRF of greater than 5%. Early (F+0) furosemide injection before administration of
Tc-DTPA has a significant influence on the estimation of SRF of the diseased
kidney (either obstructed or functionally impaired) when compared with furosemide
injection after standard Tc-DMSA administration. Care should be taken during
interpretation of the scan findings when accurate split function is required.

Arsenic induced neuronal apoptosis in guinea pigs is Ca2+ dependent and abrogated
by chelation therapy: role of voltage gated calcium channels.

Arsenic contaminated drinking water has affected more than 200 million people
globally. Chronic arsenicism has also been associated with numerous neurological 
diseases. One of the prime mechanisms postulated for arsenic toxicity is reactive
oxygen species (ROS) mediated oxidative stress. In this study, we explored the
kinetic relationship of ROS with calcium and attempted to dissect the calcium ion
channels responsible for calcium imbalance after arsenic exposure. We also
explored if mono- or combinational chelation therapy prevents arsenic-induced
(25ppm in drinking water for 4 months) neuronal apoptosis in a guinea pig animal 
model. Results indicate that chronic arsenic exposure caused a significant
increase in ROS followed by NO and calcium influx. This calcium influx is mainly 
dependent on L-type voltage gated channels that disrupt mitochondrial membrane
potential, increase bax/bcl2 levels and caspase 3 activity leading to apoptosis. 
Interestingly, blocking of ROS could completely reduce calcium influx whereas
calcium blockage partially reduced ROS increase. While in general mono- and
combinational chelation therapies were effective in reversing arsenic induced
alteration, combinational therapy of DMSA and MiADMSA was most effective. Our
results provide evidence for the role of L-type calcium channels in regulating
arsenic-induced calcium influx and DMSA+MiADMSA combinational therapy may be a
better protocol than monotherapy in mitigating chronic arsenicosis.

PURPOSE: The association of vesicoureteral reflux, febrile urinary tract
infections and renal parenchymal damage is well recognized. We determined the
prevalence and predictors of renal functional abnormalities in children with high
grade vesicoureteral reflux.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and
dimercapto-succinic acid scans of 774 consecutive children with primary high
grade vesicoureteral reflux (grade IV-V) seen at our institution between 1998 and
2011. For multivariate analysis we analyzed variables associated with renal
functional abnormalities, such as presentation history, age, gender and reflux
grade, in a logistic regression model.
RESULTS: Of the children 698 (90%) and 76 (10%) had grade IV and V reflux,
respectively. Dimercapto-succinic acid scans revealed renal functional
abnormalities in 291 children (37.6%), including 240 (34%) with grade IV and 51
(67%) with grade V reflux. Univariate analysis showed that age greater than 1
year (OR 2.95, p <0.001), grade V reflux (OR 4.09, p <0.001) and preoperative
bladder/bowel dysfunction (OR 2.94, p = 0.026) were significant predictors of
renal functional abnormalities. Multivariate analysis showed that age greater
than 1 year (OR 3.45, p = 0.001) and grade V reflux (OR 5.89, p <0.001) were the 
most significant independent predictors of such abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of renal functional abnormalities in
children older than 1 year and those with grade V vesicoureteral reflux. Patients
with a history of bladder/bowel dysfunction are also at greater risk for such
abnormalities. The early detection and treatment of high grade vesicoureteral
reflux may prevent acquired renal parenchymal damage and limit the progression of
renal damage in patients with congenital reflux nephropathy.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the ability of acute (99m)Tc DMSA scan for
predicting dilating (grades III-V) vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) after a first
febrile urinary tract infection in children aged 2 years or younger.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All children underwent ultrasonography (US), (99m)Tc DMSA
scan, and voiding cystourethrography. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and
negative predictive values, likelihood ratios, and receiver operating
characteristic curves were performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy for
predicting dilating VUR. Follow-up scan was performed at least 6 months after the
acute infection to evaluate the presence of renal scarring (RS) or new scars.
RESULTS: Of the 473 children analyzed (289 boys and 184 girls; median age, 5
months), 282 (59.6%) had abnormal acute (99m)Tc DMSA scan findings. There was VUR
in 153 children (32.3%), whereas 95 (20.1%) had dilating VUR. The sensitivity and
negative predictive value in predicting dilating VUR were 95.8% and 97.9%,
respectively, for (99m)Tc DMSA and 97.9% and 98.6%, respectively, for combined US
and (99m)Tc DMSA, whereas the positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.90
and 0.08, respectively, for (99m)Tc DMSA and 1.57 and 0.06, respectively, for
combined studies. On multivariate analysis, dilating VUR was a predictor for
developing RS and new scars.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the usefulness of acute (99m)Tc DMSA scan for
predicting dilating VUR in children with a first febrile urinary tract infection.
A voiding cystourethrography is indicated in only children with abnormalities
found on a (99m)Tc DMSA and/or a US. The presence of dilating VUR predisposes to 
developing RS and new scars.

PURPOSE: The AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) no longer recommends voiding
cystourethrogram in children 2 to 24 months old who present with a first urinary 
tract infection if renal-bladder ultrasound is normal. We identified factors
associated with abnormal imaging and recurrent pyelonephritis in this population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated children diagnosed with a
first episode of pyelonephritis at age 2 to 24 months using de-identified
electronic medical record data from an institutional database. Data included age 
at first urinary tract infection, gender, race/ethnicity, need for
hospitalization, intravenous antibiotic use, history of abnormal prenatal
ultrasound, renal-bladder ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram results,
urinary tract infection recurrence and surgical intervention. Risk factors for
abnormal imaging and urinary tract infection recurrence were analyzed by
univariate logistic regression, the chi-square test and survival analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 174 patients. Of the 154 renal-bladder ultrasounds
performed 59 (38%) were abnormal. Abnormal prenatal ultrasound (p = 0.01) and the
need for hospitalization (p = 0.02) predicted abnormal renal-bladder ultrasound. 
Of the 95 patients with normal renal-bladder ultrasound 84 underwent voiding
cystourethrogram. Vesicoureteral reflux was more likely in patients who were
white (p = 0.003), female (p = 0.02) and older (p = 0.04). Despite normal
renal-bladder ultrasound, 23 of 84 patients (24%) had dilating vesicoureteral
reflux. Of the 95 patients with normal renal-bladder ultrasound 14 (15%) had
recurrent pyelonephritis and 7 (7%) went on to surgical intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite normal renal-bladder ultrasound after a first pyelonephritis
episode, a child may still have vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent pyelonephritis
and the need for surgical intervention. If voiding cystourethrogram is deferred, 
parents should be counseled on these risks.

PURPOSE: To examine whether (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA could be used as a non-invasive
measure of cancer cell proliferation.
METHODS: Human breast cancer MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and pII, and prostate cancer PC-3 
cell lines were grown to 30, 50 and 100% confluency and pulsed with
(99m)Tc(V)-DMSA in media for 60 min at 37°C. DNA synthesis was analysed by
quantification of the S phase using flow cytometry, [methyl-(3)H]thymidine
incorporation and expression of proliferation markers PCNA and Ki-67 using
realtime PCR. One way ANOVA was used to compare groups.
RESULTS: In all cell lines rates of (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA uptake were inversely related
to cell density. This was paralleled by similar trends in S phase proportions,
[methyl-(3)H]thymidine incorporation and expression of PCNA and Ki-67.
CONCLUSION: Rates of (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA uptake into different types of tumour cells 
correlate well with cell density that is useful as a non-invasive measure of
tumour cellular proliferation in vivo.

NICE guidelines for imaging studies in children with UTI adequate only in boys
under the age of 6 months.

Ristola MT(1), Hurme T.

Author information: 
(1)Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland. mtrist@utu.fi

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for
imaging studies in children under the age of three with first urinary tract
infection (UTI).
METHODS: In our cohort of 112 patients, we gathered data regarding the occurrence
of indications for ultrasonography (US) and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG)
according to the NICE guidelines, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy
examinations, UTI recurrence, antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP), anti-reflux
procedures, and other urological procedures.
RESULTS: If the NICE guidelines had been applied, 13 of the 25 patients (52 %)
with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), including 6 of the 12 patients (50 %) with
dilating VUR and 3 of the 4 patients who underwent endoscopic anti-reflux
treatment, would have been missed, and a negative VCUG would have been avoided in
25 of the 42 patients (60 %) with no VUR. None of the missed diagnoses occurred
in the younger boys' group.
CONCLUSION: Based on these preliminary analyses, we feel that the NICE guidelines
for imaging studies in children under 3 years old with UTI may be applicable to
clinical use only in boys under 6 months of age. For other patients the
guidelines were unsuccessful.

BACKGROUND: Abnormal Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy performed 
six months after an acute pyelonephritis (AP) is generally interpreted as
scarring.
AIM: To perform a follow up of childhood patients showing scintigraphic renal
lesions during the acute phase of pyelonephritis (within 7 days from the
beginning of fever).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A scintigraphic control was carried out at 5-7 months and, 
in case of persistent lesions, an additional late scintigraphy at 10-13 months.
All patients were followed clinically for one year and those with a relapse of
urinary tract infection were excluded from the study.
RESULTS: Eighty five patients with a median age of 8 months were included. Among 
these, the first scintigraphic control was normal in 59 (69%) and abnormal in 26 
patients (31%). In five of these 26 patients (5/26:19%-5/85: 6%), a considerable 
regression of the lesions was obvious on the early control, and normalized
completely on the late control. When expressing the results in kidney units, 107 
showed lesions during the acute phase of infection; 69% was normal at the early
control. Thirty three showed lesions persisting at the early control (31%) and 7 
out of these 33 (21%) became normal on the late control (7/107: 7%). In total,
25% of the children included in the study (24% of the kidney units) remained with
renal sequelae one year after the initial episode of AP.
CONCLUSIONS: The persistence of scintigraphic lesions six months after an episode
of AP, does not necessarily correspond to permanent scars, since normalization
can sometimes be observed on late controls.

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) affects ∼1% of children. We present an unusual case
of urinary retention secondary to an obstructing urethral stone, underlying
reflux, and its management. A 7-year-old boy presenting with acute urinary
retention had a palpable penile shaft swelling and patent urethral meatus on
examination. Cysto-urethroscopy with a 6.6Fr ureteroscope, due to unavailability 
of paediatric instruments, revealed an obstructing calculus impacted in the
navicular fossa. This was laser fragmented and extracted. Cystoscopy revealed
multiple bladder calculi with a patulous right ureteric orifice. Post-operative
investigations revealed a small, scarred right kidney (ultrasound), bilateral
ureteric reflux (micturating-cystourethrogram), 4 cm by 0.8 cm right ureteric
calculus (CT-KUB) and 4% right split renal function (DMSA). Right laparoscopic
nephroureterectomy was subsequently performed. Our case highlights the variety
with which VUR can present and the effectiveness of a ureteroscope in an
emergency setting as an alternative to a paediatric cystoscope to visualize the
urethra and the bladder.

Renal uptake of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid is dependent on normal proximal
tubule receptor-mediated endocytosis.

(99m)Tc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) accumulates in the kidney 
cortex and is widely used for imaging of the renal parenchyma. Despite its
extensive clinical use, the mechanism for renal targeting of the tracer is
unresolved. Megalin and cubilin are cooperating receptors essential to the
proximal tubule endocytic uptake of proteins from the glomerular ultrafiltrate.
We have used megalin/cubilin-deficient mice produced by gene knockout to
determine whether receptor-mediated endocytosis is responsible for the renal
uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA.METHODS: Control or megalin/cubilin-deficient mice were
injected intravenously with 0.5 MBq of (99m)Tc-DMSA or
(99m)Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3). Whole-body scintigrams and the activity 
in plasma, urine, and the kidneys were examined 6 h after injection. The size and
identity of (99m)Tc-DMSA-bound proteins in urine were analyzed by fractionation
by centrifugation and separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography and mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: No renal accumulation of (99m)Tc-DMSA was identified in scintigrams of
megalin/cubilin-deficient mice. The renal accumulated activity of the tracer was 
reduced to 11.4% (± 2.5%, n = 7) of the normal uptake in control mice,
correlating with a reduction in renal megalin/cubilin expression in knockout mice
to about 10% of normal. The reduced renal uptake in megalin/cubilin-deficient
mice was accompanied by an increase in the urinary excretion of (99m)Tc-DMSA.
Size separation of the urine by ultracentrifugation and sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that in megalin/cubilin-deficient
mice an increased amount of (99m)Tc-DMSA was excreted in an approximately 27-kDa 
form, which by mass spectrometry was identified as the plasma protein
α1-microglobulin, an established megalin/cubilin ligand.
CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-DMSA is filtered bound to α1-microglobulin and accumulates in
the kidneys by megalin/cubilin-mediated endocytosis of the (99m)Tc-DMSA protein
complex. Renal accumulation of (99m)Tc-DMSA is thus critically dependent on
megalin/cubilin receptor function and therefore is a marker of proximal tubule
endocytic activity.

vesicoureteric reflux: association with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid
scans.

OBJECTIVE: Positioning irrigation of contrast (PIC) cystography identifies occult
or PIC vesicoureteral reflux (PIC-VUR) in children with recurrent febrile urinary
tract infections (UTI) but no vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) on standard voiding
cystourethrogram (VCUG). We sought to identify the relationship between PIC-VUR
and renal scarring in technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed PIC cystograms and DMSA scans
for 154 kidneys in 81 children (65 girls; 16 boys; median age, 4.7 years; range, 
0.9-15.2). Renal scarring was graded on a scale of 0-3. DMSA scans were
pathologic in 66 patients (81%). Children had experienced mean 3.8 febrile UTI
(range 1-25). Forty-seven (58%) children had a history of reflux, including 15
(19%) with previous anti-reflux operations. Indications for PIC cystography were 
recurrence of febrile UTI after either bilateral negative VCUG (66 children) or
unilateral VUR (15 children) with contralateral/bilateral scarring or reflux that
had changed sides in subsequent VCUGs.
RESULTS: PIC-VUR was bilateral in 63, unilateral in 12, and absent in 6 children.
Statistically significant associations between PIC-VUR grade and severity of
renal scarring were identified in inter-individual (n = 77, p = 0.017) and
intra-individual (refluxing vs. nonrefluxing kidney; n = 12, p = 0.008) analyses.
After excluding patients with history of VUR, statistical significance was
maintained in inter-individual analysis (n = 49; p = 0.018).
CONCLUSION: The data suggest an association between PIC-VUR and severity of renal
scarring, and legitimise the use of PIC cystography in children with renal
scarring due to recurrent febrile UTI but negative findings on VCUG.

Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate)
hydrogels loaded with silica shell cross-linked methoxy(polyethylene
glycol)-block-polycaprolactone (MePEG-b-PCL) micelles with rod-like morphology
were prepared as a potential soft contact lens material for the sustained release
of ocular drugs. The silica shell cross-linked methoxy micelles (SSCMs)
comprising a polycaprolactone core surrounded by a silica shell were synthesized 
and their size, morphology, stability, and drug release kinetics were evaluated. 
The relationships between the composition of the SSCM-loaded poly(2-hydroxyethyl 
methacrylate) (pHEMA)-based hydrogels and their transparency, surface
wettability, and equilibrium water content were determined. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of SSCM-hydrogel systems showed the presence of intact
SSCMs within the hydrogel matrix. Dexamethasone acetate (DMSA), a hydrophobic
ophthalmic drug, was loaded into the SSCMs prior to their incorporation into the 
hydrogels. In vitro release of DMSA from the SSCM-hydrogels, with varying drug
loading levels, was observed for up to 30 days. Overall, the incorporation of
rod-like SSCMs within pHEMA-based hydrogels provided sustained release over
prolonged periods while maintaining optical transparency. This delivery system
may be suitable for use as a therapeutic soft contact lens material.

OBJECTIVE: The role of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy in the
first episode of urinary tract infection (UTI) has been the subject of debate for
many years. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of voiding
cystourethrography (VCUG), renal ultrasonography and DMSA renal scintigraphy and 
to detect renal parenchymal changes by performing DMSA renal scintigraphy at 6
months after the first episode of UTI.
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in 67 hospitalized children (46 boys, 
21 girls). Mean age of the patients was 0.97 ± 1.57 years (0.02-7.26 years). All 
children received VCUG, renal ultrasonography and DMSA renal scintigraphy. DMSA
renal scintigraphy was performed at 1 and 6 months after UTI.
RESULTS: Of 67 children, 17 (25.4%), 23 (34.3%) and 20 (29.9%) had vesicoureteral
reflux (VUR), abnormal renal ultrasonography and abnormal DMSA renal
scintigraphy, respectively. Unilateral hydronephrosis had a significant
correlation with VUR at p value 0.024. In renal units, abnormal renal
ultrasonography and hydronephrosis had significant correlations with VUR at p
values 0.039 and 0.021, respectively. In patients and renal units, hydronephrosis
had no significant correlation with abnormal DMSA renal scintigraphy at 1 month
after UTI. However, abnormal renal ultrasonography and VUR had significant
correlations with abnormal DMSA renal scintigraphy at p values 0.022 and < 0.001 
in patients and at p values 0.024 and < 0.001 in renal units, respectively. Both 
in patients and renal units, VUR (Grade I-III) had no significant correlation
with abnormal DMSA renal scintigraphy. However, severe VUR (Grade IV-V) had
significant correlations with abnormal DMSA renal scintigraphy at p values <
0.001 and < 0.001, respectively. Seventeen patients underwent DMSA renal
scintigraphy at 6 months after UTI. In addition, 15 (88.2%) developed persistent 
renal scarring.
CONCLUSION: Abnormal renal ultrasonography and severe VUR identify renal
parenchymal changes. DMSA renal scintigraphy in the first episode of UTI should
be carried out in those patients. Abnormal DMSA renal scintigraphy at 1 month
after UTI has a tendency to persist.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common sources of bacterial
infections among young febrile children. Accurate diagnosis of acute
pyelonephritis (APN) and vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) are important because of
their association with renal scarring, sometimes leading to long-term
complications. However, the gold standard examinations are either a DMSA scan for
APN and scarring, or cystography for VUR, but both present limitations
(feasibility, pain, cost, etc.). Procalcitonin, a reliable marker of bacterial
infections, was demonstrated to be a good predictor of renal parenchymal
involvement in the acute phase and in late renal scars, as well as of high-grade 
VUR. These findings need further broad validations and impact studies before
being implemented into daily practice. However, procalcitonin may play a role in 
the complex and still debated picture of which examination should be performed
after UTI in children.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the reflux nephropathy rate and severity as well as the
hypertension rate in pediatric patients with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
METHODS: The study included 240 patients with VUR. Renal scarring (RS) was
demonstrated by renal parenchymal examination using technetium-99m-labeled
dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scintigraphy. Office measurements of
arterial blood pressure and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) of VUR
patients were done during the follow-up period.
RESULTS: Follow-up was a mean duration of 24 months. Rates of RS and hypertension
increased parallel to increases in the degree of VUR. A gradual elevation in
hypertension rates was evident during the follow-up period. All patients with
hypertension had RS. Severe RS in 56 patients was associated with increasing
blood pressure readings by 24-hour ABPM or office measurements in 19 patients
(33.9%). ABPM measurements enabled us to detect additional patients compared with
office measurements alone.
CONCLUSION: Hypertension is a serious complication in children with reflux
nephropathy and is associated with the severity of RS and VUR grade. ABPM seems
to be superior over office measurements of blood pressure in identifying patients
with hypertension.

Abnormal dimercaptosuccinic Acid scan may be related to persistence of
vesicoureteral reflux in children with febrile urinary tract infection.

Korea.

PURPOSE: This study assessed whether (99m)technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scintigraphy used for the assessment of renal sequelae after febrile
urinary tract infection (UTI) has any prognostic value for outcome measurement of
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) by retrospectively evaluating the correlation between
abnormal DMSA scintigraphy results and persistence of VUR in children with
febrile UTI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 142 children (57 boys, 85 girls)
admitted with febrile UTI from January 2004 to December 2006 and who were
followed up for more than 1 year were retrospectively reviewed. At the initial
and follow-up visits, renal ultrasound and DMSA scans were performed within 7
days from the diagnosis and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed
within 1 month in all case and follow-up evaluations.
RESULTS: The children's mean age was 4.8±3.6 years (range, 0.3 to 14 years). The 
mean follow-up was 28.2±4.8 months. At the initial examination, VUR was more
often associated with an abnormal DMSA scan result (83.3%) than with a normal
DMSA scan result (16.7%, p=0.02). The frequency of VUR with an abnormal DMSA scan
during acute UTI was significantly higher than the frequency of VUR with a normal
DMSA scan (38.8% vs, 25.8%, respectively, p=0.004). Also, high-grade VUR was
associated with an abnormal DMSA scan result (32.5%) more often than with a
normal DMSA scan result (0%, p=0.01). Children with an abnormal DMSA scan had a
lower resolution rate of VUR (17.5%) than did children with a normal DMSA scan
(75.0%) at the follow-up VCUG (p=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal result on a DMSA scan during febrile UTI is associated
with high-grade and persistent VUR. DMSA scans performed during febrile UTI are
useful in reflux resolution in childhood.

Effects of DMSA-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the transcription of genes related 
to iron and osmosis homeostasis.

Liu Y(1), Wang J.

Author information: 
(1)State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, 
China.

In this article, we checked the effect of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid-coated
Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles on gene expression of mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells and
found that the transcription of several important genes related to intracellular 
iron homeostasis were significantly changed. We thus speculated that the cellular
iron homeostasis might be disturbed by this nanoparticle through releasing iron
ion in cells. To verify this speculation, we first confirmed the transcriptional 
changes of several key iron homeostasis- related genes, such as Tfrc, Trf, and
Lcn2, using quantitative PCR, and found that an iron ion chelator,
desferrioxamine, could alleviate the transcriptional alterations of two typical
genes, Tfrc and Lcn2. Then, we designed and validated a method based on
centrifugation for assaying intracellular irons in ion and nanoparticle state.
After extensive measures of intracellular iron in two forms and total iron, we
found that the intracellular iron ion significantly increased with intracellular 
total iron and nanoparticle iron, demonstrating degradation of this nanoparticle 
into iron ion in cells. We next mimicked the intralysosomal environment in vitro 
and verified that the internalized iron nanoparticle could release iron ion in
lysosome. We found that as another important compensatory response to
intracellular overload of iron ion, cells significantly downregulated the
expressions of genes belonging to solute carrier family which are responsible for
transferring many organic solutes into cells, such as Slc5a3 and Slc44a1, in
order to prevent more organic solutes into cells and thus lower the intracellular
osmosis. Based on these findings, we profiled a map of gene effects after cells
were treated with this iron nanoparticle and concluded that the iron
nanoparticles might be more detrimental to cell than iron ion due to its
intracellular internalization fashion, nonspecific endocytosis.

Urinary tract infection in infants: a single-center clinical analysis in southern
Taiwan.

Wu JH(1), Chiou YH, Chang JT, Wang HP, Chen YY, Hsieh KS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Su-Ao Branch of Taipei Veterans General Hospital,
Yi-lan, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: This study summarized the epidemiology, etiology, and susceptibility 
of pathogens to antibiotics, and specific characteristics in infants aged less
than 4 months diagnosed with urinary tract infection in the past decade in
Taiwan.
METHODS: The medical charts of patients aged less than 4 months admitted for
urinary tract infection to Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital between January
2001 and December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: A total of 132 patients, with male predominance (68.9%), were enrolled. 
The top three pathogens were similar to those identified in previous studies in
Taiwan. The most common pathogen, Escherichia coli (85.3%), was resistant to
ampicillin (75.9%), followed by sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (31.7%), and
cefazolin (28.5%). Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan revealed 34.5%
positive findings, while the vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) rate was 37.8% by direct
radionuclide voiding cystography and/or voiding cysto-urethrography. Positive
DMSA findings significantly correlated with VUR (p<0.001) and higher C-reactive
protein level (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: E coli was the most common pathogen in the present cohort, and the
top three pathogens were similar to those found in general pediatric population
in Taiwan. VUR was the most common genitourinary tract anomaly in this age group.
Positive DMSA was well correlated with VUR and higher C-reactive protein level.

Monitoring of renal function using 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy in
patients with spinal cord injury.

Tuna H(1), Cermik TF, Tuna F.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physician Medicine and Rehabilitation, Hospital of the
University of Trakya, Edirne, Turkey.

AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the degree of alterations of renal
function by using 99m-technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) and
99m-technetium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ((99m)Tc-DTPA) scintigraphy in 
spinal cord injury (SCI) patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive SCI (15 paraplegic and 7
tetraplegic) patients (mean age: 49.1±13.4 years) who had no urinary symptoms
participated in this prospective study. The mean duration of injury was 45.6±48.8
months before. Sixteen patients had at least one urinary tract infection history.
Renal cortical scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-DMSA, radionuclide renography with
(99m)Tc-DTPA and renal ultrasound were performed within 2-week period.
RESULTS: Four (18%) patients had serious pathology on their kidneys such as
unilateral or bilateral parenchymal scarring and increased background uptake in
their renal cortical scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-DMSA. Two of them had grade 3-4
pelvicaliceal ectasia on ultrasound. Additionally, 2 of 18 remaining patients had
grade 2 pelvicaliceal ectasia on ultrasound. Sixteen (73%) patients had markedly 
delayed or delayed and decreased functions of one or both of kidneys on
radionuclide renography. However, only four patients had grade 2-4 pelvicaliceal 
ectasia and none of them had a finding of loosening of renal parenchyma.
CONCLUSION: Combined use of renal cortical scintigraphy and radionuclide
renography appears to be contributive to renal ultrasound in the long-term
follow-up of patients with SCI. Patients with abnormal findings should be closely
followed, and early therapeutic interventions may enable lower morbidity and
mortality rates in these patients.

Prediction of vesicoureteral reflux in children with first urinary tract
infection by dimercaptosuccinic Acid and ultrasonography.

Author information: 
(1)Non communicable Pediatric Disease Research Center, Babol Medical University, 
Iran ; Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Amirkola Children Hospital, Babol
Medical University, Iran.

OBJECTIVE: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common causes of
febrile pediatric diseases. Also, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a significant
risk factor for UTI. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is the method of choice
for evaluation of VUR. This study was done to predict VUR by DMSA scan
(technetium 99 m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid) and ultrasonography (US).
METHODS: In a prospective study, all children with first time acute
pyelonephritis were selected and evaluated by DMSA scan and US. Then VCUG was
done with negative urine culture. All children with final diagnosis of
obstructive congenital anomaly were excluded. The sensitivity, specifity,
positive predictive values, negative predictive values, Confidence Interval of
DMSA scan and US were calculated for prediction or exclusion of VUR.
FINDINGS: Among 100 children with UTI diagnosis, VUR was detected in 39 children 
and 63 (31.5%) kidneys. DMSA scan was abnormal in 103 (51.5%) units, 45 units had
VUR (PPV=44%), 79 units with normal DMSA scan had no VUR (NPV=81%). Of kidney
units that were abnormal by DMSA or US, 51 units had VUR. PPV and NPV were 44%
and 56%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: DMSA scan alone or with US cannot predict VUR (especially low grade
VUR). But according to NPV, it seems that absence of VUR can be predicted. So,
more studies are needed to determine the usefulness of DMSA scan and US instead
of VCUG for detection of VUR.

BACKGROUND: Numerous factors may contribute to renal tissue injury after urinary 
tract infection. We have evaluated the effects of vitamins A or E supplementation
in combination with antibiotics for the prevention of renal scarring in acute
pyelonephritis.
METHODS: A simple non-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on 61
children aged 1 month to 10 years between 2004 and 2006. The inclusion criteria
were positive urine culture, clinical findings, and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scintigraphy-based evidence in favor of acute pyelonephritis. The children
were randomized into three treatment groups: 10-day treatment with only
antibiotics (control group; n = 25) and 10-day treatment with supplements of
vitamin A (n = 17) or vitamin E (n = 18) in addition to antibiotics during the
acute phase of infection. The final analysis was performed after excluding male
patients. Each patient was evaluated twice by 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy performed
at least 6 months apart. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS: The analysis included 108 kidney units. The frequency of inflammation at
the beginning of therapy was not significantly different in the three groups
(63.3 % in vitamin A, 61 % in vitamin E, and 76.2 % in the control group). A
worsening of lesions, based on the second 99mTc-DMSA scan, was observed in 42.5, 
0, and 23.3 % of the control, vitamin E, and vitamin A patients, respectively
(LR = 26.3, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Vitamins A or E supplements were effective in reducing renal scarring
secondary to acute pyelonephritis.

Manganese oxide (MnO) nanoparticles have been suggested as a promising "positive"
MRI contrast agent for cellular and molecular studies. Mn-based contrast agents
could enable T(1)-weighted quantitative cell tracking procedures in vivo based on
signal enhancement. In this study, ultrasmall MnO particles were synthesized and 
coated with thiolated molecules (DMSA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to allow
enhanced cell labeling properties and colloidal stability. This coating allowed
the fabrication of individual ultrasmall nanoparticles of MnO (USPMnO) as well as
of nanoaggregates of the same material (SPMnO). Particle size was measured by TEM
and DLS. Physico-chemical properties were characterized by XPS and FTIR. The
relaxometric properties of these aqueous suspensions were measured at various
magnetic fields. The suspensions provided strong positive contrast enhancement in
T(1)-weighted imaging due to high longitudinal relaxivities (r(1)) and low
r(2)/r(1) ratios (USPMnO: r(1) = 3.4 ± 0.1 mM(-1)s(-1), r(2)/r(1) = 3.2; SPMnO:
r(1) = 17.0 ± 0.5 mM(-1)s(-1), r(2)/r(1) = 4.0, at 1.41T). HT-1080 cancer cells
incubated with the contrast agents were clearly visualized in MRI for Mn contents
>1.1 pg Mn/cell. The viability of cells was not affected, contrarily to cells
labeled with an equivalent concentration of Mn(2+) ions. A higher signal per cell
was found for SPMnO-labeled compared with USPMnO-labeled cells, due to the higher
relaxometric properties of the agglomerates. As a result, the "positive" signal
enhancement effect is not significantly affected upon agglomeration of MnO
particles in endosomes. This is a major requirement in the development of
reliable cell tracking procedures using T(1)-weighted imaging sequences. This
study confirms the potential of SPMnO and USPMnO to establish more quantitative
cell tracking procedures with MRI.

A recently developed methodology, which combines voltammetry, ITC, ESI-MS and
several chemometric tools, has been applied for the first time to the study of
As(III) complexes. The ligands considered, DMSA and DMPS, are commonly used to
treat heavy metal poisoning. The study yields a reliable and consistent picture
of the binding of As(III) by the chelating therapy agents DMSA and DMPS providing
an unambiguous description of the stoichiometries of the complexes (ML(2), with
the occasional appearance of ML in the case of DMSA), both ligands have stability
constants of the same order, with a logβ(2) of 9.2 and 9.8, respectively. These
values confirm the potential efficiency of both ligands in the treatment of
As(III) poisoning.

Antegrade pressure measurement of urinary tract in children with persistent
hydronephrosis.

UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil.

INTRODUCTION: Dilation of urinary tract occurs without the presence of
obstruction. Diagnostic methods that depend on renal function may elicit mistaken
diagnosis. Whitaker (1973) proposed the evaluation of urinary tract pressure
submitted to constant flow. Other investigators proposed perfusion of renal
pelvis under controlled pressure, making the method more physiological and
reproducible. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the results of
the anterograde pressure measurement (APM) of the urinary tract of children with 
persistent hydronephrosis after surgery suspected to present persistent
obstruction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Along 12 years, 26 renal units with persistent
hydronephrosis after surgery (12 PUJ and 14 VUJ) were submitted to evaluation of 
the renal tract pressure in order to decide the form of treatment. Previous
radionuclide scans with DTPA, intravenous pyelographies and ultrasounds were
considered undetermined in relation to obstruction in 10 occasions and
obstructive in 16. APM was performed under radioscopy through renal pelvis
puncture or previous stoma. Saline with methylene blue + iodine contrast was
infused under constant pressure of 40 cm H2O to fill the urinary system. The
ureteral opening pressure was measured following the opening of the system and
stabilization of the water column.
RESULTS: Among the 10 cases with undetermined previous diagnosis, APM was
considered non-obstructive in two and those were treated clinically and eight
were considered obstructive and were submitted to surgery. Among the 16 cases
previously classified as obstructive, nine confirmed obstruction and were
submitted to surgery. Seven cases were considered non-obstructive, and were
treated clinically, with stable DMSA and hydronephrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: APM avoided unnecessary surgery in one third of the cases and was
important to treatment decision in 100 %. We believe that this simple test is an 
excellent diagnostic tool when selectively applied mainly in the presence of
functional deficit.

Comparison of chromatographic methods for quality control of DMSA complexes with 
99mTc and 188Re at (III) and (V) oxidation states.

BACKGROUND: The reliable method for determination of identity and radiochemical
purity (RCP) is of great importance in radiopharmaceutical development. This is
especially relevant when more than one form of radiometal/ligand complex can be
formed during radiolabelling, such as complexes of 99mTc or 188Re with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), where depending on the pH, metal can
occur either at +3 or +5 oxidation state. The aim of our study was to evaluate
possibilities for optimization of chromatographic systems leading to specific and
reliable analytical method for determination of the identity and RCP of DMSA
complexes with 99mTc or 188Re.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The commercial DMSA kits (POLATOM) were used for
preparation of technetium-99m (III) and (V) complexes with DMSA. 99mTc(V)-DMSA
complexes were prepared by addition of NaHCO3 to the kit vial prior to
99mTc-eluate to obtain pH ~8. 188Re(V)-DMSA was prepared either directly or using
intermediate 188Re(III)-EDTA complex added to DMSA. RCP was evaluated by TLC
using: ITLC-SG developed in methylethylketon, SG60 coated plates developed in:
n-BuOH/H2O/CH3COOH and n-PrOH/H2O/CH3COOH systems, and in H2O. Comparative
biodistribution studies were performed in normal Wistar rats.
RESULTS: Using silica gel plates and n-PrOH, H2O and acetic acid in the
developing solution, we observed that 99mTc/188Re(III)-DMSA and
99mTc/188Re(V)-DMSA complexes could be well separated from each other and from
the impurities in the form of free pertechnetate/perrhenate. In vivo studies
showed quite different biodistribution of 99mTc(III)- and 99mTc(V)-DMSA. The
trivalent complex accumulated mainly in kidneys (>40%ID), while 99mTc(V)-DMSA
revealed high excretion with urine and relatively high concentration in osseous
tissue (ca. 2 %ID/g). Accumulation of this complex in kidneys was very low (ca.
2.5 %ID). Biodistribution pattern of 188Re(V)-DMSA prepared directly was almost
identical to that of 99mTc(V)-DMSA. Biodistribution results of the 188Re
preparation obtained using 188Re(III)-EDTA intermediate indicated that the
preparation contained the mixture of penta- and trivalent 188Re complexes. The
quite high accumulation of radioactivity in kidneys (23 %ID) gave evidence of the
presence of 188Re(III)-DMSA in this preparation, what was also confirmed by the
results of TLC analysis performed using silica gel plate and
n-propanol/water/acetic acid as developing system.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study, we have made recommendation on the suitable
methods for investigations of RCP of DMSA complexes, i.e.: SG60 plates developed 
in the mixture of n-propanol/water/acetic acid, which enable determination of the
tri- and pentavalent DMSA complexes, as well as, the pertechnetate/perrhenate
impurity, and developed in water for determination of the colloidal residue.

High-salinity growth conditions promote Tat-independent secretion of Tat
substrates in Bacillus subtilis.

C, van Dijl JM.

Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.

The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis contains two Tat translocases,
which can facilitate transport of folded proteins across the plasma membrane.
Previous research has shown that Tat-dependent protein secretion in B. subtilis
is a highly selective process and that heterologous proteins, such as the green
fluorescent protein (GFP), are poor Tat substrates in this organism.
Nevertheless, when expressed in Escherichia coli, both B. subtilis Tat
translocases facilitated exclusively Tat-dependent export of folded GFP when the 
twin-arginine (RR) signal peptides of the E. coli AmiA, DmsA, or MdoD proteins
were attached. Therefore, the present studies were aimed at determining whether
the same RR signal peptide-GFP precursors would also be exported Tat dependently 
in B. subtilis. In addition, we investigated the secretion of GFP fused to the
full-length YwbN protein, a strict Tat substrate in B. subtilis. Several
investigated GFP fusion proteins were indeed secreted in B. subtilis, but this
secretion was shown to be completely Tat independent. At high-salinity growth
conditions, the Tat-independent secretion of GFP as directed by the RR signal
peptides from the E. coli AmiA, DmsA, or MdoD proteins was significantly
enhanced, and this effect was strongest in strains lacking the TatAy-TatCy
translocase. This implies that high environmental salinity has a negative
influence on the avoidance of Tat-independent secretion of AmiA-GFP, DmsA-GFP,
and MdoD-GFP. We conclude that as-yet-unidentified control mechanisms reject the 
investigated GFP fusion proteins for translocation by the B. subtilis Tat
machinery and, at the same time, set limits to their Tat-independent secretion,
presumably via the Sec pathway.

algorithm, is designed to allow a reduction in image noise, enabling improved
image quality and reduced acquisition time/injected activity. This study aimed to
establish the level of improvement in image quality achievable using this
algorithm. Images were acquired of a phantom simulating a single kidney with a
range of defects of varying sizes, positions and contrasts. These images were
processed using the Pixon processing software and shown to 12 observers (six
experienced and six novices) who were asked to rate the images on a six-point
scale depending on their confidence that a defect was present. The data were
analysed using a receiver operating characteristic approach. Results showed that 
processed images significantly improved the performance of the experienced
observers in terms of their sensitivity and specificity. Although novice
observers showed significant increase in sensitivity when using the software, a
significant decrease in specificity was also seen. This study concludes that the 
Pixon software can be used to improve the assessment of cortical defects in
dimercaptosuccinic acid imaging by suitably trained observers.

University, Nanjing, China.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) coating improves the uptake efficiency presumably 
by engendering the Fe(2)O(3)-NPs. In the present study, we investigated the
possible environmental safety concentrations of Fe(2)O(3)-NPs using different
assay systems in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans with lethality, development,
reproduction, locomotion behavior, pharyngeal pumping, defecation, intestinal
autofluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as the endpoints.
After exposure from L4-larvae for 24-hr, DMSA coated Fe(2)O(3)-NPs at
concentrations more than 50 mg/L exhibited adverse effects on nematodes. After
exposure from L1-larvae to adult, DMSA coated Fe(2)O(3)-NPs at concentrations
more than 500 μg/L had adverse effects on nematodes. After exposure from
L1-larvae to day-8 adult, DMSA coated Fe(2)O(3)-NPs at concentrations more than
100 μg/L resulted in the adverse effects on nematodes. Accompanied with the
alterations of locomotion behaviors, ROS production was pronouncedly induced by
exposure to DMSA coated Fe(2)O(3)-NPs in the examined three assay systems, and
the close associations of ROS production with lethality, growth, reproduction,
locomotion behavior, pharyngeal pumping, defecation, or intestinal
autofluorescence in nematodes exposed to DMSA coated Fe(2)O(3)-NPs were confirmed
by the linear regression analysis. Moreover, mutations of sod-2 and sod-3 genes, 
encoding Mn-SODs, showed more susceptible properties than wild-type when they
were used for assessing the DMSA coated Fe(2)O(3)-NPs-induced toxicity, and the
safety concentrations for DMSA coated Fe(2)O(3)-NPs should be defined as
concentrations lower than 10 μg/L in sod-2 and sod-3 mutant nematodes.

BACKGROUND: Campylobacter jejuni, the most leading cause for bacterial
gastroenteritis worldwide, shows a high genetic diversity among its isolates.
Recently, we demonstrated the existence of six C. jejuni-groups by combining MLST
with six genetic markers. These groups were further characterized by the
detection of cj1321-cj1326, fucP, cj0178, cj0755/cfrA, ceuE, pldA, cstII, and
cstIII in order (I.) to show further associations between these different genetic
markers and MLST CCs. Moreover, different studies were able to associate several 
of these markers: a sialylated lipoologosaccharide (cstII/III(+)), the
gamma-glytamyl-transpeptidase (ggt(+)), and the absence of a certain allele of
the enterochelin-uptake-binding-protein (ceuE(11168)(-)) with severe
campylobacteriosis, bloody diarrhea and unpleasant outcome. Additionally more
than half of human Campylobacter-isolates were assigned to a non-livestock clade 
associated with the absence of cj1321-cj1326. These isolates were considered as
mere colonizers.From the combination of marker genes, the ratio of human isolates
in a specific group, and clinical data (II.) it should be demonstrated to which
of the previous defined groups these Campylobacter-subpopulations, associated
with higher virulence, correspond.
RESULTS: Besides the marker gene pldA, all new estimated genetic markers show
significant differences in their distribution among the various MLST-based
groups. Especially the genes for cj1321-cj1326, fucP, cj0178, cj0755/cfrA are
widely associated with each other and split the study population into two major
and seven intermediate groups substantiating the previous group-definition,
whereas cstII and cstIII indicate at least three groups following an independent 
distribution pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data a group of C. jejuni-isolates characterized by
the presence of ansB, dmsA, ggt, and the absence of cj1365c, cj1585c,
cj1321-cj1326, fucP, cj0178, cj0755/cfrA, and cstII/III was associated with a
higher prevalence in human campylobacteriosis, bloody diarrhea as well as
hospitalization and bears obviously a higher virulence for humans. In contrast to
that better livestock-adapted groups characterized by the ability to utilize
L-fucose and the presence of all of the five identified putative C. jejuni
iron-uptake systems as well as cj1321-cj1326, cj1365c, cj1585c, and cstII and/or 
cstIII (sialylated lipoologosaccharide) is more prevalent in animal hosts and was
secondary associated with less severe campylobacteriosis.

INTRODUCTION: Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MDK) is one of the most common
congenital anomalies of the urinary tract and the main cystic renal disease in
children. Our institution follow-up protocol of MDK uses, as has been performed
more widely in the last two decades, a conservative attitude.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize MDK cases followed in our Outpatient Clinic of
Pediatric Nephrology, evaluate their progress and reflect on the protocol
adopted.
METHODS: 36 MDK patients observed between January 1995 and December 2009 were
included in this retrospective study and followed-up. In 35 children the
diagnosis was the result of prenatal ultrasound. All children underwent a
systematic protocol, including conservative treatment (no surgery) and periodic
clinical, laboratory and ultrasound evaluation. All children underwent a MAG3
renogram or a 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy and a voiding cystourethrography,
only repeated in cases of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
RESULTS: Eighteen children (50%) are male. The median age of first visit was four
weeks. The median of follow-up was 65 months. The MDK was in the left kidney in
20 children (56%). The median age of onset was 10 and six weeks Contralateral
nephro-urologic pathology was identified in 10 cases (28%): seven children with
VUR (grade ≥ IV in three), two with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) and
one with mild pelvic dilatation. There was involution of dysplastic kidney in 27 
cases (75%), partial in 24 and total in three. The involution rate was higher in 
the first 36 months. There was a progressive compensatory hypertrophy of the
contralateral kidney, with the highest rate in the first two years of life. There
was resolution of VUR in five of the seven units reflux (three spontaneous and
two after ureteral reimplantation). The two children with UPJO underwent surgery.
There was no malignant degeneration and there was not carry out any nephrectomy
of dysplastic kidney. Urinary infection occurred in nine children (25%), three of
which have VUR and two with UPJO. There were no cases of hypertension or
decreased glomerular filtration rate.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are generally consistent with other
casuistics and confirm the fairness of a conservative attitude in the approach of
children with MDK. This clinical approach is safe, with a minimum incidence of
complications, with tendency to involution of dysplasic kidney being the rule.

Late evaluation of the relationship between morphological and functional renal
changes and hypertension after non-operative treatment of high-grade renal
injuries.

University of São Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil. gersonapj@gmail.com.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anatomical and functional renal alterations and the
association with post-traumatic arterial hypertension.
METHODS: The studied population included patients who sustained high grades renal
injury (grades III to V) successfully non-operative management after staging by
computed tomography over a 16-year period. Beyond the review of medical records, 
these patients were invited to the following protocol: clinical and laboratory
evaluation, abdominal computed tomography, magnetic resonance angiography, DMSA
renal scintigraphy, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The hypertensive
patients also were submitted to dynamic renal scintigraphy (99mTc EC), using
captopril stimulation to verify renal vascular etiology.
RESULTS: Of the 31 patients, there were thirteen grade III, sixteen grade IV
(nine lacerations, and seven vascular lesions), and two grade V injuries. All the
patients were asymptomatic and an average follow up post-injury of 6.4 years.
None had abnormal BUN or seric creatinine. The percentage of renal volume
reduction correlates with the severity as defined by OIS. There was no evidence
of renal artery stenosis in Magnetic Resonance angiography (MRA). DMSA scanning
demonstrated a decline in percentage of total renal function corresponding to
injury severity (42.2 ± 5.5% for grade III, 35.3 ± 12.8% for grade IV,
13.5 ± 19.1 for grade V). Six patients (19.4%) had severe compromised function (<
30%). There was statistically significant difference in the decrease in renal
function between parenchymal and vascular causes for grade IV injuries
(p < 0.001). The 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring detected nine
patients (29%) with post-traumatic hypertension. All the patients were male, mean
35.6 years, 77.8 % had a familial history of arterial hypertension, 66.7% had
grade III renal injury, and average post-injury time was 7.8 years. Seven
patients had negative captopril renography.
CONCLUSIONS: Late results of renal function after conservative treatment of high 
grades renal injuries are favorable, except for patients with grades IV with
vascular injuries and grade V renal injuries. Moreover, arterial hypertension
does not correlate with the grade of renal injury or reduction of renal function.

Hyponatremia may reflect severe inflammation in children with febrile urinary
tract infection.

Park SJ(1), Oh YS, Choi MJ, Shin JI, Kim KH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Ajou University Hospital, Ajou University School of 
Medicine, Suwon, Korea.

BACKGROUND: Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in clinical
practice, but little is known about the association between febrile urinary tract
infection (UTI) and hyponatremia or its significance to clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Data from 140 children with febrile UTI between 2000 and 2010 were
retrospectively analyzed. Laboratory examinations [white blood cell (WBC) count, 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum sodium 
concentration], renal ultrasonography, (99m)Technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scintigraphy, and voiding cystourethrogram were performed. Culture growing
>50,000 colonies of one single bacterial species on a urine sample obtained by
catheter or >100,000 colonies on two clean-catch samples was required to
establish diagnosis of UTI.
RESULTS: In children with renal cortical defects diagnosed after DMSA
scintigraphy (group 1), duration of fever was significantly longer (P = 0.038)
and WBC (P = 0.047) and CRP (P < 0.0001) levels significantly higher than in
those without renal cortical defects (group 2). However, serum sodium levels were
significantly lower in group 1 than group 2 (135.9 ± 2.4 vs 137.4 ± 2.7 mEq/L, P 
= 0.007). Hyponatremia (serum sodium ≤ 135 mEq/L) was also more frequent in group
1 than in group 2 (74.1 % vs 45.3 %, P = 0.012). Serum sodium concentration was
negatively correlated with WBC count (r = -0.156, P = 0.011) and CRP levels (r = 
-0.160, P= 0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that hyponatremia may be a substantial
inflammatory marker and is significantly and independently associated with the
degree of inflammation in children with febrile UTI.

The development of a theranostic nanoplatform based on rotavirus structural
protein VP4-coated Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles (NPs) for dual modality magnetic
resonance/fluorescence cellular imaging and drug delivery is reported. VP4
protein was obtained from Escherichia coli approach, and then chemically
conjugated to Fe(3)O(4) NPs premodified with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinnic acid
(DMSA) in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC).
Next, the VP4-coated Fe(3)O(4) NPs were loaded with doxorubicin (DOX), a typical 
anticancer drug, via formation of amide bond through the EDC approach. Prussian
blue staining analysis reveals that the VP4-coated Fe(3)O(4) NPs can be
internalized efficiently by MA104 and HepG2 cells, thereby significantly
improving cellular MRI sensitivity, compared with dextran- and BSA-coated
Fe(3)O(4) NPs. In addition, DOX loaded on the VP4-coated Fe(3)O(4) NPs exhibits
significant cytotoxicity to the cancer cells (HepG2). The current work provides a
general approach toward the rational design and synthesis of a versatile
theranostic nanoplatform based on functional protein-coated magnetic NPs with
good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and capability of simultaneously
performing multimodality imaging and therapy for optimal clinical outcomes.

In vitro assessment of chelating agents with regard to their abstraction
efficiency of Cd(2+) bound to plasma proteins.

Zeini Jahromi E(1), Gailer J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.

The exposure of various human populations to Cd(2+) is of increasing health
concern. After its gastrointestinal absorption into the bloodstream, Cd(2+) binds
to α(2)-macroglobulin and serum albumin. Although animal studies have
demonstrated that meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and diethylenetriamine 
pentaacetic acid (DTPA) can effectively mobilize Cd(2+) to urine and decrease the
Cd concentrations of the kidneys, the liver and the brain, not much is known
about the abstraction of Cd(2+) from blood plasma proteins. We prepared a stock
of Cd(2+) spiked rabbit plasma (2.0 μg of Cd(2+)/mL) and analyzed aliquots by
size exclusion chromatography coupled on-line to an inductively coupled plasma
atomic emission spectrometer (SEC-ICP-AES) while simultaneously monitoring the
emission lines of Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, and Zn. After the addition of 0.33 mM, 0.66 mM 
or 0.99 mM of DMSA, DTPA, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) or
N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) to plasma aliquots, the obtained mixtures were analyzed
by SEC-ICP-AES after 5 min and 30 min. None of the investigated compounds
adversely affected the plasma distribution of Fe at all investigated doses. At
0.33 mM, DTPA was most effective at mobilizing plasma protein bound Cd(2+) to a
~5 kDa Cd-species (100% removal), followed by DMPS (94%), DMSA (83%) and NAC
(3%). All investigated compounds also mobilized Zn(2+) from plasma proteins to ~5
kDa Zn-species (DTPA: 80% removal; DMPS: 63%; DMSA: 29% and NAC: 3%). The
addition of DTPA resulted in the dose-dependent elution of a [Ca-DTPA](3-)
complex. Based on these results, 0.33 mM DMSA represents the best compromise that
can be achieved between maximizing the abstraction of Cd(2+) from plasma proteins
(83%), while minimizing the mobilization of Zn(2+) from plasma proteins (29%),
and avoiding the complexation of Ca(2+).

[Uretero-intestinal anastomosis: Achilles heel of urinary diversion using bowel
segments].

A well-functioning uretero-intestinal anastomosis is essential for the
preservation of kidney function following urinary diversion using bowel segments.
In incontinent forms of urinary diversions, such as ileal conduits, the ureters
are usually implanted in a refluxive manner, whereas there is still controversy
about the ideal implantation technique in continent orthotopic or heterotopic
reservoirs (i.e. refluxive versus anti-refluxive). Current techniques of
refluxive and antirefluxive uretero-intestinal anastomosis, their indications,
typical perioperative and postoperative complications and management are
discussed. Irradiated or preoperatively dilated ureters show a higher
complication rate in terms of postoperative dilatation and obstruction. Early
revision of the implantation site and ureteral reimplantation yield more
favorable outcomes and long-term results than a minor invasive endourological
treatment. As ureteral stenosis may occur more than 15 years after urinary
diversion, regular follow-up including sonographic evaluation of the upper
urinary tract to detect hydronephrosis is mandatory. In this setting a diuretic
renogram with MAG-III is a helpful tool to determine split renal function and to 
discriminate urodynamic relevant dilatation of the upper urinary tract from
clinical situations requiring only observation, while dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scans provide valuable information about renal scarring.

Formation of Ag nanoframes with facilitation of dithiols.

Cheng FY(1), Hu KW, Yeh CS.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Oral Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701,
Taiwan.

Two-dimensional Ag nanoprisms readily formed Ag triangular nanoframes upon
electron beam irradiation. Following meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinicacid (DMSA)
ripening behavior, continuous electron beam exposure transformed a solid
nanoplate into a core/void/shell morphology, which then evolved into a hollow
nanoframe structure. TEM was used to observe the ripening and etching processes
of Ag nanoprisms as a function of DMSA concentration and electron irradiation
time. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and FT-IR analysis were conducted to characterize
the Ag nanoprism structure and surface before and after treatment with DMSA.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine surface chemical
compositions and indicated DMSA was adsorbed on the Ag nanoprisms in the form of 
Ag(+)-S(-). Raman measurements provided evidence of a disulfide group on Ag
nanoprisms. Similar organosulfur structures such as mercaptosuccinic acid and
2-mercaptoacetic acid were also studied with results suggesting that the two S-H 
groups of dithiol DMSA played the crucial role in nanoframe fabrication. Using
the same strategy with DMSA, the nano-architecture can be extended to 2D
nanodiscs yielding nanorings.

BACKGROUND: Children with renovascular hypertension often present with severe
hypertension. Some children have severe obstruction of their renal arteries
resulting in <10% relative function on [(99m)Tc]dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scan. Conventional treatment of these children has been nephrectomy of the poorly
functioning kidney to normalise their blood pressure (BP).
CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: We describe three children aged 20 months to 9 years
with severe renal artery stenosis and severe hypertension who had radionucleotide
uptake of 0% in one kidney. In one case, no renal perfusion was demonstrated by
duplex ultrasound scan. Significant recovery of relative renal function of 18 to 
52% was achieved after revascularisation by percutaneous angioplasty or open
surgery of the obstructed renal artery.
CONCLUSION: These cases illustrate that scintigraphy alone cannot be used to
predict salvageable function in children with renovascular disease.

The incidence of urinary tract infection after open anti-reflux surgery for
primary vesicoureteral reflux: early and long-term follow up.

Yeoh JS(1), Greenfield SP, Adal AY, Williot P.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Urology, Women & Children's Hospital of Buffalo,
Buffalo, NY 14222, USA.

OBJECTIVES: Controversy exists regarding the benefit of open anti-reflux surgery 
(OS) in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI). We, therefore,
reviewed our short and long term data in children who have undergone OS.
METHODS: 153 children (131F, 22M; ages 2-16 yrs, mean 8 yrs) underwent OS from
1990 to 2008. Reasons for presentation were UTI-131; sibling survey-19; prenatal 
hydronephrosis-3. Major reasons for OS were: breakthrough UTI-74 (48%), high
grade (IV or V)-49 (32%), poor compliance with prophylaxis-15 (10%). Of 153
pre-operative DMSA scans, 60 (39%) had defects. Post-operative studies were
performed 6 months after surgery and 151 (99%) had negative voiding
cystourethrograms (VCUG's). All underwent urine cultures 6 months post-op and
prophylaxis was stopped. 56 (37%) were later contacted at an average 7 yrs
post-op (range: 2-13 yrs).
RESULTS: 23 (15% of 153 followed short term, 40% of 56 followed long term)-20F,
3M-had non-febrile UTI's (nfUTI's) and one girl (0.6%) had a febrile UTI (fUTI). 
Of those who had nfUTI's 7 (30%) had high grade reflux and 16 (70%) had pre-op
breakthrough UTI's. 11 (48%) had DMSA scans with defects. 2 had UTI's within 1
year after a negative VCUG and 21 had UTI's later (1-8 yrs). 1 girl had a fUTI 1 
month after a negative VCUG.
CONCLUSIONS: Successful OS effectively eliminates fUTI. Families should be
counseled that nfUTI may occur many years after surgery, especially in girls with
a history of breakthrough UTI and renal scarring.

Within the body of this review, we provide updates on the mechanisms involved in 
the renal handling mercury (Hg) and the vicinal dithiol complexing/chelating
agents, 2,3-bis(sulfanyl)propane-1-sulfonate (known formerly as
2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate, DMPS) and meso-2,3-bis(sulfanyl)succinate
(known formerly as meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate, DMSA), with a focus on the
therapeutic effects of these dithiols following exposure to different chemical
forms of Hg. We begin by reviewing briefly some of the chemical properties of Hg,
with an emphasis on the high bonding affinity between mercuric ions and reduced
sulfur atoms, principally those contained in protein and nonprotein thiols. A
discussion is provided on the current body of knowledge pertaining to the
handling of various mercuric species within the kidneys, focusing on the primary 
cellular targets that take up and are affected adversely by these species of Hg, 
namely, proximal tubular epithelial cells. Subsequently, we provide a brief
update on the current knowledge on the handling of DMPS and DMSA in the kidneys. 
In particular, parallels are drawn between the mechanisms participating in the
uptake of various thiol S-conjugates of Hg in proximal tubular cells and
mechanisms by which DMPS and DMSA gain entry into these target epithelial cells. 
Finally, we discuss factors that permit DMPS and DMSA to bind intracellular
mercuric ions and mechanisms transporting DMPS and DMSA S-conjugates of Hg out of
proximal tubular epithelial cells into the luminal compartment of the nephron,
and promoting urinary excretion.

The skeleton is one of the most common organs affected by metastatic cancer, and 
bone metastases often cause severe pain, which significantly affects quality of
life. Internal radiotherapy using specifically localized bone-seeking
radiopharmaceuticals has proven to be an effective alternative and shows fewer
side effects than those associated with other forms of treatment. In this review 
article, we highlight not only radiopharmaceuticals, which have been approved for
the palliation of bone metastases but also boneseeking radiolabeled compounds
under investigation in basic research. Specifically, we review the efficacy and
prospects of phosphorus- 32, strontium-89 chloride, samarium-153-EDTMP,
rhenium-186/188-HEDP, rhenium-186/188-complex conjugated bisphosphonate
compounds, yttrium-90-DOTA conjugated bisphosphonate, rhenium-186/188-DMSA,
radium-223 chloride, thorium-227-EDTMP, thorium-227-DOTMP, and
lead/bismuth-212-DOTMP.

(99m)Tc-DMSA (V) in Evaluation of Osteosarcoma: Comparative Studies with
(18)F-FDG PET/CT in Detection of Primary and Malignant Lesions.

To evaluate the role of (99m)Tc-DMSA (V) and [(18)F]FDG PET-CT in management of
patients with osteosarcoma, 22 patients were included in our study. All patients 
underwent both (99m)Tc-DMSA (V) and whole-body [(18)F]FDG PET-CT scans within an 
interval of 1 week. 555-740 MBq of (99m)Tc-DMSA (V) was injected i.v. the
whole-body planar, SPECT images of primary site and chest were performed after
3-4 hours. [(18)F]FDG PET-CT images were obtained 60 minutes after i.v. injection
of 370 MBq of F-18 FDG. Both FDG PET-CT (mean SUV(max) = 7.1) and DMSA (V) scans 
showed abnormal uptake at primary site in all the 22 patients (100% sensitivity
for both). Whole-body PET-CT detected metastasis in 11 pts (lung mets in 10 and
lung + bone mets in 1 patient). Whole-body planar DMSA (V) and SPECT detected
bone metastasis in one patient, lung mets in 7 patients and LN in 1 patient. HRCT
of chest confirmed lung mets in 10 patients and inflammatory lesion in one
patient. 7 patients positive for mets on DMSA (V) scan had higher uptake in lung 
lesions as compared to FDG uptake on PET-CT. Three patients who did not show any 
DMSA uptake had subcentimeter lung nodule. Resuts of both (99m)Tc-DMSA (V)
(whole-body planar and SPECT imaging) and [(18)F]FDG PET-CT were comparable in
evaluation of primary site lesions and metastatic lesions greater than 1 cm.
Though (99m)Tc-DMSA (V) had higher uptake in the lesions as compared to
[(18)F]FDG PET-CT, the only advantage [(18)F]FDG PET-CT had was that it could
also detect subcentimeter lesions.

INTRODUCTION: Preparation of clinical-scale (99)Mo/(99m)Tc generator using (n,γ) 
activated low specific activity (99)Mo and nanocrystalline γ-Al(2)O(3) as a high 
capacity sorbent matrix is attempted.
METHODS: Nanocrystalline γ-Al(2)O(3) was synthesized by 'solid state
mechanochemical' reaction of aluminum nitrate with ammonium bicarbonate.
Experimental parameters were optimized to effectively separate (99m)Tc from
(99)Mo using this sorbent as the column matrix. The performance features of a 13 
GBq (350 mCi) (99)Mo/(99m)Tc generator using this sorbent and (99)Mo produced by 
(n,γ) route having specific activity 12.9-18.5 GBq/g were evaluated for 10 days.
RESULTS: The sorbent possessed the requisite selectivity for (99)Mo and
demonstrated a maximum sorption capacity of 200 ± 5mg Mo/g, which is ~10 times
higher than that of ordinary acidic alumina. The overall yield of (99m)Tc was
>80%, with radionuclidic purity >99.99% and radiochemical purity >99%. The yield 
of (99m)Tc varied from 7.8 to 2.1 GBq in the eluate for the six days of operation
of the generator. The radioactive concentration of (99m)Tc eluted was adequate
for the formulation of radiopharmaceuticals. The performance of the generator
remained consistent over an extended period of 10 days. The eluted (99m)Tc was
suitable for the formulation of (99m)Tc-DMSA and (99m)Tc-EC resulting in high
radiolabeling yields (>98%).
CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of γ-Al(2)O(3) as a new generation sorbent in the
development of clinically useful (99)Mo/(99m)Tc generator using low specific
activity (99)Mo and yielding (99m)Tc with adequate radioactive concentration and 
high purity suitable for formulation of radiopharmaceuticals is demonstrated.

V5A 1S6.

We present a method for the purification of the 45 residue long leader peptide of
Escherichia coli dimethyl sulfoxide reductase subunit A (DmsA(L)), a substrate of
the twin arginine translocase, by co-expressing the leader peptide with its
specific chaperone protein, DmsD. The peptide can be isolated from the soluble
DmsA(L)/DmsD complex or conveniently from the lysate pellet fraction. The
recombinant leader peptide is functionally intact as the peptide/chaperone
complex can be reconstituted from purified DmsA(L) and DmsD. A construct with
DmsA(L) fused to the N-terminus of DmsD (DmsA(L)-DmsD fusion) was created to
further explore the properties of the leader peptide-chaperone interactions.
Analytical size-exclusion chromatography in-line with multi-angle light
scattering reveals that the DmsA(L)-DmsD fusion construct forms a dimer wherein
each protomer binds the neighboring leader peptide. A model of this homodimeric
interaction is presented.

This study was undertaken to determine the predisposing factors for renal
scarring in children with urinary tract infection. In this prospective cohort
study, 176 children with documented urinary tract infection were categorized into
four groups: ≤1 year old, 1-2 years old, 2-7 years and 7-14 years old.
Ultrasonography and Technetium-99 m-DMSA scan were used to detect the possible
abnormalities. Infants under 12 months old presented as the most common group for
renal scarring (27 cases, 52.9%), and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was diagnosed
in 29 cases (56.8%). Fifteen (41.67%) children between the ages of one and two
years had renal scar, and VUR was detected in half of the patients. In the third 
group, 36.3%, and in fourth group, 41.6% of the patients had renal scar. Also,
38.6% in group three and 50% in the final group had VUR. A co-incidental finding 
that was observed in this study was the high incidence of pseudohypoaldesteronism
(PHA) in our patients: in 39.2% of the children in group one, 22.2% in group two 
and 4% in group three. In group four however, none of the patients had PHA. Risk 
of scar formation with urinary tract infection (UTI) was higher in the younger
age group and in those with recurrent UTIs.

A 14-year-old boy presented with asymptomatic right hydronephrosis detected on
routine yearly ultrasound examination. Previously, he had at least two normal
renal ultrasonograms, 4 years after remission of acute myeloblastic leukemia,
treated by AML-BFM-93 protocol. A function of the right kidney and no damage on
the left was confirmed by a DMSA scan. Right retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy
revealed 3 renal arteries with the lower pole artery lying on the pelviureteric
junction. Histologically chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis was detected. In
the pathogenesis of this severe unilateral renal damage, we suspect the
exacerbation of deleterious effects of cytostatic therapy on kidneys with
intermittent hydronephrosis.

OBJECTIVES: Review the clinical and radiological characteristics of the different
kinds of urinary tract duplications, assessing the outcome of the cases and the
incidence of renal parenchymal injury.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed including 301 children 
diagnosed of renal duplication by urological ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram
(VCUG) and 99-technetium renal scintigraphy (DMSA).
RESULTS: They were classified in four groups. The first consisted of 166 (55.1%) 
cases that had complete ureteral duplication without an obstructive component
(CD). The cases that had an upper system obstruction due to an ectopic ureter
(EU), 19 (6.3%), or an ureterocele (UTC), 35 (11.6%), were divided into two
different groups. The fourth group 81 (26.9%) had incomplete ureteral
duplication. The nephro-urological study was performed in 181/301 after a urinary
tract infection; in 100/301 after a prenatal finding of hydronephrosis. It was a 
casual diagnosis in 20/301. The percentage upper kidney dilation in the
diagnostic ultrasound was significantly higher in those with EU 16/19 (84%) and
in those with UTC 33/35 (94%), compared with the upper pole dilations found in
the CD 35/166 (21%) and ID 21/81 (25%). Surgery was performed in 96/166 (41%) of 
the CD, 7/81 of the ID, 16/19 (84%) of the EU, and 34/35 (97%) of the UTC. Three 
cases with EU and 8 with UTC needed a second surgery, and 3 a third one. No
scintigraphy changes were observed in 58% of the patients in the CD group, 87% in
the ID group, 29% in the EU group, and 5% in the UTC group. As regards the renal 
duplications who did not have surgery, it was found that there were 98 refluxing 
units in the CD, and 74 in the ID. The spontaneous resolution of the
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was 80% in the CD, and 90% in the ID (McNemar test
P<.001). The average healing time ranged from 1 year to 5 years (Mean: 3 years
and 3 months).
CONCLUSION: The patients with higher risk of having renal injury are those who
presented with a duplication with upper kidney obstruction due to ectopic
insertion of the ureter, particularly due to an ureterocele.

OBJECTIVE: To determine possible acute kidney injury with new marker neutrophil
gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in urine and to show the relationship
between changes of this marker and conventional markers in patients undergoing
shock wave lithotripsy (SWL).
METHODS: In patients with kidney stones, serum urea, creatinine, urine
microalbumin, and NGAL levels were determined before SWL and at the first,
second, and seventh days after SWL. In addition, patients who had undergone SWL
were evaluated with Technetium-99m (Tc99m)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and
Tc99m-diethylenetriaminepenta acetate renal scintigraphy 1 week before and 3
months after SWL.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Forty patients were included in the study. All patients 
had a single stone in the kidney with an average size of 9.25 mm (range 5-15). No
statistical change was found in the levels of average serum urea and creatinine
levels, urine microglobulin, and NGAL levels, which were measured before SWL and 
after SWL. No significant difference was identified in urine NGAL and
microalbumin levels of the groups, which were separated by shock wave number and 
shock energy amount on the first, second, and seventh days after SWL. In the
high-energy SWL group, 3 patients had a statistical decrease in their
differential kidney function measured with Tc99m difference between differential 
function rates of the kidney before and after SWL (DMSA) after 3 months after
SWL.
CONCLUSION: Our study found that, using both new and conventional parameters in
the acute stage and 3 months later, SWL treatment does not cause acute kidney
damage.

The hydrophobic core of twin-arginine signal sequences orchestrates specific
binding to Tat-pathway related chaperones.

Redox enzyme maturation proteins (REMPs) bind pre-proteins destined for
translocation across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane via the twin-arginine
translocation system and enable the enzymatic incorporation of complex cofactors.
Most REMPs recognize one specific pre-protein. The recognition site usually
resides in the N-terminal signal sequence. REMP binding protects signal peptides 
against degradation by proteases. REMPs are also believed to prevent binding of
immature pre-proteins to the translocon. The main aim of this work was to better 
understand the interaction between REMPs and substrate signal sequences. Two
REMPs were investigated: DmsD (specific for dimethylsulfoxide reductase, DmsA)
and TorD (specific for trimethylamine N-oxide reductase, TorA). Green fluorescent
protein (GFP) was genetically fused behind the signal sequences of TorA and DmsA.
This ensures native behavior of the respective signal sequence and excludes any
effects mediated by the mature domain of the pre-protein. Surface plasmon
resonance analysis revealed that these chimeric pre-proteins specifically bind to
the cognate REMP. Furthermore, the region of the signal sequence that is
responsible for specific binding to the corresponding REMP was identified by
creating region-swapped chimeric signal sequences, containing parts of both the
TorA and DmsA signal sequences. Surprisingly, specificity is not encoded in the
highly variable positively charged N-terminal region of the signal sequence, but 
in the more similar hydrophobic C-terminal parts. Interestingly, binding of DmsD 
to its model substrate reduced membrane binding of the pre-protein. This property
could link REMP-signal peptide binding to its reported proofreading function.

We report here a detailed structural and magnetic study of different silica
nanocapsules containing uniform and highly crystalline maghemite nanoparticles.
The magnetic phase consists of 5 nm triethylene glycol (TREG)- or
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)-coated maghemite particles. TREG-coated
nanoparticles were synthesized by thermal decomposition. In a second step, TREG
ligands were exchanged by DMSA. After the ligand exchange, the ζ potential of the
particles changed from -10 to -40 mV, whereas the hydrodynamic size remained
constant at around 15 nm. Particles coated by TREG and DMSA were encapsulated in 
silica following a sol-gel procedure. The encapsulation of TREG-coated
nanoparticles led to large magnetic aggregates, which were embedded in coalesced 
silica structures. However, DMSA-coated nanoparticles led to small magnetic
clusters inserted in silica spheres of around 100 nm. The final nanostructures
can be described as the result of several competing factors at play. Magnetic
measurements indicate that in the TREG-coated nanoparticles the interparticle
magnetic interaction scenario has not dramatically changed after the silica
encapsulation, whereas in the DMSA-coated nanoparticles, the magnetic
interactions were screened due to the function of the silica template. Moreover, 
the analysis of the AC susceptibility suggests that our systems essentially
behave as cluster spin glass systems.

Stenosis of the ureteroenterostomy and symptomatic reflux are among the most
dangerous complications of all forms of urinary diversion. Variations in ureter
implantation techniques and different surgical expertises are responsible for the
heterogeneity of the available prevalence data. Antirefluxive implantation
techniques seem to be more vulnerable to stenosis and obstruction than refluxive 
techniques, although no difference in kidney function deterioration over time was
shown according to the presence or absence of reflux protection. Despite frequent
controls, approximately one quarter of all obstructed renal units show a complete
loss of function. The reimplantation rate of stenotic ureters exceeds 30%.The
development of an implantation stenosis may be silent and subtle. The loss of
renal function often remains unnoticed if sonography and creatinine measurements 
are the only follow-up tools employed. Neither of these tests is reliable in
estimating kidney function and may mislead both doctor and patient. DMSA
scintigraphy and retrograde contrast studies (conduitogram, pouchogram) are the
most sensitive tools available to evaluate a symptomatic reflux, whereas MAG-3
renal scans and antegrade function tests (nephrostogram, renal pelvic pressure
measurement) are recommended for investigating ureteric obstruction. Stenosis of 
the ureteroenterostomy usually occurs within 2 years after urinary diversion;
delayed occurrence of ureteric obstruction is indicative of malignant local
recurrence or compressive metastases.There are various minimally invasive
treatment options such as balloon dilatation, internal ureterotomy, stenting and 
nephrostomy placement. However, the technical challenge of a ureteroenterostomy
should not be a deterrent. In fact, if surgically possible, the patient should be
offered open revision, since this is the only way to durably cure the underlying 
pathology and re-establish the already impaired quality of life of patients with 
urinary diversion as much as possible.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to automate volume measurement of
pediatric kidneys using Technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc DMSA)
SPECT. Assessment of renal size is essential in making an accurate clinical
diagnosis and in evaluating normal and abnormal renal growth. Existing techniques
for measuring renal length and volume are often observer-dependent and are
limited by interobserver variability.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An automated method using 99mTc DMSA SPECT was developed
to measure renal length, volume, and 2D/3D split renal functions. An adaptive
threshold was used for segmentation of renal images. To improve measurement
accuracy of renal volumes, a boundary-weighted integration and a linear
correction from phantom experiments were applied. Using the new automated
software, we evaluated 620 normal kidneys in 310 patients aged 1 to 21 years.
RESULTS: In all, 99.4% of renal volume measurement was inter-/intraobserver
reproducible without manual intervention. Correlations between renal size (volume
and length) and growth parameters (age and body weight) were evaluated by
nonlinear regression modeling. Body weight was found to be the best predictor of 
kidney volume and length (P < 0.0001). Normal ranges were established according
to body weight.
CONCLUSIONS: Automatic renal volume measurement with 99mTc DMSA SPECT
demonstrates high observer reproducibility, and it is useful for achieving
accurate assessment of renal growth using sequential measurements. The renal
growth models generated by this study will aid physicians in evaluating and
monitoring renal growth.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the potentials of technitium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine
(99mTc MAG3) to replace technitium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc DMSA) in
assessment of renal cortex and split renal function (SRF).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This a retrospective study in which we reviewed the
scintigraphic results of 52 patients with age range of 7 days-10 years (mean, 5.3
years). A total of 104 studies (1 99mTc MAG3 and 1 99mTc DMSA per patient) were
performed between 1 January, 2009 and 31 December, 2010 because of various renal 
disorders. Both studies were performed within 24 hours of each other, starting
with 99mTc MAG3.
RESULTS: Twenty patients had normal SRF, and 26 patients had abnormal SRF (6 with
solitary kidney, 4 with 1 kidney SRF <10%, and 16 with 1 kidney SRF >10%). In all
46 patients, SRF assessed by 99mTc MAG3 correlated with that by 99mTc DMSA (P =
0.0001). In remaining 6 patients, the correlation was less optimal, and the
diseased kidney had overestimation of SRF by 99mTc MAG3. Nonvisualized kidneys
and cortical defects were observed equally on both studies.
CONCLUSION: 99mTc MAG3 provides adequate images for assessment of renal cortex
and accurate measurement of SRF comparable with 99mTc DMSA results. In addition, 
it provides important information on the urodynamics of both kidneys, avoids
unnecessary radiation to the children, as well as is time saving. We consider it 
is time to replace the 99mTc DMSA with 99mTc MAG3 in most nephrourologic
disorders in pediatric patients and to keep the former to doubtful cases obtained
using the latter.

PURPOSE: To evaluate modulation transfer function (MTF) in single photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT) systems using the line spread function (LSF) method
and a novel flood source which can be easily fabricated with materials accessible
in hospital facilities.
METHODS: A Tc-99m-based flood source (E(γ) = 140 keV) consisting of a
radiopharmaceutical bound to the grains of a radiographic film was prepared in
laboratory. Various films and radiopharmaceuticals were examined, in order to
obtain a thin homogenous and reproducible flood source. The source showing best
uniformity and reproducibility was placed between two PMMA blocks and images were
obtained by using the brain tomographic acquisition protocol (brain) and the
myocardial perfusion tomographic acquisition protocol (heart). MTF was evaluated 
by determining the LSF for various reconstruction methods and filters. MTF
calculation was obtained by the utilization of a custom made software in which a 
method similar to the one proposed by Boone [Med. Phys. 28, 356-360 (2001)] was
implemented. All imaging experiments were performed in a Siemens e-Cam γ-camera. 
Furthermore, MTF was assessed through the point spread function (PSF) following
conventional methods.
RESULTS: The optimum homogeneity was obtained by immersing an Agfa MammoRay HDR
Medical x-ray film in a solution of dithiothreitol (DTT, 10(-3)
M)/Tc-99m(III)-DMSA (DMSA: trivalent technetium-99m-dimercapto-succinic acid, 40 
mCi/40 ml) for 30 min in the dark. These films exhibited better uniformity
(CV < 1.9%). Higher MTF values were obtained for the brain scan protocol with
iterative 3D with eight iterations reconstruction method. MTF of the brain
protocol was in all cases better than the heart protocol. MTFs derived from LSF
were more precise compared with those obtained from PSF since their
reproducibility was better in all cases, providing a mean standard deviation of
0.0065, in contrary to the PSF method which gave 0.0348.
CONCLUSIONS: The method presented here is novel and easy to implement, requiring 
materials commonly found in clinical practice. Furthermore, this technique which 
is based on the LSF method reduces measurement noise levels due to the larger
amount of data averaging than in the conventional PSF method. Furthermore, MTF
can be assessed easily, in three dimensions (3D), by placing the flood source
either in sagittal or coronal direction.

AIMS: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) contributes to renal fibrogenesis in several manners
such as increasing collagen synthesis in mesangium, decreasing extracellular
matrix (ECM) degradation by mesangial cells and stimulating mesangial
contraction. The aim of our study was to investigate whether urine level of ET-1 
(uET-1) could represent a useful biomarker of renal scarring and if so, to
determine the optimal cutoff level for uET-1 to predict a renal scar.
METHODS: 44 children with renal scarring and 32 children without renal scarring
were enrolled in the study. Urine ET-1 was measured by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Mean uET-1 level was significantly higher in the scar group than in
controls (2.75 ± 1.35 fmol/ml vs. 0.68 ± 0.41 fmol/ml, p = 0.001). The optimal
cut-off level was 1.064 fmol/ml for uET-1 to predict renal scarring. Using this
cut-off point, sensitivity and specificity were 97.73% and 93.91%, respectively. 
AUC was found 0.975 (95% CI 0.917 - 0.996) for uET-1. Mean urine
Endothelin-1/Creatinine ratio (uET-1/Cr) was also significantly higher in the
scar group than in the control group (4.04 ± 2.29 fmol/mg Cr vs. 1.09 ± 0.67
fmol/mg Cr, p = 0.0001). Using 1.67 fmol/mgCr as optimal cut-off level,
sensitivity and specificity were 95.45% and 84.09%, respectively. AUC was 0.945
(95% CI 0.875 - 0.982) for uET-1/Cr.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that both uET-1 and uET-1/Cr can be used for
prediction of renal scarring in children with normal renal function. Measuring
urine level of ET-1 can help us to avoid unnecessary DMSA studies if the
patient's uET-1 level is found to be under the determined cut-off point.

Screening high-grade vesicoureteral reflux in young infants with a febrile
urinary tract infection.

Chungshan North Road, Taipei, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: The lack of good evidence for improved outcomes in children and young
infants with febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) after aggressive treatment for
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has raised doubts regarding the need for routine
voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), and the appropriate imaging evaluation in
these children remains controversial.
OBJECTIVES: This prospective study aimed to determine whether abnormalities found
on acute dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and ultrasound (US) can help
indicate the necessity of voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in young infants.
METHODS: For 3.5 years, all infants younger than 3 months presenting with first
febrile UTI were prospectively studied. All infants were hospitalized and
investigated using US (<3 days after admission), DMSA scan (<5 days after
admission), and VCUG (7-10 days after antibiotic treatment) after diagnosis. The 
association among findings of US, DMSA scan, and VCUG were evaluated.
RESULTS: From 220 infants, there were abnormal results in 136 (61.8%) US and in
111 (50.5%) DMSA scans. By US, ten infants (4.5%) with abscess or structural
abnormalities other than VUR were diagnosed. High-grade (III-V) VUR was present
in 39 patients (17.7%). The sensitivities for high-grade VUR of renal US alone
(76.9%) or DMSA scan alone (82.1%) were not as good as that of the "OR rule"
strategy, which had 92.3% sensitivity and 94.3% negative predictive value.
CONCLUSIONS: To screen high-grade VUR in young infants with febrile UTI, US and
acute DMSA scan could be performed first. VCUG is only indicated when
abnormalities are apparent on either US or DMSA scan or both.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the association between
previously documented risk factors such as recurrent pyelonephritis with the
incidence of renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis in children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children with acute pyelonephritis who were admitted to the
Department of Pediatrics of a teaching hospital during 2007-2009 were enrolled in
this study. DMSA scans were obtained 4-6 months after the last episode of
pyelonephritis in all patients.
RESULTS: A total of 80 children with acute pyelonephritis were enrolled in this
study. Most of them were girls (77.5%), with a median age of 12 months. Nearly
half of the children (n = 44; 55%) had one or more renal scars. The distribution 
of gender, CRP level and leukocytosis did not differ significantly regarding the 
absence or presence of renal scars (p > 0.05). Most of the scars occurred in
children who had presented with bilateral pyelonephritis (69.4% vs. 18.2%, p =
0.001). Most of the patients with renal scars had a positive history of
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (75% vs.13.6%, p = 0.001). The significant roles of
recurrent pyelonephritis and presence of VUR were further confirmed by
multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: According to our findings, presence of VUR and recurrent
pyelonephritis are independently associated with a higher incidence of renal
scarring.

University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.

PURPOSE: The standard treatment for a duplex kidney with poorly functioning upper
pole moiety is ipsilateral upper pole heminephrectomy. This procedure is usually 
performed by open surgery, but with recent developments in techniques of
uro-laparoscopy, it can be done with it, safely. In this study we evaluated the
results and safety of laparoscopic heminephrectomy in our consecutive cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 2001 to May 2007 fourteen unilateral
laparoscopic heminephrectomy were performed in our center. Patients'
characteristics, presenting symptoms, operative time, and blood loss, early and
late complications were all collected retrospectively. Using pre-operative
ultrasonography, intravenous pyelography (IVP) and CT scanning, unilateral upper 
pole hydronephrosis was detected in all cases. By DMSA isotope scan
hypofunctioning of ipsilateral moieties was detected in all cases.
RESULTS: Mean operative time was 203±80 minutes. No major intra-operative or
early complications were identified. Mean hospital stay was 4.1 days. On mean
follow-up of 32 months no disturbing symptoms or episodes of urinary tract
infections (UTIs) were detected. Atrophic kidney was detected in one case in
post-operative IVP.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic heminephrectomy is a valuable minimal invasive procedure
that can be performed safely in experienced hands without any important
complication. Perfect renal pedicles vascular system manipulation is important
for the preservation of renal function post-operatively.

Patients with a history of infection and voiding dysfunction are at risk for
recurrence after successful endoscopic treatment of vesico ureteral reflux and
deserve long-term follow up.

Hospital", Rome, Italy.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Subureteral endoscopic injection of a bulking agent is an
attractive alternative to open surgery or antibiotic prophylaxis for vesico
ureteral reflux (VUR). Little information is available about long-term risk of
recurrence after an initially successful treatment. Aim of this paper was to
review short- and long-term success rate of endoscopic treatment in a single
Center series after risk stratification of individual patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 126 patients who underwent Deflux injection
for primary VUR were examined. Indications to treatment were an unvaried high
grade VUR (IV-V) at 1 year from diagnosis and/or and recurrent urinary tract
infection (UTI) on antibiotic prophylaxis even in the presence of mild grade VUR 
(III grade). Gender, age and mode of diagnosis, infections (UTI), voiding
dysfunctions, VUR grade and side, renal function, number of treatments were
correlated to outcome. Long-term evaluation was planned at a minimum of 1 year
from the last negative post-injection cystogram (MCUG). A new MCUG and DMSA scan 
were also offered to those complaining new UTI episodes. Late recurrences were
correlated to history and grade of reflux. Data were analyzed with Graph Pad
Instat software; the Chi-square test was used for univariate comparisons, the
Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.and multiple regression tests for
factors influencing outcome.
RESULTS: M/F ratio was 62 to 64; median age at diagnosis was 28 months. VUR
affected 198 renal units. Preinjection VUR grade was I in 1, II in 27, III in
107, IV in 59, and V in 4 units. Reduced DMSA uptake was evidenced in 51 units
and scarring in 24. Median age at treatment was 34.5 months, for persistent high 
grade VUR (IV-V) in 55 patients and recurrent IVU in 92. Two hundred sixty seven 
injections were performed on 198 ureters. Complete resolution was documented by
MCUG at 3-5 months in 68%, low grading < II in 20%, persistence or unsignificant 
reduction in 11%. Preoperative recurrent UTI, higher grade VUR, and bilaterality 
were correlated to a poorer surgical outcome. Among 80 successfully treated
cases, 12 complained of persistent UTI. Recurrence of VUR was demonstrated in 31%
of them. Deteriorated uptake or additional scarring in 25% was independent from
VUR recurrence. Preoperative recurrent UTI and voiding dysfunction correlated
significantly to late outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative recurrent IVU, together with high-grade reflux, seem to
correlate to lower success rate of Deflux injection for primary VUR. Even after
successful endoscopic treatment, long-term surveillance may be needed among these
cases, mainly if voiding dysfunction is also recorded. Late recurring VUR must be
actively excluded in case of new IVU episodes.

A remediation performance model for enhanced metabolic reductive dechlorination
of chloroethenes in fractured clay till.

A numerical model of metabolic reductive dechlorination is used to describe the
performance of enhanced bioremediation in fractured clay till. The model is
developed to simulate field observations of a full scale bioremediation scheme in
a fractured clay till and thereby to assess remediation efficiency and timeframe.
A relatively simple approach is used to link the fermentation of the electron
donor soybean oil to the sequential dechlorination of trichloroethene (TCE) while
considering redox conditions and the heterogeneous clay till system (clay till
matrix, fractures and sand stringers). The model is tested on lab batch
experiments and applied to describe sediment core samples from a TCE-contaminated
site. Model simulations compare favorably to field observations and demonstrate
that dechlorination may be limited to narrow bioactive zones in the clay matrix
around fractures and sand stringers. Field scale simulations show that the
injected donor is expected to be depleted after 5 years, and that without donor
re-injection contaminant rebound will occur in the high permeability zones and
the mass removal will stall at 18%. Long remediation timeframes, if
dechlorination is limited to narrow bioactive zones, and the need for additional 
donor injections to maintain dechlorination activity may limit the efficiency of 
ERD in low-permeability media. Future work should address the dynamics of the
bioactive zones, which is essential to understand for predictions of long term
mass removal.

Acute phase 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan in infants with first episode of
febrile urinary tract infection.

BACKGROUND: 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan is the golden standard for 
the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and renal scaring. We investigated the use 
of acute phase DMSA scan in infants presented promptly to the hospital because of
the first episode of their febrile urinary tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: Ninety-eight infants with microbiologically confirmed first episode of
febrile UTI were studied. DMSA scans were carried out within 7 days in these
infants after admission. Infants with an abnormal acute DMSA scan underwent a
second DMSA scan 6-12 months later.
RESULTS: Overall, acute DMSA scan was abnormal in 16 (16.3%) of the 98 patients. 
There were no differences in sex, age, fever over 38.5°C, blood inflammation
indices, or evidence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) between patients with normal 
and abnormal acute DMSA scan (P>0.05). However, infants with grade III to V VUR
as well as those with delayed treatment presented significantly increased renal
involvement by acute DMSA scan (P<0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of
abnormal acute DMSA scan to predict grade III to V VUR were 50% and 88%
respectively. Its positive and negative likelihood ratios were 4.16 and 0.57,
respectively. Of 16 children with abnormal initial DMSA scan results, 14
underwent a second DMSA scan. Follow-up DMSA scans were normal in 12 of the 14
children.
CONCLUSIONS: Parenchymal damage found in a minority of infants with febrile UTI
presented promptly to the hospital. Acute phase DMSA scan should be carried out
only in selected patients. An abnormal acute DMSA scan is a moderate predictor
for dilated VUR and its ability to exclude VUR is restricted.

BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines on urinary tract infection (UTI) agree on reducing 
the number of invasive procedures. None of these has been validated by a
long-term study. We describe our 11-years experience in the application of a
diagnostic protocol that uses a reduced number of invasive procedures.
METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the records of 406 children aged between 1
and 36 months at their first UTI. All patients underwent renal ultrasound (RUS). 
Children with abnormal RUS and those with UTI recurrences underwent voiding
cystourethrography (VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans.
RESULTS: RUS after the first UTI was pathological in 7.4% children; 4.4 % had a
second UTI. We performed 48 VCUG: 14 patients (29%) had vesicoureteral reflux
(VUR), 12 of which showed an abnormal RUS while 2 had recurrent UTI. After DMSA
renal scan renal damage appeared in only 6 of them (12.5%); all these children
showed grade IV VUR.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of our guidelines leads to a decrease in invasive
examinations without missing any useful diagnoses or compromising the child's
health.

Scintigraphy of the skeletal system is performed mainly with the use of
99mTc-MDP. There are other radiopharmaceuticals showing affinity to bone lesions:
99mTc-MIBG, 201Tl, 131I (in the case of papillary or follicular thyroid cancers),
and 99mTc (V) DMSA (in the case of medullary cancer). Currently, positron emitted
radioisotopes are also used in clinical practice. It seems that 18F-NaF/PET is a 
highly sensitive and specific modality for detection of metastases and other bone
lesions. Certain data concerning the role of 18F-FDG, 18F-choline, or
68Ga-DOTATATE can be found. The aim of this article is to review the role of
18F-NaF and 18F-FDG in diagnosis of bone metastases.

Aging of methabenzthiazuron, imidacloprid, and N,N-dimethylsulfamide in silty
soils and effects on sorption and dissipation.

Differences in soil properties can influence the fate of plant protection agents 
in the environment. The present study aims to investigate the sorption behavior
and related aging processes of imidacloprid (IMI; insecticide),
methabenzthiazuron (MBT; herbicide), and N,N-dimethylsulfamide (DMSA; degradate
of the fungicide tolylfluanid) in six soils of silty texture but otherwise
varying properties. The sorption behavior of these ¹⁴C-labeled compounds
exhibiting different physicochemical properties was characterized by applying a
three-step sequential extraction procedure. After 119 d, MBT revealed strongest
sorption (K'(tot) 47.4-200.4 L/kg), followed by IMI (K'(tot) 11.7-30.6 L/kg), and
DMSA with K'(tot) close to zero. Aged sorption factors (AFs) were calculated to
characterize aging processes over time exhibiting a 2.6-3.5-fold (IMI), a
1.8-4.5-fold (MBT), and no (DMSA) increase of sorbed amounts within 84 d.
Sorption and aging varied widely in the group of silty soils, which differed with
respect to organic matter content, C/N-ratio, and microbial soil parameters. The 
time-dependent increase of adsorption of MBT and IMI was more pronounced in those
soils that had a lower organic carbon and low microbial biomass content.
Concomitantly, MBT and IMI degradation decelerated, presumably because of aged
sorption at inner binding sites leading to a lower accessibility. In contrast, in
the soils with a higher organic carbon content a strong initial (but later still 
reversible) sorption of MBT and IMI, occurring presumably at outer surface sites,
reduced the extent of time-dependent diffusion toward inner binding sites.

AIMS: To analyze the results of treatment of major renal injuries according
imaging data in order to determine their function after follow-up.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 22 cases of fracture of
the kidney (grade V) in two pediatric surgical services that were reviewed over a
period of 16 years. After initial conservative treatment in 19 patients (86.5%), 
a scan and/or Uro-MRI were realized in all patients in monitoring evolving. Three
children with vascular injury were treated by interventional radiology. The
morphology and functional evolution of the injured kidney were determined.
RESULTS: A DMSA scan investigation was performed in 21 patients (95.5%)
associated with Uro-MRI in two cases; one patient was only explored with Uro-MRI.
A complete restitution of the renal parenchyma was confirmed in 10 children
(45.5%), we noted an atrophy of the upper pole in 30%, a lower pole atrophy in
4.5%, two complete renal atrophy in 9%. An urinoma was present in six patients
(27%) that required drainage in five cases and declined during the surveillance
in one case. Normal function of the injured kidney was noticed in half of grade V
(11 of 22 patients) with a mean follow-up of 19 months. None of our patients did 
present hypertension.
CONCLUSION: Non-operative conservative treatment in severe renal trauma was
efficient, morphological and functional sequelae were present in 50% on
scintigraphy and/or Uro-MRI.

NPs; binding efficiency was ~60%. The mean diameter of single core of
γ-Fe(2)O(3)-DMSA-DG NPs was 10 nm. Particle size and polydispersity index of its 
aggregates were 156.2 nm and 0.162, respectively. 2-DG-conjugated nanoparticles
caused little cytotoxic effects on Hela cells at the concentration range of
0-600 μg/mL. When 2-DG-conjuated and non-conjugated nanoparticles were incubated 
with Hela cells for 4, 8 and 12 h, the 2-DG-conjugated nanoparticle showed
significant amount of uptake in cells compared to their non-targeted
counterparts.
CONCLUSION: γ-Fe(2)O(3)-DMSA-DG NPs could be developed as a tumor-targeted probe 
for cervical cancer imaging and therapy.

Objective. With this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the main
aspects and currently used drugs for analgesia in shockwave lithotripsy. Evidence
Acquisition. We reviewed current literature, concentrating on newer articles and 
high-quality reviews in international journals. Results. No standardized
protocols for pain control in SWL exist, although it is crucial for treatment
outcome. General and spinal anaesthesia show excellent pain control but are only 
recommended for selected cases. The newer opioids and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs are able to deliver good analgesia. Interest in
inhalation anaesthesia with nitrous oxide, local anaesthesia with deep
infiltration of the tissue, and dermal anaesthesia with EMLA or DMSO has recently
rekindled, showing good results in terms of pain control and a favourable side
effect profile. Tamsulosin and paracetamol are further well-known drugs being
currently investigated. Conclusion. Apart from classically used drugs like
opioids and NSARs, medicaments like nitrous oxide, paracetamol, DMSA, or refined 
administration techniques for infiltration anaesthesia show a good effectiveness 
in pain control for SWL.

Monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA), a lipophilic chelating agent has emerged as a
promising drug for the treatment of arsenic. The present study aimed at exploring
the optimum dose and route of administration for achieving maximum arsenic
elimination with minimal side effects. We also carried out a pharmacokinetic
analysis of this drug to support arsenic chelation. Rats were exposed to arsenic 
(25 ppm) for 6 months and later received MiADMSA (50 or 100 mg/kg) orally and via
i.p. route for 5 days. Oxidative stress parameters and arsenic levels in soft
tissues, liver function test and histopathology of liver and kidney were
performed. Plasma kinetic of MiADMSA (plasma-free drug and total drug) at 50 and 
100 mg/kg p.o. was carried out. Arsenic exposure resulted in significant
oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity. MiADMSA at 50 mg/kg dose administered orally
provided about 45% and 75% protection against oxidative stress and in lowering
body arsenic burden, respectively, against 25% and 40% via i.p. route.
Pharmacokinetic analysis supported prolonged availability of the drug through
oral administration. Collectively, these findings led us to conclude that oral
administration of MiADMSA was more effective than intraperitoneal administration 
and that the minimum effective dose with least side effects was 50 mg/kg.

[Four infants with upper urinary tract infection due to extended-spectrum bata
lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli].

[Article in Japanese]

Bacteria producing extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) are detected mainly in
adult urinary specimens, and are believed to cause hospital-acquired infection
due to their resistance to many drugs. The incidence of community-acquired
infection due to such bacteria is increasing, but few cases of infant upper
urinary tract infection (UUTI) have been reported in Japan. We treated four
infants with UUTI caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, as determined by
genotyping. Using medical records, we retrospectively evaluated the clinical
course, antibiotic use and efficacy, antimicrobial susceptibility results, and
the presence of underlying disease. One of the four had been previously
hospitalized for occult bacteremia. Two developed UUTI after antibiotic
treatment, indicating that previous antibiotic use may have been a risk factor in
these cases. We could not identify the infection route in all cases. Two of the
four had bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Renal scintigraphy was done in
three. Although an initial dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) defect was detected in 
all four, only one had renal scarring. E. coli isolates from all four showed PCR 
signals for blaCTX-M-; one isolate positive for the blaCTX-M3 group and three
positive for blaCTX-M14. Antimicrobial susceptibility test results showed all
isolates to be resistant to cephalosporins, but discrepancies existed between
antimicrobial susceptibility results and actual clinical efficacy. Clinically,
cefazolin (CEZ) was effective in two subjects and ceftazidime (CAZ) effective in 
one. Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) was effective in one. None of the four
developed sepsis or meningitis. Post hospitalization antibiotic prophylaxis
showed that none of the four has had UUTI recur. Japan's ESBL-producing bacterial
infection incidence is increasing, so medical professionals should watch for such
UUTI even in first-case occurrence in infants.

INTRODUCTION: In literature, many controversies exist about courses and
terminology of the distal medial striate artery (DMSA) or recurrent artery first 
described by Heubner near 1872. The purpose of this study was to define the
accurate anatomy of this artery, to help the practitioners during surgery of the 
anterior cerebral-anterior communicating arteries (ACA-ACoA) complex.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 cranial bases were examined using magnification of the 
surgical microscope. One half for which the internal carotid arteries and
internal jugular veins were dissected, cannulated and perfused with colored
silicon on fresh cadavers; the other half only with arterial injection of
formalin-fixed normal adult human brains.
RESULTS: The artery arose principally from A2 segment (58%), always less than
5 mm up to downstream from ACA to ACoA junction. In 59.5% it had a recurrent
course anterior to A1 segment. It terminated in one to three stems which entered 
the medial part of the anterior perforated substance. The DMSA was present as a
single vessel in 95% of cases. Its main outer diameter was 0.7 mm and the length 
had an average of 24 mm.
CONCLUSION: Iatrogenic damage or occlusion leads to a mediobasal striatum
infarction with important neurological deficits such as brachiofacial hemiparesis
and aphasia. This artery should be routinely identified during clipping of ACoA
aneurysm. Special attention in this study was given to atypical posterior course 
or anatomic variations such as double DMSA on a same side.

We report a cross-sectional study performed to evaluate the imaging findings of
40 children, aged one month to five years (16.65 ± 14.97 months), who presented
with protracted fever of more than 48 hours due to urinary tract infection (UTI).
About 85% of the patients had positive Tc99-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan
and 58% had vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Kidney sonography aided in the diagnosis
and treatment in 10% of the patients. Age, sex, presence or laterality of VUR did
not contribute to defective DMSA scan (pyelonephritis) (P > 0.05). Delayed
diagnosis and treatment of febrile UTI is associated with a high incidence of
positive findings of DMSA scan irrespective of age, sex or presence/absence of
VUR. In mild VUR, the DMSA scan may be normal while in patients with moderate and
severe VUR the DMSA scan is almost always abnormal. Thus, our study shows that a 
normal DMSA scan can help in ruling out moderate to severe forms of VUR and that 
cystography remains an excellent and standard tool for the diagnosis of VUR.

A 3 years old boy with a history of surgery for orchidopexy was admitted to our
hospital with fever and abdominal pain. Clinical examination and laboratory
investigations revealed urinary tract infection with renal involvement.
Ultrasonography demonstrated a solitary left kidney and raised the suspicion of a
fusion anomaly. Voiding cystography disclosed grade III vesicoureteral reflux and
technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy revealed right to left
crossed renal ectopia with fusion (L-shaped kidney). The patient is undergoing
standard follow-up for the early detection of possible renal complications. In
conclusion, L-shaped kidney is a rare entity and the (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy
played an important role on timely diagnosis.

Urinary tract infections are common in children. The available gold standard
method for diagnosis, Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scan is expensive and
exposes patients to considerable amount of radiation. This study was performed to
compare and assess the efficacy of Power Doppler Ultrasound versus Tc-99m DMSA
scan for diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. A quasi experimental study was
conducted on 34 children with mean age of 2.8 ± 2.7 years who were hospitalized
with their first episode of febrile urinary tract infection. All children were
evaluated in the first 3 days of admission by Doppler Ultrasound and Tc-99m DMSA 
scan. Patients with congenital structural anomalies were excluded. Each kidney
was divided into three zones. The comparison between efficacy of Doppler
Ultrasound and DMSA scan was carried out based on number of patients and on
classified renal units. Based on the number of patients enrolled; the
sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy of
Doppler Ultrasound were 89%, 53%, 70%, 80% and 74%, respectively but based on the
renal units, it was 66%, 81%, 46%, 91% and 79% , respectively. Although Doppler
Ultrasound has the potential for identifying acute pyelonephritis in children,
but it is still soon to replace DMSA scan.

Inorganic mercury poisoning associated with skin-lightening cosmetic products.

Territories, Hong Kong, China. tykchan@cuhk.edu.hk

INTRODUCTION: Mercury and mercury salts, including mercurous chloride and
mercurous oxide, are prohibited for use in cosmetic products as skin-lightening
agents because of their high toxicity. Yet, the public continue to have access to
these products.
METHODS: Reports of skin-lightening cosmetic products containing mercury and
cases of mercury poisoning following the use of such products were identified
using Medline (1950 - 28 March 2011) with mercury, mercury compounds, mercury
poisoning, cosmetics and skin absorption as the subject headings. These searches 
identified 118 citations of which 31 were relevant.
TOXICOKINETICS: The rate of dermal absorption increases with the concentration of
mercury and prior hydration of the skin. The degree of dermal absorption varies
with the skin integrity and lipid solubility of the vehicle in the cosmetic
products. Ingestion may occur after topical application around the mouth and
hand-to-mouth contact. After absorption, inorganic mercury is distributed widely 
and elimination occurs primarily through the urine and feces. With long-term
exposure, urinary excretion is the major route of elimination. The half-life is
approximately 1-2 months.
FEATURES: The kidneys are the major site of inorganic mercury deposition; renal
damage includes reversible proteinuria, acute tubular necrosis and nephrotic
syndrome. Gastrointestinal symptoms include a metallic taste, gingivostomatitis, 
nausea and hypersalivation. Although penetration of the blood-brain barrier by
inorganic mercury is poor, prolonged exposure can result in central nervous
system (CNS) accumulation and neurotoxicity. Inorganic mercury poisoning
following the use of skin-lightening creams has been reported from Africa,
Europe, USA, Mexico, Australia and Hong Kong. Nephrotic syndrome (mainly due to
minimal change or membranous nephropathy) and neurotoxicity were the most common 
presenting features. As mercury-containing cosmetic products can contaminate the 
home, some close household contacts were also reported to have elevated urine
mercury concentrations.
ASSESSMENT: Prevention from further exposure is the first step. Cream users and
their close contacts should be evaluated for evidence of mercury exposure, the
presence of target organ damage and the need for chelation treatment. Laboratory 
evaluation of affected subjects should include a complete blood count, serum
electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, urinalysis, urine and blood mercury
concentrations. Since blood mercury concentrations tend to return to normal
within days of exposure, blood samples are useful primarily in short-term,
higher-level exposures. Estimation of the urine mercury concentration is the best
marker of exposure to inorganic mercury and indicator of body burden. A 24-hour
urine for measurement of mercury excretion is preferred; a spot urine mercury
concentration should be corrected for creatinine output.
MANAGEMENT: Chelation therapy is indicated in patients with features of mercury
poisoning and elevated blood and/or urine mercury concentrations. Unithiol
(2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid, DMPS) is the preferred antidote though
succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA) has also been employed.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of mercury in cosmetic products should be strictly
prohibited. The public should be warned not to use such products as their use can
result in systemic absorption and accumulation of mercury causing renal,
gastrointestinal and CNS toxicity.

OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with silent ureteral stones and expose their 
true influence on renal function.
METHODS: We analyzed 506 patients who had undergone ureterolithotripsy from
January 2005 to May 2010. Silent ureteral stones were calculi found in the
absence of any specific or subjective ureteral stone-related symptoms. Of the 506
patients, 27 (5.3%) met these criteria (global cohort). All patients were
assessed postoperatively with dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA). A
difference in relative kidney function of >10% was considered abnormal. Pre- and 
postoperative comparative DMSA analyses were electively obtained for 9 patients
(kidney function cohort). A t test was used to assess the numeric variables, and 
the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables.
Two-tailed P<.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Stones were diagnosed by radiologic abdominal evaluation for nonurologic
diseases in 40% and after previous nephrolithiasis treatment in 33%. The primary 
therapy was ureterolithotripsy in 88%. The mean follow-up time was 23 months. The
overall ureteral stone-free rate after 1 and 2 procedures was 96% and 100%,
respectively. In the global cohort, the mean pre- and postoperative serum
creatinine levels were similar (P=.39), and the mean postoperative function on
DMSA was 31%. In the kidney function cohort, no difference was found between the 
pre- and postoperative DMSA findings (22%±12.1% vs 20%±11.8%; P=.83) and serum
creatinine (0.8±0.13 mg/dL vs 1.0±0.21 mg/dL; P=.45).
CONCLUSION: Silent ureteral stones are associated with decreased kidney function 
present at the diagnosis. Hydronephrosis tends to diminish after stone removal,
and kidney function remains unaltered.

PURPOSE: To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous nephrolithotomy
(PCNL) for management of large renal stones between single-functioning kidney and
double-kidney patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty single-functioning kidneys and 30 double-kidney
patients with a mean age of 38.5 (±15.6) years in the single group and 42.1
(±14.3) years in the double group (range 11-72 years) underwent PCNL for renal
stones larger than 2 cm. The effect of PCNL on global and regional cortical
activity was measured using quantitative single-photon emission CT measurement of
technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan uptake by the
kidneys before and 6 months after PCNL. Variables assessed were stone bulk, size,
location, the number of punctures, and anatomic factors. Average hemoglobin and
serum creatinine changes, mean operative time, transfusion rate, hospital stay,
and different complications were also assessed.
RESULTS: Mean stone size, mean hospital stay, success rate, and complications
were statistically similar in both groups. Mean serum creatinine changes
(preoperative and postoperative) were not statistically significant between the
two groups (P=0.12). Mean hemoglobin drop (preoperative and postoperative) in
both groups was significant, and there was a valuable difference between them
(P=0.01). There was a significant difference in the uptake by the treated kidneys
before vs after PCNL between both groups statistically (P=0.019), so that the
DMSA renal uptake was obviously higher 6 months after PCNL in the double-kidney
group compared with its uptake in the single-functioning kidney group.
CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scan confirms that renal function was preserved or
even often improved after percutaneous stone removal, and the procedure had no
detrimental effects on renal function in both groups. There was no statistically 
significant difference between these groups in terms of morbidity and stone
clearance.

Korea. mamah77@paran.com

We assessed the role of therapeutic delay time (TDT) in acute renal cortical
scintigraphic lesion (ASL) and ultimate scar formation (USF) in children with
first febrile UTI and whether it is affected by the presence of vesico-ureteral
reflux (VUR). 230 children, 90 girls and 140 boys with first febrile UTI were
included. Radiologic (USG, DMSA, and VCUG), clinical (age, gender, peak fever,
therapeutic delay time) and laboratory (CBC with differential count, ANC
(absolute neutrophil count), BUN, Creatinine, urine analysis, gram stain,
culture, CRP and ESR) variables were analysed. DMSA was performed within 5 days
and after six months. VCUG was performed after acute phase of UTI. The
differences in TDT according to the presence of ASL, USF and VUR were assessed.
And the correlation between ASL or USF with the duration of TDT was assessed. Of 
230 patients enrolled, 142 patients had refluxing UTI and 88 patients had
non-refluxing UTI. TDT was the risk factor associated with ASL and USF along with
presence of VUR. TDT was longer in ASL positive group compared with the ASL
negative group. Also USF group showed longer TDT compared with those without USF 
in both refluxing UTI and non refluxing UTI. The TDT was significantly shorter in
USF group with the presence of VUR. Positive linear association was noted between
prevalence of ASL and USF and duration of TDT. In conclusion, the impact of UTI
on formation of USF may be enhanced by the presence of VUR with shorter duration 
of TDT.

Is a routine voiding cystourethrogram necessary in children after the first
febrile urinary tract infection?

Lee JH(1), Kim MK, Park SE.

(1)Department of Pediatrics, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University,
Seongnam, South Korea. naesusana@yahoo.co.kr

AIM: The aim of this study was to estimate the value of identifying
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and the benefit 
of VUR management according to imaging strategies at the first febrile urinary
tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: Children aged 1-144 months (n = 618) with the first febrile UTI admitted
at our hospital from 2000 to 2009 were enrolled. In all patients, renal sonogram 
(US), (99m) Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scanning and VCUG were
performed. Retrospective analyses per patient and per renal unit were performed.
RESULTS: Abnormal US or DMSA scans had a sensitivity of 100% and a negative
predictive value (NPV) of 100% to detect high-grade reflux. In hydronephrotic
kidneys, DMSA scanning had a sensitivity of 88.2% and a NPV of 97.1% to detect
high-grade reflux.
CONCLUSION: Routine VCUG is not required after the first febrile UTI in patients 
with normal US or normal DMSA scan. Even if the US reveals hydronephrosis,
routine VCUG is not necessary if the DMSA findings are normal. It is recommended 
that children who did not receive both a DMSA scan and VCUG after the first
febrile UTI should be followed up over the long term.

Successful use of electrochemical method to concentrate (99m)Tc obtained from a
zirconium molybdate (Zr(99)Mo) gel generator is reported. The process consists of
electrodeposition of the (99m)Tc in an oxalate bath on a small platinum electrode
followed by recovery of (99m)Tc in a small volume of normal saline. The overall
recovery of (99m)Tc was >90% with >99.99% radionuclidic purity and >99%
radiochemical purity. The compatibility of the product in the preparation of
(99m)Tc labeled formulations such as (99m)Tc-DMSA and (99m)Tc-EC was found to be 
satisfactory in terms of high labeling yields (>98%).

Urinary tract anomalies associated with high grade primary vesicoureteral reflux.

Hunziker M(1), Kutasy B, D'Asta F, Puri P.

Author information: 
(1)National Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Children's Hospital,
Dublin-12, Ireland.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the significance of associated urological 
anomalies in vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The aim of our study was to determine
the incidence of associated urological anomalies in patients with high grade VUR 
and to assess their impact on renal parenchymal scarring.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of 1,765 consecutive
cases diagnosed with high grade VUR (Grade III-V) at our hospital between 1998
and 2010. The diagnosis of VUR was made by a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG).
Renal scarring was evaluated by dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy and 
classified into three groups: mild (focal defects in uptake between 40 and 45%), 
moderate (uptake of renal radionuclide between 20 and 40%), and severe (shrunken 
kidney with relative uptake <20%). All associated urological anomalies were
diagnosed by ultrasound or VCUG or DMSA scan.
RESULTS: Associated urological anomalies were present in 229 (13%) children.
There were 87 boys and 142 girls. Duplex kidney was the main associated anomaly
occurring in 148 (64.6%) of the 229 patients. Other anomalies were: bladder
diverticulum in 29, solitary kidney in 12, ureterocele in 13, hypospadiasis in
11, pelviureteric junction obstruction in 9, malrotated kidney in 3, horseshoe
kidney in 2, crossed fused ectopia in 1 and renal cyst in 1. DMSA scan revealed
renal scarring in 105 (47.7%) of the 220 children who had a DMSA scan. 75 (50.7%)
children with duplex kidneys showed renal scarring.
CONCLUSION: Associated urological anomalies occur commonly in patients with high 
grade VUR. Our data shows that nearly half of the patients with VUR and
associated urological anomalies have renal scarring. Early recognition and
treatment of VUR patients with associated urological anomalies may decrease the
risk of renal parenchymal damage.

The aim of this work was to develop a selective method for quantification of
Sn(II) and Sn(IV) in dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), ethylcysteinate dimer (ECD),
methylenediphosphonic acid (MDP), and pyrophosphate radiopharmaceutical cold kits
by differential pulse polarography.METHODS: A dripping mercury electrode 150
polarographic/stripping analyzer with a conventional 3-electrode configuration
was used with 3 M H(2)SO(4) and 3 M HCl supporting electrolytes for Sn(II) and
Sn(IV), respectively. The polarographic analysis was performed using a 1-s drop
time, 50-mV·s(-1) scan rate, -50-mV pulse amplitude, 40-ms pulse time, and 10-mV 
step amplitude. To quantify Sn(IV), oxidation of Sn(II) by H(2)O(2) was
performed. The calibration curves for Sn(II) and Sn(IV) were obtained in the
range of 0-10 μg·mL(-1).
RESULTS: The analytic curves for Sn(II) in 3 M H(2)SO(4) and Sn(IV) in 3 M HCl
were represented by the following equations: i (μA) = 0.098 [Sn(II)] + 0.018
(r(2) = 0.998) and i (μA) = 0.092 [Sn(IV)] + 0.016 (r(2) = 0.998), respectively. 
The detection limits were 0.21 μg·mL(-1) for Sn(II) and 0.15 μg·mL(-1) for
Sn(IV). In DMSA, ECD, MDP, and pyrophosphate, 90.0%, 64.9%, 93.2%, and 87.5%,
respectively, of the tin was present as Sn(II). In this work, selective
determination of Sn(II) and Sn(IV) was achieved using 2 supporting electrolytes
(H(2)SO(4) and HCl). In 3 M H(2)SO(4), only Sn(II) produced a polarographic wave 
with the maximum current in -370 mV. Under the same conditions, no current could 
be determined for Sn(IV). In 3 M HCl, Sn(II) and Sn(IV) were electroactive and
the maximum currents of the 2 waves appeared in -250 and -470 mV. No other
components of the lyophilized reagents had any influence.
CONCLUSION: The developed polarographic method was adequate to quantify Sn(II)
and Sn(IV) in DMSA, ECD, MDP, and pyrophosphate cold kits.

INTRODUCTION: Partial nephrectomy is widely accepted as a therapeutic modality in
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients with single kidney, bilateral tumor or
deteriorated renal function. Currently, long-term survival studies have
consolidated partial nephrectomy as the treatment of choice for RCC in selected
patients with normal contralateral kidney.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between July 1990 and January 2008, a total of 102 partial 
nephrectomy were performed on 100 patients with pre-operative ultrasonography
diagnosis of renal carcinoma in 94 cases and complex renal cysts in 6 cases. The 
pre-operative ultrasonography size varied from 1.5 to 10 cm with an average of
4.85 cm.
RESULTS: Tumor size was correlated with the pathological stage, finding tumors in
stage pT1 with sizes less than and greater than 4 cm in 74% and 64%,
respectively, and in stage pT2 of 3.7% and 5.4%. Tumor size measured by
pre-operative CT scan was compared with the definitive size of the pathology
specimen in 93 cases (56<4 cm and 37>4 cm, according to the CT scan). We found
high concordance, however in the larger tumors, there was a tendency of the CT
scan to overestimate the size. A post-operative gamma scintigraphy with DMSA was 
performed in 40 patients. The values in the tumors <4 cm (21 patients) were
12-77% (average 43.3%). In tumors between 4 and 7 cm (17 patients), the values
were 13.8-53.3% (average 37.6%) and in 2 cases of tumors >7 cm the post-operative
DMSA showed 47.5 and 51%.
CONCLUSIONS: Partial nephrectomy is currently accepted as elective treatment in
incidental kidney tumors less than 4 cm and it is indicated increasingly more
frequently in larger tumors and of central localization. The finding of benign
pathology in the anatomic-pathology specimen in up to 20% of the incidental renal
tumors and low potential of malignancy of the possible satellite lesions in the
remnant kidney also support nephron-sparing surgery in these tumors.

Poor Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid uptake, re-evaluation with Tc-99m MAG3
scintigraphy in Lowe syndrome.

Research Hospital, Ulucanlar, Altindag, Ankara, Turkey.

Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is filtered through the glomeruli and
reabsorbed by the proximal tubules as low molecular weight proteins. In Lowe
syndrome this mechanism is impaired and so poor DMSA uptake is seen. Poor DMSA
uptake was shown in very few studies, but none mentioned normal Tc-99m MAG3
uptake. In this case, the patient had poor DMSA uptake, normal MAG3 uptake and a 
neurogenic bladder in anterior to the left kidney that attenuates left kidney.

Incidence of urinary tract infection in neonates with septicemia: a prospective
study.

Milani Hosseini S(1), Ataei N, Khalafi F, Sheikhvatan M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neonatology, University of Teheran, Teheran, Iran.

AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and clinical course
of urinary tract infection (UTI) in neonates with septicemia and also determine
the most common UTI manifestations in hospitalized neonates.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on consecutive febrile infants
aged 1 to 56 days that were hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit. In 
all neonates with positive urine culture, scintigraphy with
technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and ultrasonography (US)
were performed. Voiding cystourethrography was performed in the course of the
illness, generally within 5-7 days of hospitalization.
RESULTS: Positive blood culture was detected only in 9% of patients. However, 5% 
of them had positive urine culture. Positive abnormal US findings were present in
two of five (40%) and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was present in one of five
(20%) of infants with positive urine culture.
CONCLUSION: DMSA scan revealed renal parenchymal abnormalities in 3 of 5 (60%)
neonates with urosepsis. The incidence of UTI in neonates with septicemia is low.
All neonates with sepsis and positive urine culture should undergo a screening
renal scintigraphy and cystogram for identifying renal parenchymal involvement
and urinary tract abnormalities.

Plasma soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor in children with urinary 
tract infection.

Wittenhagen P(1), Andersen JB, Hansen A, Lindholm L, Rønne F, Theil J, Tvede M,
Eugen-Olsen J.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: In this prospective study we investigated the role of plasma levels of
soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) in children with urinary
tract infection.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We measured the levels of plasma suPAR during admission in 
42 children with suspected acute pyelonephritis and compared the results to acute
DMSA scintigraphy.
RESULTS: The mean level of plasma suPAR at admission was significantly elevated
in children with renal involvement (7.3 ng/ml) assessed by the DMSA scintigraphy 
compared to children without renal involvement (4.4 ng/ml, P = 0.010). The
positive predictive value of suPAR seems high, since all patients without renal
involvement had low suPAR values. During treatment the mean level of plasma suPAR
decreased.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that plasma suPAR could be of clinical use for the
diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and that high levels of plasma suPAR might
reflect the level of renal involvement and could therefore be a new indicator for
renal scarring.

Encapsulation of the flavonoid quercetin with an arsenic chelator into
nanocapsules enables the simultaneous delivery of hydrophobic and hydrophilic
drugs with a synergistic effect against chronic arsenic accumulation and
oxidative stress.

Ghosh S(1), Dungdung SR, Chowdhury ST, Mandal AK, Sarkar S, Ghosh D, Das N.

India.

Chronic arsenic exposure causes oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in
the liver and brain. The ideal treatment would be to chelate arsenic and prevent 
oxidative stress. meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is used to chelate
arsenic but its hydrophilicity makes it membrane-impermeative. Conversely,
quercetin (QC) is a good antioxidant with limited clinical application because of
its hydrophobic nature and limited bioavailability, and it is not possible to
solubilize these two compounds in a single nontoxic solvent. Nanocapsules have
emerged as a potent drug delivery system and make it feasible to incorporate both
hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. Nanoencapsulated formulations with QC and
DMSA either alone or coencapsulated in polylactide-co-glycolide [N(QC+DMSA)] were
synthesized to explore their therapeutic application in a rat model of chronic
arsenic toxicity. These treatments were compared to administration of quercetin
or DMSA alone using conventional delivery methods. Both nanoencapsulated
quercetin and nanoencapsulated DMSA were more effective at decreasing oxidative
injury in liver or brain compared to conventional delivery methods, but
coencapsulation of quercetin and DMSA into nanoparticles had a marked synergistic
effect, decreasing liver and brain arsenic levels from 9.5 and 4.8μg/g to 2.2 and
1.5μg/g, respectively. Likewise, administration of coencapsulated quercetin and
DMSA virtually normalized changes in mitochondrial function, formation of
reactive oxygen species, and liver injury. We conclude that coencapsulation of
quercetin and DMSA may provide a more effective therapeutic strategy in the
management of arsenic toxicity and also presents a novel way of combining
hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs into a single delivery system.

Glioma residual or recurrence versus radiation necrosis: accuracy of pentavalent 
technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid [Tc-99m (V) DMSA] brain SPECT compared to 
proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS): initial results.

We compared pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99m (V) DMSA) 
brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and proton magnetic
resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) for the detection of residual or recurrent
gliomas after surgery and radiotherapy. A total of 24 glioma patients, previously
operated upon and treated with radiotherapy, were studied. SPECT was acquired 2-3
h post-administration of 555-740 MBq of Tc-99m (V) DMSA. Lesion to normal (L/N)
delayed uptake ratio was calculated as: mean counts of tumor ROI (L)/mean counts 
of normal mirror symmetric ROI (N). (1)H-MRS was performed using a 1.5-T scanner 
equipped with a spectroscopy package. SPECT and (1)H-MRS results were compared
with pathology or follow-up neuroimaging studies. SPECT and (1)H-MRS showed
concordant residue or recurrence in 9/24 (37.5%) patients. Both were true
negative in 6/24 (25%) patients. SPECT and (1)H-MRS disagreed in 9 recurrences
[7/9 (77.8%) and 2/9 (22.2%) were true positive by SPECT and (1)H-MRS,
respectively]. Sensitivity of SPECT and (1)H-MRS in detecting recurrence was 88.8
and 61.1% with accuracies of 91.6 and 70.8%, respectively. A positive association
between the delayed L/N ratio and tumor grade was found; the higher the grade,
the higher is the L/N ratio (r = 0.62, P = 0.001). Tc-99m (V) DMSA brain SPECT is
more accurate compared to (1)H-MRS for the detection of tumor residual tissues or
recurrence in glioma patients with previous radiotherapy. It allows early and
non-invasive differentiation of residual tumor or recurrence from irradiation
necrosis.

INTRODUCTION: The role of vitamin A in re-epithelialization of the damaged
mucosal surfaces has been documented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
role of vitamin A in preventing renal scaring after acute pyelonephritis in
children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This clinical trial study was conducted in children with
acute pyelonephritis in Mofid Children Hospital (Tehran, Iran). Patients were
randomly divided into two groups to receive ceftriaxone and vitamin A or
ceftriaxone only. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy was performed
before the start of the treatment and 6 months later. Results were compared for
renal scaring between the two groups.
RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (11 boys and 65 girls) were enrolled. The mean age 
was 25 ± 24 months and 54 patients (71.1%) were under 2 years old. The average
vitamin A level was 71 ± 24 microg/dL in the treatment group and it was 62 ± 18
µg/dL in the control group. Baseline DMSA scans were comparable between the two
groups in terms of scarring (P = .53), but the second DMSA scans showed a
significant change in progression of the renal injury and scaring in the control 
group compared to those treated with vitamin A as well as antibiotic (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: We found administration of the vitamin A was useful in decreasing
the amount of the injury and scarring following the pyelonephritis. Based on our 
study, vitamin A can be used in conjunction with other treatments in the
management of acute pyelonephritis in children.

Radiographic evaluation of children with febrile urinary tract infection:
bottom-up, top-down, or none of the above?

Box 24, Chicago, IL 60614, USA.

The proper algorithm for the radiographic evaluation of children with febrile
urinary tract infection (FUTI) is hotly debated. Three studies are commonly
administered: renal-bladder ultrasound (RUS), voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG),
and dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scan. However, the order in which these tests
are obtained depends on the methodology followed: bottom-up or top-down. Each
strategy carries advantages and disadvantages, and some groups now advocate even 
less of a workup (none of the above) due to the current controversies about
treatment when abnormalities are diagnosed. New technology is available and still
under investigation, but it may help to clarify the interplay between
vesicoureteral reflux, renal scarring, and dysfunctional elimination in the
future.

Adjunctive oral methylprednisolone in pediatric acute pyelonephritis alleviates
renal scarring.

Huang YY(1), Chen MJ, Chiu NT, Chou HH, Lin KY, Chiou YY.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, National Cheng Kung University Medical College and
Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if glucocorticoids can prevent renal scar formation after
acute pyelonephritis in pediatric patients.
METHODS: Patients younger than 16 years diagnosed with their first episode of
acute pyelonephritis with a high risk of renal scar formation (ie, inflammatory
volume ≥ 4.6 mL on technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid scan [DMSA] or 
abnormal renal ultrasonography results) were randomly assigned to receive either 
antibiotics plus methylprednisolone sodium phosphate (1.6 mg/kg per day for 3
days [MPD group]) or antibiotics plus placebo (placebo group) every 6 hours for 3
days. Patients were reassessed by using DMSA 6 months after treatment. The
primary outcome was the development of renal scars.
RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were enrolled: 19 in the MPD group and 65 in the 
placebo group. Patient characteristics were similar between the 2 groups,
including the acute inflammatory parameters and the initial DMSA result. Renal
scarring was found in 33.3% of children treated with MPD and in 60.0% of those
who received placebo (P < .05). The median cortical defect volumes on follow-up
DMSA were 0.0 mL (range: 0-4.5 mL) and 1.5 mL (range: 0-14.8 mL) for the MPD and 
placebo groups, respectively (P < .01). Patients in the MPD group experienced
faster defervescence after treatment than the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive oral MPD therapy reduced the occurrence and/or severity
of renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis in these hospitalized children who
had a high risk of renal scar formation.

Discordant findings on dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy in children with
multi-detector row computed tomography-proven acute pyelonephritis.

PURPOSE: The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) is often difficult, as its
clinical and biological manifestations are non-specific in children. If not
treated quickly and adequately, however, APN may cause irreversible renal damage,
possibly leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. We were suspecting
the diagnostic value of (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan by
experiences and so compared the results of DMSA scan to those of multi-detector
row computed tomography (MDCT).
METHODS: We retrospectively selected and analyzed 81 patients who were diagnosed 
as APN by MDCT during evaluation of their acute abdomen in emergency room and
then received DMSA scan also for the diagnostic work-up of APN after admission.
We evaluated the results of imaging studies and compared the diagnostic value of 
each method by age groups, <2 years (n=45) and ≥2 years (n=36).
RESULTS: Among total 81 patients with MDCT-proven APN. DMSA scan was diagnostic
only in 55 children (68%), while the remaining 26 children (32%) showed false
negative normal findings. These 26 patients were predominantly male with average 
age of 21 months and most of them, 19 (73.1%) were <2 years of age.
CONCLUSION: DMSA scan has obvious limitation compared to MDCT in depicting acute 
inflammatory lesions of kidney in children with APN, especially in early
childhood less than 2 years of age. MDCT showed hidden lesions of APN, those were
undetectable through DMSA scan in children.

Cell labeling and tracking are becoming increasingly important in the fields of
stem cell transplantation. To track the migration and distribution of the
implanted cells is critical for understanding the beneficial effects of stem cell
therapy. The aim of this study is to synthesize new superparamagnetic
nanoparticles and investigate the feasibility of magnetic labeling of bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Monodisperse hydrophobic magnetite (Fe3O4)
nanoparticles were prepared through high temperature decomposition of Fe(acac)3
and a long-chain alcohol. The nanoparticles were further modified with a bipolar 
surfactant, 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and then transformed into
water-soluble iron oxide nanoparticles (WION). The magnetic particles showed
uniform size (10 nm), high efficiency and stability in MSCs labeling. The labeled
cells were cultured until passage 8, there is no reduction in magnetic tropism
and the percentage of labeled cells. The results of MTT proliferation assay and
flow cytometry analysis show that the WION are biocompatible. The labeling
process does not cause cell death and apoptosis, and has no side effect on growth
capacity of the cells. In conclusion, the successful and stable labeling of MSCs 
and the efficient magnetic tropism indicate that this WION can be used for
tracking of MSCs in future MSCs-based stem cell therapy.

PURPOSE: To investigate the targeting activity of the peptide (named P1c) derived
from connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) to αvβ3-rich tumor cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: P1c was synthesized and conjugated with
ultrasuperparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIOs) coated with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The specific binding activity of
P1c-USPIOs to αvβ3 was verified by solid phase binding assay. The combination of 
P1c-USPIOs with a human primary liver cancer cell (Bel 7402) with αvβ3-positive
expression and uptake of P1c-USPIOs by cells was investigated by Prussian blue
staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). The targeting activity of the probe in vivo was also evaluated using a
small-animal tumor model by MRI.
RESULTS: The cell uptake of P1c-USPIOs was observed in a dose-dependent manner,
whereas no significant particle uptake was found in the plain USPIOs group. The
differences on T2*-weighted imaging were also found by MRI and the signal
intensity (SI) was statistically reduced after coculture of Bel 7402 cells with
P1c-USPIOs at a concentration of 20-80 μg/mL compared with plain USPIOs (P <
0.05). The in vivo study showed that the signal reduction was distributed mainly 
in the periphery and some central areas of the tumor. The tumor-to-muscle CNR
(contrast-to-noise ratio) at 12 hours after the administration of the P1c-USPIOs 
was statistically significantly different compared to those at 0 hour, 1 hour, or
the plain USPIO group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The peptide P1c might be a good candidate as a targeting carrier for 
drugs or tracers.

The field-induced assembly of γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles under alternating magnetic
field of different frequency was investigated. It was found that the assembly was
dependent upon the difference between colloidal relaxation time and field period.
The same experiments on DMSA-coated γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles exhibited that the
relaxation time may be mainly determined by the magnetic size rather than the
physical size. Our results may be valuable for the knowledge of dynamic assembly 
of colloidal particles.

The intrinsic methylating abilities of the known biological methylating
zwitterionic agents, dimethylsulfonioacetate (DMSA), (CH(3))(2)S⁺CH(2)CO(2)(-)
(1) and glycine betaine (GB), (CH(3))(3)N⁺CH(2)CO(2)(-) (2), have been examined
via a range of gas phase experiments involving collision-induced dissociation
(CID) of their proton-bound homo- and heterodimers, including those containing
the amino acid arginine. The relative yields of the products of methyl cation
transfer are consistent in all cases and show that protonated DMSA is a more
potent methylating agent than protonated GB. Since methylation can occur at more 
than one site in arginine, the [M+CH(3)](+) ion of arginine, formed from the
heterocluster [DMSA+Arg+H](+), was subject to an additional stage of CID. The
resultant CID spectrum is virtually identical to that of an authentic sample of
protonated arginine-O-methyl ester but is significantly different to that of an
authentic sample of protonated N(G)-methyl arginine. This suggests that
methylation has occurred within a salt bridge complex of [DMSA+Arg+H](+), in
which the arginine exists in the zwitterionic form. Finally, density functional
theory calculations on the model salts, (CH(3)CO(2)(-))[(CH(3))(3)S(+)] and
(CH(3)CO(2)(-))[(CH(3))(4)N(+)], show that methylation of CH(3)CO(2)(-) by
(CH(3))(3)S(+) is both kinetically and thermodynamically preferred over
methylation by (CH(3))(4)N(+).

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To study the diagnostic and outcome aspects of
antenatally diagnosed primary megaureters and analyse the results of the
postnatal medicochirurgical management.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors report a retrospective analysis of 12 patients 
been born between 1998 and 2009 with primary megaureter antenatally diagnosed
between 20 and 32weeks of gestation. A postnatal radiological assessment
comprising urinary tract ultrasound, DTPA or MAG3 renal scintigraphy, retrograde 
cystography, DMSA renal scintigraphy and intravenous urography was performed. All
the patients were put under urinary antiseptic treatment and followed since the
birth.
RESULTS: This study comprised nine boys and three girls, all been born at term
with normal trophicity. Mean age of antenatal diagnosis of hydronephrosis was
26weeks of gestation. Mean age of definitive postnatal diagnosis was ten months. 
Left megaureter was seen in five children, right in two cases and five patients
had bilateral megaureter comprising a total of 17 renal units of which eight
units were non-obstructed/non-refluxing, three units were refluxing, five units
were obstructed and one unit was obstructed and refluxing. Megaureter was
associated to controlateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction syndrome in one
patient and to ipsilateral ureteral duplicity with a superior polar kidney in
another case. Renal function was less than 20% in four renal units. The mean
follow-up was four years (range : 10months to 11years). Outcome was marked by
urinary infections in seven cases of which four patients had
non-obstructed/non-refluxing megaureter. Six patients required surgical
correction, two for non-obstructed/non-refluxing megaureter complicated with
urinary recurring infections, three for obstructed megaureter with severe renal
functional deterioration and one patient for bilateral refluxing megaureter grade
V. Two other patients required surgical treatment, one for controlateral
ureteropelvic junction obstruction syndrome and the other for ipsilateral
ureteral duplicity with destroyed superior polar kidney. Mean age at surgery was 
22,6months (range : 6 months to 7 years).
CONCLUSION: Half of our patients with antenatal diagnosis of primary megaureter
required surgical correction. Urinary recurring infections, renal functional
deterioration less than 20% and importance of ureteral dilatation with
vesico-ureteric reflux grade V were predictive factors for surgery.

University, Shanghai, China.

Gold nanoshells have shown a great potential for use as agents in a wide variety 
of biomedical applications, and some of which require the delivery of large
numbers of gold nanoshells onto or into the cells. Here, we develop a ready
method to enhance the cellular uptake of gold nanoshells by modifying with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The quantifiable technique of
inductively coupled plasma atomic emissions spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the cellular
uptake of unmodified and DMSA-modified gold nanoshells. Three cell lines (RAW
264.7, A549, and BEL-7402) were involved and the results indicated that the
cellular uptake of the DMSA-modified gold nanoshells was obviously enhanced
versus the unmodified gold nanoshells. The reason possibly lies in the
nonspecific adsorption of serum protein on the DMSA-modified gold nanoshells
(DMSA-GNs), which consequently enhanced the cellular uptake. As a continued
effort, in vitro experiments with endocytic inhibitors suggested the DMSA-GNs
internalized into cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) pathway. This
study has provided a valuable insight into the effects of surface modification on
cellular uptake of nanoparticles.

Interventions for primary vesicoureteric reflux.

BACKGROUND: Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) results in urine passing retrograde up
the ureter. Urinary tract infections (UTI) associated with VUR have been
considered a cause of permanent renal parenchymal damage in children with VUR.
Management of these children has been directed at preventing UTI by antibiotic
prophylaxis and/or surgical correction of VUR. The optimum strategy is not clear.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of different treatment options for
primary VUR.
SEARCH STRATEGY: In August 2010 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE and
screened reference lists of papers and abstracts from conference proceedings.
SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs in any language comparing any treatment of VUR including
surgical or endoscopic correction, antibiotic prophylaxis, non-invasive
non-pharmacological techniques and any combination of therapies.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently searched the literature, 
determined study eligibility, assessed quality, extracted and entered data. We
expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence
intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean differences (MD) and their 95% CI's
Data were pooled using the random effects model.
MAIN RESULTS: Twenty RCTs (2324 children) were included. Long-term low-dose
antibiotic prophylaxis compared to no treatment/placebo did not significantly
reduce repeat symptomatic UTI (846 children: RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.17) or
febrile UTI (946 children: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.24) at two years. There was 
considerable heterogeneity in the analyses and only one study was adequately
blinded. At one to three years, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the risk of new or
progressive renal damage on DMSA scan (446 children: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to
0.80). Side effects were infrequent when reported, but antibiotics increased the 
likelihood of bacterial drug resistance threefold (132 UTIs: RR 2.94, 95% CI 1.39
to 6.25).When long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was compared with surgical or
endoscopic correction of VUR plus antibiotics for one to 24 months (10 studies,
1141 children), the risk of symptomatic UTI was not significantly different at
any time point. Combined surgical and antibiotic treatment caused a 57% reduction
in febrile UTI by five years (2 studies, 449 children: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27 to
0.70) but did not decrease the risk of new or progressive renal damage at any
time point. Postoperative obstruction was seen in 0% and 7% of children in two
surgical studies and 0% in one endoscopic study.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Compared with no treatment, use of long-term, low-dose
antibiotics did not significantly reduce the number of repeat symptomatic and
febrile UTIs in children with VUR. Considerable heterogeneity in the analyses and
inclusion of only one adequately blinded study, made drawing firm conclusions
challenging. Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of developing 
new or progressive renal damage, but assuming an 8% baseline risk, 33 children
would need long-term antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent one more child developing 
kidney damage over the course of two to three years.The added benefit of surgical
or endoscopic correction of VUR over antibiotic treatment alone remains unclear. 
Eight children would require combined surgical and antibiotic treatment to
prevent one additional child developing febrile UTI by five years, but it would
not cause fewer children developing renal damage.

AIM: This work represents the first reported investigation on the effects of
magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in nonhuman primates. Biodistribution,
biocompatibility and nanotoxicity of maghemite nanoparticles stabilized with
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were accessed.
MATERIALS & METHODS: A control animal was used and three other animals were
intravenously injected with DMSA-MNPs and euthanized 12 h, 30 and 90 days
following administration. Extracted organs were processed by histological
techniques. An additional animal was used to collect blood samples to
complementarily assess biocompatibility 12 h, 7, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days after
DMSA-MNP injection.
RESULTS: DMSA-MNPs were preferentially addressed to the lungs, liver and kidneys.
Hematological and serum biochemical results corroborated histological findings,
supporting DMSA-MNP biocompatibility while preserving both hepatic and renal
normal activity.
CONCLUSION: DMSA-MNPs were preferentially distributed to the lung, liver and
kidneys. Furthermore, DMSA-MNPs were considered biocompatible, supporting their
application as a promising nanomaterial platform for future biomedical use.

Acute Tc-99m DMSA scan for identifying dilating vesicoureteral reflux in
children: a meta-analysis.

Controversy exists regarding the type and/or sequence of imaging studies needed
during the first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in young children. Several
investigators have claimed that because acute-phase Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) renal-scan results are abnormal in the presence of dilating
vesicoureteral reflux, a normal DMSA-scan result makes voiding cystourethrography
(VCUG) unnecessary in the primary examination of infants with UTI. To evaluate
the accuracy of acute-phase DMSA scanning in identifying dilating (grades III
through V) vesicoureteral reflux documented by VCUG in children with a first
febrile UTI, we performed a meta-analysis of the accuracy of diagnostic tests as 
reported from relevant studies identified through the PubMed and Scopus
databases. Patient-based and renal unit-based analyses were performed. Overall,
13 cohort studies were identified. Nine studies involved patients younger than 2 
years, 3 involved children aged 16 years or younger, and 1 involved exclusively
neonates. Girls constituted 22% to 85% of the involved children. Pooled (95%
confidence intervals) sensitivity and specificity rates of DMSA scanning were 79%
and 53%, respectively, for the patient-based analysis (8 studies) and 60% and 65%
for the renal unit-based analysis (5 studies). The respective areas under the
hierarchical summary receiver operating curves were 0.71 and 0.67. Marked
statistical heterogeneity was observed in both analyses, as indicated by I(2)
test values of 91% and 87%, respectively. Acute-phase DMSA renal scanning cannot 
be recommended as replacement for VCUG in the evaluation of young children with a
first febrile UTI.

EDTA redistribution of lead and cadmium into the soft tissues in a human with a
high lead burden - should DMSA always be used to follow EDTA in such cases?

Intravenous sodium calcium ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) and oral
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) have both been used to reduce the burden of
lead in humans. Each of these agents enhances the mobilization of lead from
different areas of the body - EDTA from the trabecular bone and DMSA from the
soft tissue. A study of Korean battery workers revealed that EDTA appeared to
increase the soft tissue burden of lead, resulting in increased levels of
aminolevulinic acid and greater subsequent lead mobilization with DMSA. This case
report discusses a patient with a higher-than-normal lead burden who exhibited
increased tissue lead burden after intravenous EDTA. The elevated tissue burden
of lead was still present, albeit lower, after five consecutive days of oral DMSA
therapy. If this single case is representative of a typical human response to the
use of intravenous (IV) EDTA for lead, then it suggests that all persons
undergoing such treatment should be administered oral DMSA for a minimum of one
week after EDTA treatment.

Study on 99mTc-MAG3 and 99mTc-DMSA renal accumulation using in vitro cellular
model.

and Toxicology, Hradec Králové, Czech Republic.

Mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) labelled with 
technetium-99m belongs to standard renal radiodiagnostics. However, the renal
transport mechanisms responsible for their high renal uptake have not been fully 
explained. In addition, no in vitro experimental study comparing the renal uptake
of these radiopharmaceuticals at the cellular level has not been performed. The
investigation compared the 99mTc-MAG3 and 99mTc-DMSA renal uptake using primary
rat renal cells and evaluated contribution of active and passive transport
processes to the renal accumulation. The renal cells were isolated from the rat
kidneys by means of the two-phase collagenase perfusion method. The used
experimental model showed to be useful tool for such type of investigation. The
results documented significant quantitative and qualitative differences in the
accumulation of 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-MAG3 in the rat isolated cells. The found
experimental data indicated several times higher uptake of 99mTc-MAG3 than that
found in 99mTc-DMSA. 99mTc-MAG3 cellular uptake was substantially decreased when 
active, energy-dependent processes were inhibited. However, 99mTc-DMSA
accumulation in the renal cells demonstrated only a minor dependency on energy.
These findings demonstrate a very different character of the membrane transport
determining 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-MAG3 renal accumulation.

Effects of DMSA-coated Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles on global gene expression of 
mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells.

Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, China.

Fe(3)O(4) magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) coated with 2,3-dimercaptosuccinnic acid 
(DMSA) are considered to be a promising nanomaterial with biocompatibility. In
the present study, the effects of DMSA-coated Fe(3)O(4) MNPs on the expression of
all identified mouse genes, which regulate various cellular biological processes,
were determined to establish whether this nanoparticle is cytotoxic to mammalian 
cells. Mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells were treated with 100μg/ml of DMSA-coated 
Fe(3)O(4) MNPs for 4, 24 and 48h, and the global gene expression was detected via
Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChips(®) microarrays. It was found that gene 
expression of 711, 545 and 434 transcripts was significantly altered by 4-, 24-
and 48-h treatments, respectively. Of these genes, 27 were consistently
upregulated and 6 were consistently downregulated at the three treatment
durations. Bioinformatic analysis of all differentially expressed genes revealed 
that this nanoparticle can strongly activate inflammatory and immune responses
and can inhibit the biosynthesis and metabolism of RAW264.7 cells at a dose of
100μg/ml. These results demonstrated that DMSA-coated Fe(3)O(4) MNPs display
cytotoxicity in this type of macrophage at high doses.

The coupling of the 1-carboxyl of DMSA with l-amino acids led to a class of novel
1-(carbonyl-l-amino-acid)-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acids (DMSA--amino acid
conjugates, DMSA-Gly, -Ser, -Val, -Leu, -Ile, -Asn, -Asp, -Gln, -Glu, -Met, -Phe,
and -Trp). In the in vivo evaluation of Pb-loaded mice, 0.4 mmol/kg of the
conjugates effectively decreased the Pb levels of the femur, brain, kidney,
liver, and blood, greatly enhanced urination, and increased the Pb levels of both
urine and feces, while causing no redistributions of Pb to the other organs,
especially to the brain. With respect to lowering the bone and brain Pb,
DMSA-Ile, -Asn, -Gln, and -Met were more effective than DMSA. This benefit was
attributed to their high transmembrane ability. In contrast to Pb, the essential 
metals such as Fe, Cu, Zn, and Ca of the treated mice were not affected by the
administration of the conjugates. Silico molecular modeling predicted that the
conjugates had little hepatotoxicity, except possibly for DMSA-Phe.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection disease in all age.
From the pediatric urology point of view, difficulty in bladder emptying is the
most favorable factor for UTI. Early ultrasonographic (USG) investigation is
necessary to detect urinary obstruction and urolithiasis. It is important to
perform USG with filled bladder and directly after micturition. Voiding
cystourethrogram (VCUG) should be done after UTI in small children (below 3 years
of age). For the detection of renal damage the DMSA-scan is the most sensitive
method that should be performed during UTI and 6 months later. In case of bladder
dysfunction suspicion the uroflowmetry is substantial. Detection of leucocyturia 
give rise to microbiological diagnosis and proper treatment. UTI with fever needs
antibiotic therapy started in first 24 hours to prevent renal damage. Risk factor
for recurrences are bladder dysfunction and residual urine. Prophylaxis should
not be restricted to the use of antibiotics or other prophylactic agents but must
include the efficient management of bladder and bowel dysfunction and proper
liquids administration.

Renal parenchymal damage after percutaneous nephrolithotomy with one-stage tract 
dilation technique: a randomized clinical trial.

PURPOSE: To compare the effects of one-stage vs gradual dilation techniques
during percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) on postoperative renal scar formation 
and overall renal function.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 152 adult patients who underwent surgery during the
study period, 48 were randomized into two groups. In group 1 (n=19), gradual
tract dilation with Alken metallic dilators was used, and in group 2 (n=29),
one-stage tract dilation was used. We compared patient demographics,
intraoperative and preoperative parameters, postoperative overall renal function,
and renal scar formation on the target renal pole.
RESULTS: Access time (P=0.001; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.19-6.30) and
radiation exposure during access (P=0.03; 95% CI: 0.03-0.66) were significantly
shorter in group 2. In group 1, the decrease in mean technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (99m-Tc DMSA) uptake from 44.1±20.1% to 43.4±19.6% 4
weeks postoperatively (-0.7%±0.5%; P=0.27; 95% CI: -0.56-1.93) was not
significant. In group 2, however, there was a significant decrease in post-PCNL
99m-Tc DMSA uptake 2 (-2.4±0.3%, from 50.1±13.5% to 47.7±13.8%; P=0.001; 95% CI: 
1.13-3.66). Four weeks after surgery, new scar formation or progression of the
preoperative scar at the site of access were seen in 14 of 29 (48.3%) patients
who were treated with one-stage dilation whereas only 2 of 19 (11.0%) patients
who were treated with gradual dilation developed new scarring at the access site 
(P=0.007).
CONCLUSION: Although the one-stage tract dilation technique reduced radiation
exposure and access time, in the short term, it may cause more parenchymal damage
than the gradual dilation technique.

PURPOSE: To evaluate outcomes following laparoscopic heminephrectomy (LHN) in
duplex kidneys in the pediatric population, focusing on the fate of the remnant
moiety.
METHODS: 142 patients underwent laparoscopic heminephrectomy for duplex kidney
across 4 different institutions in the U.S. and Europe. Median age at surgery was
11.4 months. A retroperitoneoscopic approach was used in all patients, with 82
(57.7%) patients placed in posterior prone position (PPR), and 60 (42.3%) in
lateral retroperitoneal (LRP). Follow up included routine ultrasound, and DMSA
was performed in the event of abnormalities in ultrasound or postoperative
course.
RESULTS: Median operative time was 120 min. 11 patients (7.7%) required open
conversion, the majority of which (8/11) occurred prior to 2000. Median hospital 
stay was 2 days and no major complications were observed. 7 patients (4.9%)
developed a postoperative urinoma, and 1 patient required ureterectomy for
urinary tract infection. With a median follow-up of 4.5 years, 7 children (4.9%) 
experienced significant loss of function in the remaining moiety, with 3 patients
requiring completion nephrectomy. Of patients losing their remaining moiety,
median age at surgery was 9 months [4 - 42], and all except 1 (6/7) had an upper 
pole heminephrectomy. Three patients in this group (42%) experienced an immediate
postoperative complication (hematoma, UTI, urinoma). No consistent preoperative
or technical factors were consistent in the renal loss group.
CONCLUSIONS: LHN for duplex kidney produces satisfactory outcomes in the
pediatric population. With a median follow up of 4.5 years, we demonstrate a
non-functioning renal moiety rate of 5%. We did not identify any clinical
predictors of this outcome in our series, although upper pole heminephrectomy,
patient age, and postoperative complications may be contributing factors.

The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship of mammographic breast
density (BD) and cell proliferation/focal adhesion kinase activation-seeking
radiotracer technetium 99m pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc(V)-DMSA)
uptake in women with different breast histologies, that is, mild epithelial
hyperplasia (MEH), florid epithelial hyperplasia (FEH), mixed ductal carcinoma in
situ with invasive ductal carcinoma (DCIS + IDC), and pure IDC. Fifty-five women 
with histologically confirmed mammary pathologies were submitted preoperatively
to mammography and 99mTc(V)-DMSA scintimammography. The percentage and intensity 
of 99mTc(V)-DMSA uptake and the percentage of BD were calculated by
computer-assisted methods and compared (t-test) between the breast
pathologies. In breasts with increased BD, FEH and DCIS + IDC were found. On the 
contrary, pure IDC and MEH were identified in breasts with significantly lower BD
values. In breasts with increased 99mTc(V)-DMSA area and intensity of uptake, FEH
was the main lesion found compared to all other histologies. Linear regression
analysis between BD and 99mTc(V)-DMSA uptake area and intensity revealed
significant coefficients of correlation (r  =  .689, p < .001 and r  =  .582, p <
.001, respectively). Increased BD correlates with the presence of FEH and mixed
DCIS + IDC but not with pure IDC or MEH. Its close relationship to 99mTc(V)-DMSA,
which also showed an affinity to FEH, indicates that stromal microenvironment may
constitute a specific substrate leading to progression to different subtypes of
cancerous lesions originating from different pathways.

Probability of urinary tract infection in infants with ureteropelvic junction
obstruction: is antibacterial prophylaxis really needed?

In infants with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), the risk of urinary
tract infection (UTI) is unknown, and there is a lack of prospective studies
showing definitive evidence regarding the benefits and necessity of antibiotic
prophylaxis. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of UTI in infants with 
UPJO and to determine whether the risk varies according to the degree of
hydronephrosis. Infants with hydronephrosis detected prenatally or within the
postnatal 28th day and who had no previous history of UTI were followed
prospectively without antibacterial prophylaxis. Imaging studies were performed
according to our Pediatric Uro-Nephrology Study Group protocol.
Dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) scintigraphy was performed in all infants at the end
of 1 year of follow-up. Eighty-four infants (56 boys, 28 girls) were included in 
the study. The distribution of patients in each hydronephrosis grading group was 
incidentally similar. Within a median follow-up period of 18 (12-24) months, none
of the patients had UTI. Furthermore, no pyelonephritic scar was found on DMSA
scans in any patient. We conclude that prophylactic antibiotic usage is not
indicated in infants with UPJO, regardless of the severity of hydronephrosis, as 
the risk of UTI is minimal in this population.

The effects of intraperitoneal administration of dimethylsulfonioacetate (DMSA), 
dimethlsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and methylmethionine (MeMet) solutions (10 mM
each) on the body weights and the hematological parameters (red and white blood
cells) of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC)-bearing mice were examined for up to 10
d. Body weights significantly increased in the EAC-bearing mice treated with and 
without MeMet in contrast to those with DMSA and DMSP. This increase was
attributed to the increased amounts of ascitic fluid. EAC-bearing mice with and
without MeMet both showed abnormal values of hematological parameters, while
those with DMSA and DMSP exhibited almost normal levels on the 10th day.

1. Gallium arsenide (GaAs), a semiconductor, exerts toxicity as a result of its
constitutive moieties; that is, gallium and arsenic that becomes dissociated
after exposure. The present study focuses on reducing arsenic concentration from 
the target organs using monoesters of meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
either individually or in combination. 2. Animals were exposed to GaAs (0.0014
mol/kg, orally for 8 weeks) and then treated with monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA),
monocyclohexyl DMSA (MchDMSA) or monomethyl DMSA (MmDMSA) either individually
(0.3 mmol/kg, orally) or in combination (0.15 mmol/kg each, orally) for five
consecutive days. 3. GaAs exposure significantly inhibited blood δ-aminolevulinic
acid dehydrogenase (ALAD), suggesting alterations in the heme synthesis pathway. 
Whereas a significant increase in blood, liver and kidney reactive oxygen species
accompanied by an increase in lipid peroxidation points to the involvement of
oxidative stress in GaAs toxicity. 4. GaAs also significantly disturbed
glutathione metabolism. Hepatic and renal catalase activity decreased
significantly, whereas hepatic and renal superoxide dismutase activity, as well
as serum transaminases activity, showed marginal increase. Treatment with MiADMSA
in combination with MchDMSA showed better therapeutic efficacy compared with
other treatments in the aforementioned variables. 5. Co-administration of MiADMSA
with MchDMSA provided better therapeutic effects, including reduction of arsenic 
burden, compared with all other treatments.

AIMS: Preservation of renal function in children with congenital neurogenic
bladder is an important goal of treatment for the disease. This study analyzed
the evolution of renal function in patients with congenital neurogenic bladder.
METHODS: We reviewed the records of 58 pediatric patients with respect to the
following attributes: gender, age, etiology of neurogenic bladder, reason for
referral, medical/surgical management, episodes of treated urinary tract
infections, urodynamics, DMSA scintigraphy, weight, height, blood pressure,
glomerular filtration rate, microalbuminuria and metabolic acidosis. Statistical 
analysis was performed, adopting the 5% significance level.
RESULTS: The mean age at presentation was 4.2 ± 3.5 years. Myelomeningocele was
the most frequent etiology (71.4%). Recurrent urinary tract infection was the
reason for referral in 82.8% of the patients. Recurrent urinary tract infections 
were diagnosed in 84.5% of the patients initially; 83.7% of those patients
experienced improvement during follow-up. The initial mean glomerular filtration 
rate was 146.7 ± 70.1 mL/1.73 m²/min, and the final mean was 193.6 ± 93.6 mL/1.73
m²/min, p = 0.0004. Microalbuminuria was diagnosed in 54.1% of the patients
initially and in 69% in the final evaluation. Metabolic acidosis was present in
19% of the patients initially and in 32.8% in the final assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient referral to a pediatric nephrologist was late. A reduction
in the number of urinary tract infections was observed with adequate treatment,
but microalbuminuria and metabolic acidosis occurred frequently despite adequate 
management.

Unimolecular chemistry of doubly protonated zwitterionic clusters.

of Chemistry and Bio21 Institute of Molecular Science and Biotechnology, The
University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry experiments have been used
to study the fragmentation and electron-ion interactions of doubly charged
zwitterionic clusters, [M(15) + 2H](2+) (where M = Glycine Betaine (GB),
(CH(3))(3)N(+)CH(2)CO(2)(-), and Dimethylsulfonioacetate (DMSA),
(CH(3))(2)S(+)CH(2)CO(2)(-)) which are close to the stability limit, i.e., the
Coulomb repulsion of the charge within the cluster competes with attractive
forces. The intercluster chemistry was studied using collision-induced
dissociation (CID) and electron-induced dissociation (EID) in which the energy of
the electrons has been varied from >0 to 30 eV. Experimental results suggest that
the zwitterionic binding energy in the clusters follow the order GB > DMSA, which
is consistent with theoretical calculations that highlight that the lower dipole 
moment of DMSA leads to a binding energy of DMSA that is 0.86 times smaller than 
that for GB. Multiply protonated clusters of both GB and DMSA dissociate through 
Coulomb explosion, which is in competition with neutral evaporation for DMSA.
Electronic excitation of the cluster under EID conditions at higher electron
energies >12 eV can lead to new intercluster reactions associated with bond
cleavages where differences between the sulfur and nitrogen betaines are minor.

University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) modified ultra-small particles of iron oxide
(USPIO) were synthesized through a two-step process. The first step: oleic acid
(OA) capped Fe(3)O(4) (OA-USPIO) were synthesized by a novel oxidation
coprecipitation method in H(2)O/DMSO mixing system, where DMSO acts as an oxidant
simultaneously. The second step: OA was replaced by DMSA to obtain water-soluble 
nanoparticles. The as-synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by TEM, FTIR, 
TGA, VSM, DLS, EDS and UV-vis. Hydrodynamic sizes and Peroxidase-like catalytic
activity of the nanoparticles were investigated. The hydrodynamic sizes of the
nanoparticles (around 24.4 nm) were well suited to developing stable nanoprobes
for bio-detection. The kinetic studies were performed to quantitatively evaluate 
the catalytic ability of the peroxidase-like nanoparticles. The calculated
kinetic parameters indicated that the DMSA-USPIO possesses high catalytic
activity. Based on the high activity, immunohistochemical experiments were
established: using low-cost nanoparticles as the enzyme instead of expensive HRP,
Nimotuzumab was conjugated onto the surface of the nanoparticles to construct a
kind of ultra-small nanoprobe which was employed to detect epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) over-expressed on the membrane of esophageal cancer cell. 
The proper sizes of the probes and the result of membranous immunohistochemical
staining suggest that the probes can be served as a useful diagnostic reagent for
bio-detection.

Itraconazole (ITZ) is a drug used to treat various fungal infections and may
cause side effects. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the in
vitro activity of DMSA-PLGA nanoparticles loaded with ITZ against
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, as well as their cytotoxicity. Nanoparticles were 
prepared using the emulsification-evaporation technique and characterized by
their encapsulation efficiency, morphology (TEM), size (Nanosight) and charge
(zeta potential). Antifungal efficacy in P. brasiliensis was determined by
minimal inhibition concentration (MIC), and cytotoxicity using MTT assay. ITZ was
effectively incorporated in the PLGA-DMSA nanoparticles with a loading efficiency
of 72.8 +/- 3.50%. The shape was round with a solid polymeric structure, and a
size distribution of 174 +/- 86 nm (Average +/- SD). The particles were
negatively charged. ITZ-NANO presented antifungal inhibition (MIC = 6.25 ug/mL)
against P. brasiliensis and showed lower in vitro cytotoxicity than free drug
(ITZ).

Can Tc 99m DTPA be Used in Adult Patients in Evaluation of Relative Renal
Function Measurement as the Reference Tc 99m DMSA Method?

Yalçın H(1), Ozen A, Günay EC, Ozaslan IA, Ozer C.

Hatay, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: In the literature, there are many reports comparing relative renal
function calculated with Tc 99m DTPA and Tc 99m DMSA in adults and children.
However, there is no consensus about the results. As there is indeterminacy in
the reliability of Tc 99m DTPA for the calculation of the relative renal
functions, we retrospectively designed a study to compare the relative renal
functions measured with Tc 99m DMSA and Tc 99m DTPA in adult patients with renal 
diseases Material and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 144
patients who applied to Nuclear Medicine Department of three hospitals between
2009 and 2010 and who had both dynamic and static renal imaging. Renal dynamic
scintigraphies were compared to the relative function measured using Tc 99m DMSA 
static scintigraphy. Comparison of relative renal function measurements using
dynamic and static renal scintigraphies was performed using Pearson correlation
test. The comparison results were expressed with Bland-Altman analysis.
RESULTS: The study was conducted with 144 patients and 288 kidneys. Fifty six of 
patients were male. Mean age was 39.9±15.2 years. Thirty four patients had
hydronephrosis, 28 pyelonephritis, 53 renal calculi, 3 chronic renal failure, 2
acute renal failure, 1 benign renal neoplasia, 15 renal atrophy, 8 ureteropelvic 
junction stenosis. Relative renal function was calculated in Tc 99m DMSA and 99m 
Tc-DTPA studies. The mean relative renal functions measured with Tc 99m DTPA was 
52.54±23.09% and 47.25±23.09, with Tc 99m DMSA 52.85±21.80% and 47.07±21.77% for 
right and left kidneys, respectively. In bivariate correlation analysis (Pearson)
a significant positive correlation was found between the relative renal functions
calculated with Tc 99m DTPA and Tc 99m DMSA (r =0.937, p< 0.001). In Bland-Altman
plots, the mean difference between two methods was 0.3 and the correlation limits
were between 16.2 to -15.5.
CONCLUSION: As a result, we concluded that Tc 99m DTPA is also a good method for 
the relative renal function evaluation when compared to Tc 99m DMSA scan.
Although Tc 99m DMSA is the most reliable method for the calculation of relative 
renal function, Tc 99m DTPA can be another choice for the calculation of relative
renal function without a complementary DMSA scan particularly in patients who
require renogram curve and GFR calculations.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the cytoprotective effect of
L-carnitine against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and to compare its efficacy 
with that of amifostin by quantitative renal Tc 99m DMSA uptake.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups of
six animals each. 1) Control (saline; 5 ml/kg intraperitoneally); 2) L-carnitine 
(CAR; 300 mg/kg intraperitoneally); 3) Amifostine (AMI; 200 mg /kg
intraperitoneally); 4) Cisplatin (CIS;7 mg/kg intraperitoneally); 5) Cisplatin
plus L-carnitine (CIS + CAR); 6) Cisplatin plus amifostine (CIS + AMI).
L-carnitine and amifostine were injected 30 minutes before cisplatin in Group 5
and 6. Tc 99m DMSA, 7.4 MBq/0.2 ml, was injected through the tail vein 72 hours
after the drug administration. Rats were killed and kidneys removed by dissection
2 hours after the injection of the radiopharmaceutical. The percentage of the
injected dose per gram of kidney tissue (%ID/g) was calculated. Renal function
was monitored by measuring BUN and plasma levels of creatinine. Lipid
peroxidation and glutathione content were determined by measuring malondialdehyde
(MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in kidney tissue homogenates.
RESULTS: Tc 99m DMSA uptake per gram tissue of the kidney as %ID/g was
29.54±4.72, 29.86 ± 7.47 and 26.37 ± 4.54 in the control, CAR and AMI groups
respectively. %ID/g was the lowest of all the groups, 11.60±3.59 (p<0.01), in the
cisplatin group. Carnitine or amifostine administration 30 minutes before
cisplatin injection resulted a significant increase in %ID/g, 21.28±7.73 and
18.97±3.24 respectively, compared to those of cisplatin-treated rats (p<0.002). A
marked increase in plasma BUN and creatinine indicating nephrotoxicity and acute 
renal failure was observed in the cisplatin-treated group. MDA and GSH levels
were concordant with cisplatin-induced oxidative stress in the kidney tissue.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that L-carnitine significantly attenuates the
cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity as amifostin.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome, type 2B (MEN 2B), is a rare entity
characterized by the presence of medullary thyroid cancer in 100% of the cases.
The phenotype of this syndrome consists in the presence of marfanoid features and
mucocutaneous neuromas. We describe the case of a male patient with MEN 2B
syndrome who was diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer after lung metastases
was found. We analyze the role of DMSA-V and the new hybrid SPECT-CT scan systems
in the extension study and monitoring of medullary thyroid cancer.

In this study we investigated the influence of technical factors (positioning,
background (BG) correction and attenuation correction) on qualitative and
quantitative (absolute (AU) and relative (RU) uptake) assessment of feline
kidneys with (99m)technetium labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA).
Eleven healthy adult cats were included. Influence of BG and depth correction on 
quantitative assessment was evaluated. Depth correction was based on the
geometric mean method (using dorsal and ventral images) and the use of two
standards placed over each individual kidney. Visual evaluation showed
superiority of dorsal and ventral over lateral positioning due to increased
separation of the kidneys permitting region of interest (ROI) placement without
overlap. No apparent influence of BG correction was found for RU. However, AU was
systematically overestimated without BG correction. Depth correction did not seem
to affect RU in most cases, however, in some cats the differences were not
negligible. The values for AU without depth correction were lower compared to
depth corrected values.

Glucose transporter (Glut), a cellular transmembrane receptor, plays a key role
in cell glucose metabolism and is linked to a poor prognosis in various human
cancers. In this study, we prepared γ-Fe(2)O(3) NPs coated with DMSA, in which
modified with 2-DG, then γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA-DG NPs was constructed. The specific
interactions between Glut1-overexpressing tumor cells (MDA-MB-231) and
γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA-DG NPs were observed using Prussian blue staining and
transmission electron microscope (TEM), and found that γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA-DG NPs
were absorbed targetedly by the cells. Furthermore, the capacity of transporting 
SPIOs into tumor cells using these γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA-DG NPs was evaluated with a
1.5 T clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. It was found that the
acquired MRI T2 signal intensity of MDA-MB-231 cells that were treated with the
γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA-DG NPs decreased significantly, and it was inhibited by
competition with antibody of Glut1. Our results suggest that γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA-DG 
NPs are a useful targeting to Glut1-overexpressing tumor cells in vitro and that 
γ-Fe(2)O(3)@DMSA-DG NPs may serve as a MRI-targeted tumor agent for better tumor 
imaging.

PURPOSE: Neurogenic bladder-sphincter dysfunction (NBSD) constitutes the major
reason for morbidity in children with spina bifida. The aim of this study was to 
identify risk factors for renal damage in children with NBSD followed according
to the Swedish national guidelines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records and cystometries from 6 to 16 years (median 11)
follow up of 41 consecutive children born 1993-2003 with NBSD were evaluated. The
children were divided into a high pressure group (baseline pressure above 30
cmH(2)O at maximal clean intermittent catheterization volume in at least two
cystometries) and a low pressure group. Most children (34/41) were followed from 
birth.
RESULTS: Although renal scarring on DMSA-scintigraphy was found in 5/41 children,
all but one had normal renal function. Two already had renal scars on entering
the follow-up program at age 2.5 and 3 years. Renal scarring was more frequent in
the high pressure group (P < 0.01). Most children with renal scars (4/5) had a
combination of low compliant bladder and insufficient compliance with treatment
and follow up.
CONCLUSION: High baseline pressure is confirmed as a risk factor that, in
combination with complex social issues, creates a demanding situation for
families and professionals. A structured early follow up with treatment
compliance effectively prevents renal damage.

AIM: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by extended-spectrum beta lactamase
(ESBL)-producing bacteria have become a growing problem worldwide. The aim of
this study was to investigate the clinical and radiological findings in patients 
with community-acquired UTIs owing to ESBL-producing bacteria.
METHODS: Files of the patients that had UTI owing to ESBL-producing bacteria,
between January 2008 and December 2009, were retrospectively evaluated.
RESULTS: One hundred and eleven UTI episodes in 94 patients were included.
Seventy-five per cent of the patients had recurrent UTIs. Ultrasound,
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG)
were found abnormal in 36%, 46% and 31% of the patients, respectively. Overall,
68% of the patients had ≥1 underlying predisposing factor for UTI. Male patients 
and acute pyelonephritis (APN) episodes were more frequent at small ages. The
rate of female patients and cystitis episodes predominated with increasing age.
Ultrasound, DMSA scintigraphy, VSUG and UT abnormalities were more frequent in
patients with APN, and lower UT disturbances were more frequent in patients with 
cystitis.
CONCLUSION: UTIs owing to ESBL-producing bacteria begin to replace UTIs owing to 
non-ESBL-producing bacteria. However, the clinical pattern of these infections
does not seem to be different. Thus, our aim should be to correct underlying
predisposing factors in general in order to prevent infections owing to
ESBL-producing bacteria.

Novel techniques and newer markers for the evaluation of "proximal tubular
dysfunction".

Bonn, Bonn, Germany.

Renal Fanconi syndromes are both clinically challenging and physiologically
fascinating. The diagnosis requires a certain index of suspicion to correctly
identify the clinical symptomatology and pursue the appropriate laboratory
evaluations. The renal Fanconi syndrome (FS) is a defect of proximal tubular
function attributable to different rare inherited diseases or acquired disorders 
caused by a multitude of exogenous agents. It can manifest as complete or
incomplete FS, characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, glucosuria,
aminoaciduria, and loss of electrolytes, bicarbonate and lactate. Implementation 
of new methods and recent findings from urinary proteome pattern in patients with
renal FS has led to the identification of new markers for proximal tubular
dysfunction. Future combined proteomic and metabonomic studies will provide
additional potential biomarkers and may help to gain novel insights in the
diagnosis and differentiation of the various forms of FS. Moreover, the
observation of poor renal uptake of 99 mTc-DMSA in patients with tubular
proteinuria, which is not fully understood yet, may also help to elucidate the
individual basis of FS in early stages. This review focuses on the new advances
in the evaluation of proximal tubular dysfunction in various forms of Fanconi
syndrome.

The fixed charge zwitterionic sulfur betaines dimethylsulfonioacetate (DMSA)
(CH(3))(2)S(+)CH(2)CO(2)(-) and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP)
(CH(3))(2)S(+)(CH(2))(2)CO(2)(-) have been synthesized and the structures of
their protonated salts (CH(3))(2)S(+)CH(2)CO(2)H···Cl(-) [DMSA.HCl] and
(CH(3))(2)S(+)(CH(2))(2)CO(2)H···Pcr(-) [DMSP.HPcr] (where Pcr = picrate) have
been characterized using X-ray crystallography. The unimolecular chemistry of the
[M+H](+) of these betaines was studied using two techniques; collision-induced
dissociation (CID) and electron-induced dissociation (EID) in a hybrid linear ion
trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. Results from
the CID study show a richer series of fragmentation reactions for the shorter
chain betaine and contrasting main fragmentation pathways. Thus while
(CH(3))(2)S(+)(CH(2))(2)CO(2)H fragments via a neighbouring group reaction to
generate (CH(3))(2)S(+)H and the neutral lactone as the most abundant
fragmentation channel, (CH(3))(2)S(+)CH(2)CO(2)H fragments via a 1,2 elimination 
reaction to generate CH(3)S(+)=CH(2) as the most abundant fragment ion. To gain
insights into these fragmentation reactions, DFT calculations were carried out at
the B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,p) level of theory. For (CH(3))(2)S(+)CH(2)CO(2)H, the
lowest energy pathway yields CH(3)S(+)=CH(2)via a six-membered transition state. 
The two fragment ions observed in CID of (CH(3))(2)S(+)(CH(2))(2)CO(2)H are shown
to share the same transition state and ion-molecule complex forming either
(CH(3))(2)S(+)H or (CH(2))(2)CO(2)H(+). Finally, EID shows a rich and relatively 
similar fragmentation channels for both protonated betaines, with radical
cleavages being observed, including loss of ˙CH(3).

Correct assembly of iron-sulfur cluster FS0 into Escherichia coli dimethyl
sulfoxide reductase (DmsABC) is a prerequisite for molybdenum cofactor insertion.

The FS0 [4Fe-4S] cluster of the catalytic subunit (DmsA) of Escherichia coli
dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DmsABC) plays a key role in the electron transfer
relay. We have now established an additional role for the cluster in directing
molybdenum cofactor assembly during enzyme maturation. EPR spectroscopy indicates
that FS0 has a high spin ground state (S = 3/2) in its reduced form, resulting in
an EPR spectrum with a peak at g ∼ 5.0. The cluster is predicted to be in close
proximity to the molybdo-bis(pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide) (Mo-bisPGD)
cofactor, which provides the site of dimethyl sulfoxide reduction. Comparison
with nitrate reductase A (NarGHI) indicates that a sequence of residues
((18)CTVNC(22)) plays a role in both FS0 and Mo-bisPGD coordination. A DmsA(ΔN21)
mutant prevented Mo-bisPGD binding and resulted in a degenerate [3Fe-4S] cluster 
form of FS0 being assembled. DmsA belongs to the Type II subclass of
Mo-bisPGD-containing catalytic subunits that is distinguished from the Type I
subclass by having three rather than two residues between the first two Cys
residues coordinating FS0 and a conserved Arg residue rather than a Lys residue
following the fourth cluster coordinating Cys. We introduced a Type I Cys group
into DmsA in two stages. We changed its sequence from (18)C(A)TVNC(B)GSRC(C)P(27)
to (18)C(A)TYC(B)GVGC(C)G(26) (similar to that of formate dehydrogenase (FdnG))
and demonstrated that this eliminated both Mo-bisPGD binding and EPR-detectable
FS0. We then combined this change with a DmsA(R61K) mutation and demonstrated
that this additional change partially rescued Mo-bisPGD insertion.

Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe-NP) are currently considered for various
diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the brain. However, little is known on
the accumulation and biocompatibility of such particles in brain cells. We have
synthesized and characterized dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) coated Fe-NP and
have investigated their uptake by cultured brain astrocytes. DMSA-coated Fe-NP
that were dispersed in physiological medium had an average hydrodynamic diameter 
of about 60 nm. Incubation of cultured astrocytes with these Fe-NP caused a time-
and concentration-dependent accumulation of cellular iron, but did not lead
within 6 h to any cell toxicity. After 4 h of incubation with 100-4000 µM iron
supplied as Fe-NP, the cellular iron content reached levels between 200 and 2000 
nmol mg⁻¹ protein. The cellular iron content after exposure of astrocytes to
Fe-NP at 4 °C was drastically lowered compared to cells that had been incubated
at 37 °C. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of Fe-NP-containing vesicles 
in cells that were incubated with Fe-NP at 37 °C, but not in cells exposed to the
nanoparticles at 4 °C. These data demonstrate that cultured astrocytes
efficiently take up DMSA-coated Fe-NP in a process that appears to be saturable
and strongly depends on the incubation temperature.

This study aimed to identify noninvasive biomarkers of clinically significant
nephrouropathies in patients with antenatal renal and/or urinary tract
alterations. Spot-urine levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth
factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured in 100
patients with antenatal detected nephrouropathies. Patients were divided in
idiopathic hydronephrosis (n = 47), urinary tract malformations (n  = 35), and
dysplastic kidneys (n = 18). Urinary concentrations of TGF-β1, IL-6, and TNF-α
were compared between groups according to clinical and image findings.
Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed for the overall
diagnostic accuracy of TGF-β1, IL-6, and TNF-α levels in discriminating infants
with nephrouropathies. No significant differences in urinary TGF- β1, IL-6, and
TNF-α levels were found in the comparison between the groups. TGF-β1 levels
tended to be higher in patients with renal hypodysplasia compared to idiopathic
hydronephrosis (p = 0.07). Twenty-nine patients had reduced DMSA uptake. In these
cases, absolute urinary concentration of TGF-β1 and levels standardized for
creatinine were significantly higher than in patients with normal DMSA uptake,
while IL6 and TNF-α did not differ between groups. Urinary cytokine measurements 
were not useful as a screening test for clinically significant nephrouropathies. 
Conversely, increased concentrations of TGF-β1 pointed out to renal damage as
indicated by reduced DMSA uptake.

By linking the mercapto groups with isopropyl and introducing L-amino acid into
the 5-carboxyl of DMSA a class of novel 5-(1-carbonyl-L-amino-acid)-2,2-
dimethyl-[1,3]dithiolane-4-carboxylic acids were prepared. Their in vivo
activities were evaluated on lead loaded mice at the dose of 0.4 mmol/kg. The
results showed that the lead levels of the livers, kidneys, femurs and brains in 
particular could be efficiently decreased by 0.4 mmol/kg of
5-(1-carbonyl-L-amino-acid)-2,2-dimethyl-[1,3]dithiolane-4-carboxylic acids. The 
benefit of 5-(1-carbonyl-L-amino-acid)-2,2-dimethyl-[1,3]dithiolane-4-carboxylic 
acids to the detoxification of the brain lead was attributed to their
transmembrane ability. Compared with the lead detoxification efficacy, they did
not affect the essential metals such as Fe, Cu, Zn, and Ca of the treated mice.
Silico molecular modeling predicted that
5-(1-carbonyl-L-amino-acid)-2,2-dimethyl-[1,3]dithiolane-4-carboxylic acids had
no hepatotoxicity.

We describe a facile approach to controllable assembly of monodisperse Fe(3)O(4) 
nanoparticles (NPs) on chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO). First, reduction 
and functionalization of GO by polyetheylenimine (PEI) were achieved
simultaneously by simply heating the PEI and GO mixture at 60 °C for 12 h. The
process is environmentally friendly and convenient compared with previously
reported methods. Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinnic acid (DMSA)-modified Fe(3)O(4) NPs
were then conjugated to the PEI moiety which is located on the periphery of the
GO sheets via formation of amide bonds between COOH groups of DMSA molecules
bound on the surface of the Fe(3)O(4) NPs and amine groups of PEI. The magnetic
GO composites were characterized by means of TEM, AFM, UV-vis, FTIR, Raman, TGA, 
and VSM measurements. Finally, preliminary results of using the Fe(3)O(4)-rGO
composites for efficient removal of tetracycline, an antibiotic that is often
found as a contaminant in the environment, are reported.

In this study, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was combined with the genetic
detection of six genetic markers, ansB, dmsA, ggt, cj1585c, cjj81176-1367/71
(cj1365c), and the two-gene marker tlp7 (cj0951c plus cj0952c), to assess if
their presence correlated with different C. jejuni clonal groups. Using a
collection of 266 C. jejuni isolates from (in decreasing order of sample size)
humans, chickens, cattle, and turkeys, it was further investigated whether the
resulting genotypes correlated with the isolation source. We found combinations
of the six marker genes to be mutually exclusive, and their patterns of presence 
or absence correlated to some degree with animal source. Together with MLST
results, the obtained genotypes could be segregated into six groups. An
association was identified for ansB, dmsA, and ggt with the MLST-clonal complexes
(MLST-CC) 22, 42, 45, and 283, which formed the most prominent group, in which
chickens were the most prevalent animal source. Two other groups, characterized
by the presence of cj1585c, cjj81176-1367/71, and the two-gene marker tlp7,
associated with either MLST-CC 21 or 61, were overrepresented in isolates of
bovine origin. Mutually exclusive marker gene combinations were observed for
ansB, dmsA, and ggt, typically found in CC 45 and the related CC 22, 42, and 283,
whereas the other three marker genes were found mostly in CC 21, 48, and 206. The
presence of the two-gene marker tlp7, which is typical for MLST 21 and 53 as well
as for MLST-CC 61, strongly correlates with a bovine host; this is interpreted as
an example of host adaptation. In cases of C. jejuni outbreaks, these genetic
markers could be helpful for more effective source tracking.

As radio- and chemotherapy-based cancer treatments affect both tumors and healthy
tissue, cancer immunotherapy attempts to specifically enhance the natural immune 
response to tumor cells. In mouse models of cancer, we tested uniform
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)-coated monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles as a
delivery system for the anti-tumorigenic cytokine IFN-γ. IFN-γ-adsorbed
DMSA-coated magnetic nanoparticles were targeted to the tumor site by application
of an external magnetic field. We analyzed nanoparticle biodistribution before
and after IFN-γ conjugation, as well as the efficiency of nanoparticle
accumulation in tumors, IFN-γ release in the area of interest, and the effects of
both on tumor development. At the tumor site, we observed a high degree of
nanoparticle accumulation and of cytokine delivery, which led to increased T cell
and macrophage infiltration and promoted an anti-angiogenic effect. The combined 
action led to a notable reduction in tumor size. Our findings indicate that
IFN-γ-adsorbed DMSA-coated magnetite nanoparticles can be used as an efficient in
vivo drug delivery system for tumor immunotherapy.

Evaluation of kidney repair capacity using 99mTc-DMSA in ischemia/reperfusion
injury models.

University, Daegu 700-422, Republic of Korea.

Quantitative (99m)Tc-DMSA renal uptake was studied in different renal
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) mice models for the assessment of renal repair
capacity. Mice models of nephrectomy, uni- and bi-lateral I/R together with
sham-operated mice were established. At 1h, 1d, 4d, 1, 2 and 3 wk after I/R,
(99m)Tc-DMSA (27.7 ± 1.3 MBq) was injected via tail vein and after 3h
post-injection, the mice were scanned for 30 min with pinhole equipped gamma
camera. Higher uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA was measured in normal kidneys of
uni-lateral I/R model and nephrectomized kidney I/R model at 3 wk post-surgery.
Comparing the restoration capacities of the affected kidneys of nephrectomy, uni-
and bi-lateral I/R models, higher repair capacity was observed in the
nephrectomized model followed by bi-lateral then uni-lateral models. The normal
kidney may retard the restoration of damaged kidney in uni-lateral I/R model.
Moreover, 3 wk after Uni-I/R, the size of injured kidney was significantly
smaller than non-ischemic contralateral and sham operated kidneys, while
nephrectomy I/R kidneys were significantly enlarged compared to all others at 3
wk post-surgery. Very strong correlation between (99m)Tc-DMSA uptake and weight
of dissected kidneys in I/R models was observed. Consistent with (99m)Tc-DMSA
uptake results, all histological results indicate that kidney recovery after
injury is correlated with the amount of intact tubules and kidney sizes. In
summary, our study showed good potentials of (99m)Tc-DMSA scan as a promising
non-invasive method for evaluation of kidney restoration after I/R injuries.
Interestingly, mice with Bi-I/R injury showed faster repair capacity than those
with uni-I/R.

Procalcitonin: a key marker in children with urinary tract infection.

Leroy S(1), Gervaix A.

Author information: 
(1)Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Wolfson College Annexe, University of
Oxford, Linton Road, Oxford OX2 6UD, UK.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common source of bacterial
infections among young febrile children. Accurate diagnosis of acute
pyelonephritis (APN) and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is important because of
their association with renal scarring, leading in the cases to long-term
complications. However, the gold standard examinations for both are either DMSA
scan (for APN and scar) or cystography (for VUR) and present limitations
(feasibility, pain, cost, etc.). Procalcitonin, a reliable marker of bacterial
infections, was demonstrated to be a good predictor of both renal parenchymal
involvement in the acute phase and late renal scars. Furthermore, it was also
found to be associated with high-grade VUR and was the key tool of a clinical
decision rule to predict high-grade VUR in children with a first UTI. Therefore, 
procalcitonin may certainly be found playing a role in the complex and still
debated picture of which examination should be performed after UTI in children.

Spectroscopic study of maghemite nanoparticles surface-grafted with DMSA.

Author information: 
(1)Instituto de Física, Universidade de Brasília, Brasília DF, Brazil.

Nanosized maghemite (below 10 nm average diameter), surface-functionalized with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), was investigated with respect to the
content of DMSA molecules attached onto its surface and the onset of S-S bridges 
due to oxidation of neighboring S-H groups. To support our investigation, we
introduced the use of photoacoustic spectroscopy to monitor thiol groups (S-H)
conjugated with Raman spectroscopy to monitor the disulfide bridges (S-S). The
normalized intensity (N(R)) of the Raman feature peaking at 500 cm(-1) was used
to probe the S-S bridge whereas the normalized intensity (N(P)) of the
photoacoustic band-S (0.42-0.65 μm) was used to probe the S-H moiety. The perfect
linearity observed in the N(R) versus (1 - N(P)) plot strongly supports the
oxidation process involving neighboring S-H groups as the DMSA surface grafting
coefficient increases whereas the approach used in this report allows the
evaluation of the [S-H]/[S-S] ratio. The observation of the reduction of the
hydrodynamic diameter as the nominal DMSA-grafting increases supports the
proposed model picture, in which the intraparticle (interparticle) S-S bridging
takes place at higher (lower) DMSA-grafting values.

Sibling vesicoureteral reflux in twins.

Giannotti G(1), Menezes M, Hunziker M, Puri P.

Author information: 
(1)National Childrens Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.

AIM OF STUDY: Few studies have evaluated the incidence of familial vesicoureteral
reflux (VUR) among multiple gestation births. The purpose of this study was to
determine the incidence and characteristics of VUR in twins in a large cohort of 
families with VUR.
METHODS: Between 1998 and 2010, data were collected on 251 families (538
children) with at least 2 siblings who had VUR. The incidence of affected twins
among the families was analysed. Data were assessed for age at presentation,
gender, grading of VUR, laterality of affectation and renal scarring. VUR was
diagnosed by voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scans were used to assess renal scarring.
RESULTS: There were 12 families (4.8%) in which twins were affected with VUR.
There were 12 index cases (7 males/5 females), and 12 siblings (1 male/11
females). All index cases presented with urinary tract infection (UTIs), whereas 
2 siblings had UTIs and 10 were screened. All cases presented between 3 months
and 2 years. Among the index cases, three had unilateral and nine had bilateral
VUR. Among the siblings, four had unilateral and eight had bilateral VUR.
Thirty-seven (90%) of the 41 affected renal refluxing units had high-grade VUR.
Three index cases had renal scarring. No scarring was seen in the siblings.
CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of twins with VUR are females who have high grade 
VUR and a low incidence of renal scarring. Twins with VUR may represent a
genetically different subgroup with female preponderance and severe reflux.

OCRL mutations, which are a hallmark of Lowe syndrome, have recently been found
in patients with isolated renal phenotype (Dent-2 disease). In this report, we
describe clinical and laboratory features in five Macedonian children with
mutations in the OCRL gene. Children with a clinical diagnosis of Lowe syndrome
or Dent disease underwent complete neurological and ophthalmological examination,
imaging of the kidney and urinary tract, assessment of renal tubular function,
and mutation analysis of the OCRL gene. Two children (18 months and 11 years,
respectively) were diagnosed with Lowe syndrome on the basis of congenital
cataracts, severe psychomotor retardation, and renal dysfunction. Both children
had low molecular weight proteinuria (LMWP) and hypercalciuria, but not Fanconi
syndrome. The older one had bilateral nephrolithiasis due to associated
hypocitraturia and mild hyperoxaluria. Three children with asymptomatic
proteinuria were diagnosed with Dent-2 disease; none had cataracts or
neurological deficit. One child showed mild mental retardation. All had LMWP,
hypercalciuria, and elevated enzymes (creatine phosphokinase, lactic
dehydrogenase). All three children had an abnormal Tc-99m DMSA scan revealing
poor visualization of the kidneys with a high radionuclide content in the
bladder; none had nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. In conclusion, children
with OCRL mutations may present with very mild phenotype (asymptomatic
proteinuria with/without mild mental retardation) or severe classic
oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe. Elevated enzymes and abnormal results on the 
Tc-99m DMSA scan may be useful indicators for Dent-2 disease.

CONTEXT: While many cases of metallic mercury poisoning have been reported, cases
of metallic mercury poisoning from multiple exposure routes are rare.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 36-year-old Latin American male who
presented with rash, sore throat, fever, chills, cough, and diarrhea after
chronic mercury vapor exposure and likely intravenous injection. Despite
chelation treatment with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and
2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS), the patient's clinical course was
complicated by renal failure and he passed away after 18 days.
DISCUSSION: The most striking aspect of this case is that despite use of
chelators, a dramatic increase in blood mercury level occurred. We discuss the
rationale for combined use of chelators with hemodialysis and other treatments
such as plasma exchange in the setting of acute mercury poisoning. This case also
illustrated the potentially serious side effects of the chelation drug DMSA, and 
we discuss the potential relevance of dosing frequency to the occurrence rates of
such side effects.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Despite the tragic outcome, on review of case
literature, we believe this case provides valuable lessons concerning the use of 
DMSA and DMPS to treat mercury toxicity, particularly with regard to the combined
use of chelation agents and hemodialysis.

Prevention of chronic kidney disease in spina bifida.

OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children
and adults with spina bifida is considerable, rising, and entirely preventable.
REMOVING THE CAUSE: PREVENTION OF SPINA BIFIDA: The best prevention of CKD in
spina bifida is prevention of spina bifida itself through strategies that include
folate supplementation, ideally before pregnancy.
THE CAUSE OF CKD: Dysfunctional bladder outlet causes febrile Urinary Tract
Infections (UTI), even with clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), and
subsequent renal scarring. The development of secondary vesicoureteric reflux
(VUR) increases the risk of renal scarring and CKD.
FINDING THE IDEAL MARKER FOR MEASUREMENT OF RENAL FUNCTION IN SPINA BIFIDA:
Creatinine-based methods are insensitive because of low muscle mass and
underdeveloped musculature in the legs. Only Cystatin C-based eGFR can reliably
assess global renal function in these patients. However, unilateral renal damage 
requires nuclear medicine scans, such as (99m)Tc DMSA. (VIDEO)URODYNAMICS STUDIES
(UDS): Early treatment is recommended based on UDS with anticholinergics, CIC,
and antibiotic prophylaxis when indicated. Overnight catheter drainage, Botox,
and eventually augmentation cystoplasty are required for poorly compliant
bladders. A continent child or one rendered continent following surgery is at a
higher risk of renal damage.
CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary approach is required to reduce the burden of CKD 
in patients with spina bifida. The right tools have to be utilized to monitor
these patients, particularly if recurrent UTIs occur. Cystatin C eGFR is
preferred for monitoring renal damage in these patients, and (99m)Tc DMSA scans
have to be used to detect unilateral renal scarring.

Str. Campeni, 2-4, 400200 Cluj-Napoca, Romania. dianasorinafeier@yahoo.com

AIMS: The current study aims to assess the role of ultrasound (US) parameters in 
explaining the variance of hydronephrosis grades in reno-urinary anomalies, as
well as their performance in quantifying the incidence of patients with
uropathies.
METHODS: In this study 196 patients were prospectively included. All of them had 
renal/urinary tract anomalies and were recruited from 5992 US examined
hospitalized patients. Fifty patients were referred also to renal 99mTc- DMSA or 
99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy. The diagnostic performance of renal ultrasound and
scintigrafy parameters was assessed.
RESULTS: Pelvis antero-posterior diameter (APD) values were strongly correlated
with other investigated parameters. They correlated with measurements of US
parenchyma values (r=0.59, p=0.001), pelvis area (r=0.76, p=0.001) and with
scintigraphy long axis measurements (r=0.89, p=0.001). In multiple regression
analysis, the pelvis APD is the only independent predictor of high grades
hydronephrosis (p=0.001) and explained 62.4% of the variance of hydronephrosis
grades. The cut-off values for detection of significant hydronephrosis (grades
3,4) was 11 mm or more, and for detection of severe, in need of surgery,
hydronephrosis was 19 mm or more.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic performance of ultrasound was good, similar to those 
previously published by other authors. US detected pelvis APD is the main
predictor for high grades hydronephrosis but other parameters also influence the 
uropathy grades.

Case report: heavy metal burden presenting as Bartter syndrome.

Crinnion WJ(1), Tran JQ.

Author information: 
(1)Environmental Medicine Program, Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine,
Tempe, AZ, USA.

CONTEXT: Maternal transfer of heavy metals during fetal development or lactation 
possibly contributed to the clinical manifestations of Bartter syndrome and
developmental delay in the offspring.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 11-month-old child diagnosed with Bartter syndrome and
failure to thrive was treated concurrently for elevated metal burden while he was
undergoing standard medical interventions. Treatment with body-weight doses of
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) reduced the body burden of lead,
beryllium, copper, mercury, and cadmium at the three- and sixth-month follow-up
tests. During the course of the six-month treatment, the patient gained 2.4 kg
(5.2 lb) and grew approximately 9.5 cm (3.75 in). His weight shifted from
significantly below the 5th percentile in weight to within the 5th percentile,
and from below the 5th to within the 10th percentile for length.
DISCUSSION: The child's acquisition of lead, beryllium, and copper correspond to 
his mother's history of stained glass assembly and occurred during fetal
development or lactation, since there were no other identifiable sources that
could have contributed to the heavy metal burden. Tests for known genetic
mutations leading to Bartter syndrome were all negative.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This case report highlights the potential benefit
of DMSA for treatment of heavy metal body burden in infants who present with
Bartter syndrome.

[Should morphology of the upper pole in renal duplication with preserved function
and associated ureterocele be taken into account during treatment planning?].

[Article in Polish]

Medycznego w Szczecinie, ul. Unii Lubelskiej 1, 71-252 Szczecin.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess structural changes of the upper
pole in renal duplication with coexisting ureterocele with regard to primary
and/or secondary lesions. These changes might be of importance in treatment
planning.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The material of this study consisted of clinical
documentation and results of histopathology of 23 upper poles removed due to
renal duplication with coexisting ureterocele. The qualification criterion was
preserved function of the upper pole seen with 99mTc-DTPA (99mTechnetium
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid)/99mTc-DMSA (99mTechnetium dimercaptosuccinic 
acid). Resection of the upper pole was indicated in patients with recurrent
urinary tract infections and/or persistent vesicoureteral reflux to the lower
pole following endoscopic surgery of the ureterocele and/or low function of the
upper pole. Morphological lesions were classified as primary (dysplasia) or
secondary lesions. The patients were operated at the Department of Pediatric and 
Oncologic Surgery, PMU, in 1990-2008.
RESULTS: The study group consisted of 17 girls and 6 boys aged from 4 months to 9
years (mean 40 months). Recurrent urinary tract infections noted in 16 (70%)
children were the most frequent indication for surgery. The preoperative mean
function of the renal poles assessed with DTPA/DMSA represented 6% of the
differential renal function. Dysplasia was identified in eight resected renal
poles (34%) with coexisting secondary lesions in three of them. Secondary lesions
only were seen in 15 poles (66%). There was no correlation between age and
incidence of dysplasia during follow-up (Pearson's correlation coefficient r =
0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: Secondary lesions are a quite frequent finding in resected upper
poles. As 66% of the renal poles studied with histopathology revealed secondary
lesions only, we believe that renal sparing treatment is justified in cases of
urinary duplication with coexisting ureterocele.

INTRODUCTION: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its treatment may adversely 
affect kidney function. The aim of the present study was to determine whether
99mTc-DMSA static renal scintigraphy can be used to disclose kidney damage at the
end of therapy for ALL in children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 48 ALL patients aged 6.6-22.9 
years, with a mean time of continuous complete remission of 51 months. Static
renal scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA was performed in all patients.
RESULTS: Minor scars in the renal cortex were diagnosed with scintigraphy in 6
(13%) patients. A significant correlation was found between renal scarring and a 
history of urinary tract infection.
CONCLUSIONS: No clinically significant kidney damage was found after completion
of treatment of ALL. Static renal scintigraphy may be a valuable noninvasive
method for visualization of renal cortex pathology.

Author information: 
(1)Radiopharmaceutical Research and Development Lab (RRDL), Nuclear Science and
Technology Research Institute (NSTRI).

BACKGROUND AND THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Technetium-99m is the major radionuclide
used in the world and mainly is provided by fission product. However extensive
research has been conducted on the use of accelerators for production of (99m)Tc.
This investigation reports the production of (99m)Tc radioisotope using
cyclotrons and the preparation, quality control and biodistribution studies of
four major Tc-radiopharmaceuticals.
METHODS: The high purity molybdenum natural target (130 mg/cm(2)) was irradiated 
in a Cyclone 30 accelerator using 160 µA of 25 MeV proton beam energy for 1000
µA-h. After dissolution, the technetium radionuclides were extracted using methyl
ethyl ketone (MEK) followed by preparation of Tc-MIBI, Tc-DTPA, Tc-DMSA and
Tc-phytate as radiopharmaceutical samples.
RESULTS: The results of quality controls and animal biodistribution studies
showed successful production of Tc radionuclides (including (99m)Tc) in the
bombarded target and subsequent labelling of the kit with Tc.
CONCLUSION: The developed high power Mo target if constructed using enriched
(100)Mo, could be a practical method for large-scale production of (99m)Tc and
promising as an alternative to fission product (99)Mo-(99m)Tc generators for
local applications near cyclotron facilities.

Molecular imaging of neuroendocrine tumors.

Carrasquillo JA(1), Chen CC.

Author information: 
(1)Nuclear Medicine Service, Radiology Department Memorial Sloan-Kettering, New
York, NY, USA. carrasj1@mskcc.org

Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are a heterogeneous group of tumors that arise from
neuroendocrine cells. These tumors may arise from various organs, including lung,
thymus, thyroid, stomach, duodenum, small bowel, large bowel, appendix, pancreas,
adrenal, and skin. Most are well differentiated and have the ability to produce
biogenic amines and various hormones. NET usually occur sporadically but they
also be associated with various familial syndromes. For the vast majority of NET,
surgical resection is the treatment of choice whenever feasible. Localization of 
NET prior to surgery and for staging and follow-up relies on both anatomic and
functional imaging modalities. In fact, the unique secretory characteristics of
these tumors lend themselves to imaging by molecular imaging modalities, which
can target specific metabolic pathways or receptors. Neuroendocrine cells have a 
variety of such target receptors and pathways for which radiopharmaceuticals have
been developed, including [(123)I/(131)I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG),
[(111)In]pentetreotide, [(68)Ga] somatostatin analogs, [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG), [(11)C/(18)F] dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), [(11)C] 5-hydroxytryptophan
(5-HTP) (99m)Tc pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid ([(99m)Tc] (V) DMSA, and
[(18)F] fluorodopamine (FDA). Here, we review the molecular imaging approaches
for NET using various radiopharmaceuticals.

BACKGROUND: Cicatrisation of the renal cortex is closely related to chronic
infections of the urinary system. Static renal scintigraphy is used as the method
enabling detection of local defects of radiopharmaceutical uptake, and is treated
as the "gold standard" in the diagnosis of renal scars. The aim of the reported
investigation was a comparison of the diagnostic efficacy of parametric clearance
images and the conventional summation images - obtained from dynamic scintigraphy
- in the detection of local defects of renal function. As the "gold standard" for
the above comparison, the static scintigraphy of kidneys was accepted.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-one patients (age 4-19 years), 28 girls and 13 boys, 
participated in the study. Altogether, 73 kidneys were analyzed (in 9 patients,
only one kidney). In each patient dynamic renal scintigraphy was performed after 
IV administration of 99mTc EC (ethylenedicysteine) and static planar renal
scintigraphy using 99mTc-DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) as a reference method.
From the dynamic study, summation and parametric clearance images were generated.
Each kidney was divided into 3 segments (upper, middle, lower); altogether 219
segments were evaluated by modified Howard's scale. Planar and oblique projection
images were compared with corresponding summation and parametric clearance
images.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Parametric clearance imaging has a higher sensitivity
and accuracy for detection of regional post-inflammatory changes in the kidneys
than conventional summation images (p < 0.05) and shows parenchymal changes
similarly to static scintigraphy (high Cohen's kappa index).

Significance of Postnatal Follow-up of Infants with Vesicoureteral Reflux Having 
Antenatal Hydronephrosis.

Kangin M(1), Aksu N, Yavascan O, Anil M, Kara OD, Bal A, Kamit F.

Author information: 
(1)Diyarbakir National Hospital, Diyarbakir, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and
degree of renal parenchymal damage as well as the parameters of growth,
development and nutritional status in antenatal hydronephrosis cases with
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
METHODS: Infants, whose antenatal ultrasonography (US) showed a fetal renal
pelvic diameter of 5 mm or greater were investigated. Of the 277 infants with
antenatal HN, 36 [56 renal units (RUs)] were diagnosed with VUR. All cases with
VUR were evaluated in terms of the frequency of UTIs, scars appearing on
(99m)Technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA), growth and development
[height and weight standard deviation scores (HSDS and WSDS)], and nutritional
status [relative weight (RW)]. Statistical evaluation was performed using the
Chi-squared test.
FINDINGS: Of these 36 patients with VUR, 25 (69.4%) were males and 11 (30.6%)
females. Of the 56 RUs, 48 (85.7%) had severe VUR (≥ Grade III). The mean
duration of postnatal follow-up was 37.8±24.50 months. The annual UTI frequency
was found to be 1.25±0.83 episodes/year. Of these 36 infants, 32 (88.8%)
recovered from VUR following either medical (17 patients, 47.2%) or surgical (15 
patients, 41.6%) treatment. The initial DMSA showed parenchymal defects in 16
(44.4%) RUs, and 4 RUs showed recovery in the final DMSA. Although statistically 
insignificant (P>0.05), initial growth and development (HSDS: -0.17±0.86; WSDS:
0.00±0.14) and nutritional status (RW: 98.19±8.81) values gradually improved
(0.05±1.06, 0.06±1.071 and 101.97±14.85, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Postnatal early diagnosis and appropriate management of VUR in
infants with antenatal hydronephrosis can prevent the occurrence of frequent
UTIs, renal scarring and malnutrition, enabling normal growth and development.

Lead (Pb) toxicity is one of the commonest environmental problems in our life; it
causes many reversible and irreversible changes in our tissues. This study was
carried out to investigate the effect of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) 
on treatment of oxidative stress caused by lead poisoning in rabbits. Lead
acetate (Pb(Ac)(2)) was orally administrated to rabbits for 21 days and then
treated by DMSA for another 21 days. The effect of this treatment was
investigated by measuring 2 of the apoptosis proteins p53 and Bcl2. Also, the
auto-oxidation rate and their histopathological changes in brain, bone and liver 
were investigated. Hemoglobin auto-oxidation rate is measured as well as
histopathological study of liver. Our data indicate that exposure to rabbits to
Pb(Ac)(2) caused a significant increase of apoptosis protein p53 and decrease in 
the antiapoptotic BCl2 proteins.

[Imaging of urinary tract infection in children].

[Article in French]

Avni FE(1), Cassart M.

Author information: 
(1)Service d'Imagerie Médicale, Hôpital Erasme, Bruxelles. favni@ulb.ac.be

Urinary tract infection is very common in children. Its diagnosis, management and
treatment have led to abundant literature and many controversies. The main
challenges are to identify patients at risk of infection and those at risk of
complicated infections. Long-term complications include reflux nephropathy, renal
hypertension and stage renal disease. Imaging has a triple role: to confirm the
diagnosis in patients with equivocal clinical symptoms; to determine patients at 
risk of recurrence; prevention of infection by detecting already in utero
patients with congenital malformation. During the acute phase, Ultrasound has an 
important role in detecting favouring conditions such as urinary tract
dilatation. The use of color Doppler increases the sensibility and specificity of
ultrasound. To date, DMSA scan is the key examination for demonstrating the
parenchymal lesions. CT-scan and MRI are rarely used in this acute phase.
Retrograde voiding cystography (RVC) will be used whenever vesico-ureteric reflux
is suspected. A decision algorithm can be proposed bases on US and DMSA; RVC will
be performed whenever one of them is positive. CT or MRI will be used to look for
abscesses complicating the UTI. DMSA scan is the gold standard for detecting
renal scanning, sequellae of the infection. In the future, the role of MRI will
surely increase for the demonstration of uropathy acute and sequelae of the renal
involvement.

OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in
children has been the subject of debate for many years. Diagnosis of acute
pyelonephritis (APN) is usually based on clinical and biological data. The
clinical usefulness of early Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy remains controversial,
although it may influence the type and duration of treatment. The aim of this
study was to assess the role of initial cortical scintigraphy in the detection of
early renal parenchymal damage in children highly suspected of having APN and to 
compare the scintigraphic findings with selected clinical/laboratory parameters
and ultrasonography.
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in 34 infants and young children (18
boys, 16 girls), aged 1.5-36 months (mean 9.8 ± 8.7 months), hospitalized with a 
first episode of clinically suspected APN. Within the first 5 days after
admission, Tc-99m DMSA renal scintigraphy, ultrasonography (US), erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC) 
and urine analyses were performed.
RESULTS: DMSA scintigraphy showed changes consistent with APN in 27/34 (79%)
patients, with a mean age of 10.9 months, including 12 males (44%) and 15 (56%)
females. Out of 9 febrile children with negative urine culture and supportive
evidence of UTI, scintigraphy showed parenchymal involvement in 8 children (24%
in the whole group, 30% in scintigraphically documented APN). There were no
statistically significant correlations between the frequency or size of the
initial scintigraphic abnormalities and age, sex, body temperature, CRP levels or
ESR. A CRP level of >54 mg/L and a WBC of >13,300/mm³ had sensitivities of 56 and
59% and specificities of 86 and 71%, respectively. US showed changes consistent
with APN in 7/34 (21%) in the whole group and in 7/27 (26%) patients with
positive cortical scan (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Initial DMSA renal scintigraphy is a sensitive method for the early
diagnosis of APN in young children and is useful in the assessment of the
severity of kidney injury even in patients with negative urine culture. Clinical,
biological and ultrasound parameters do not identify children with renal damage. 
Normal DMSA study, excluding parenchymal involvement and late sequelae, could
minimize the use of scintigraphy in the follow-up and reduce the redundancy of
cystography.

High kidney radiation doses during clinical peptide receptor radionuclide therapy
(PRRT) with β-particle-emitting radiolabeled somatostatin analogs will lead to
renal failure several months after treatment, urging the coinfusion of the
cationic amino acids lysine and arginine to reduce the renal radiation dose. In
rat PRRT studies, renal protection by the coadministration of lysine was
confirmed by histologic examination of kidney specimens indicating
nephrotoxicity. In the current study, we investigated dedicated small-animal
SPECT/CT renal imaging in rats to monitor renal function in vivo during follow-up
of PRRT, with and without lysine.METHODS: The following 3 groups of rats were
imaged using a multipinhole SPECT/CT camera: controls (group 1) and rats at more 
than 90 d after therapy with 460 MBq (15 μg) of (177)Lu-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate
without (group 2) or with (group 3) a 400-mg/kg lysine coinjection as kidney
protection (n ≥ 6 per group). At 90 and 140 d after therapy, static kidney
scintigraphy was performed at 2 h after injection of 25 MBq of
(99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA). In addition, dynamic dual-isotope
renography was performed using 50 MBq of (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid ((111)In-DTPA) and 50 MBq of (99m)Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine ((99m)Tc-MAG3)
at 100-120 d after therapy.
RESULTS: (111)In-DTPA and (99m)Tc-MAG3 studies revealed a time-activity pattern
comparable to those in patients, with a peak at 2-6 min followed by a decline of 
renal radioactivity. Reduced (111)In-DTPA, (99m)Tc-MAG3, and (99m)Tc-DMSA uptake 
indicated renal damage in group 2, whereas group 3 showed only a decrease of
(99m)Tc-MAG3 peak activity. These results indicating nephrotoxicity in group 2
and renal protection in group 3 correlated with levels of urinary protein and
serum creatinine and urea and were confirmed by renal histology.
CONCLUSION: Quantitative dynamic dual-isotope imaging using both (111)In-DTPA and
(99m)Tc-MAG3 and static (99m)Tc-DMSA imaging in rats is feasible using
small-animal SPECT, enabling longitudinal monitoring of renal function.
(99m)Tc-MAG3 renography, especially, appears to be a more sensitive marker of
tubular function after PRRT than serum chemistry or (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy.

OBJECTIVE: We assessed the role and long-term outcome of upper pole
heminephroureterectomy in the treatments of non-functioning upper renal moieties 
in children with duplex kidneys.
METHODS: In a period of 10 years, forty-three patients (male: female ratio 6:37) 
underwent upper pole heminephroureterectomy; a total of 25 patients were
diagnosed prenatally. Imaging modalities included renal and bladder ultrasound in
all 43 patients, static 99 m technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in 21
patients, micturating cystourethrogram in 28 patients, MAG-3 in 13, cystoscopy in
30, IVU in 31 and DTPA, retrograde pyelography, antegrade pyelography in 1
patient. The main presentation was with urinary tract infections. Operation was
performed through a combination of anterolateral loin incision plus right or left
inguinal incision in 34 patients and high flank incision in 9 patients, for
various abnormalities. One patient underwent also initial puncture of a
ureterocele.
RESULTS: Five patients (12%) had immediate post-operative complications. Thirteen
patients (30%) had late post-operative complications. Long-term follow-up
revealed no complication in 35 (81%) patients and one (2%) patient had one
episode of UTI and intermittent abdominal pain. Three patients (7%) had long-term
incontinence. Four patients (9%) had a second procedure performed.
CONCLUSION: Based on our experience, it seems that upper pole
heminephroureterectomy is the treatment of choice in cases of obstructed upper
segments of duplicated kidneys, when the affected segment contributes to less
than 10% of the overall renal function.

BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, the risk of renal scarring in children with a
urinary tract infection (UTI) has not been systematically studied.
OBJECTIVE: To review the prevalence of acute and chronic renal imaging
abnormalities in children after an initial UTI.
METHODS: We searched Medline and Embase for English-, French-, and
Spanish-language articles using the following terms: "Technetium (99m)Tc
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)," "DMSA," "dimercaptosuccinic," "scintigra*,"
"pyelonephritis," and "urinary tract infection." We included articles if they
reported data on the prevalence of abnormalities on acute-phase (≤15 days) or
follow-up (>5 months) DMSA renal scans in children aged 0 to 18 years after an
initial UTI. Two evaluators independently reviewed data from each article.
RESULTS: Of 1533 articles found by the search strategy, 325 full-text articles
were reviewed; 33 studies met all inclusion criteria. Among children with an
initial episode of UTI, 57% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 50-64) had changes
consistent with acute pyelonephritis on the acute-phase DMSA renal scan and 15%
(95% CI: 11-18) had evidence of renal scarring on the follow-up DMSA scan.
Children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) were significantly more likely to
develop pyelonephritis (relative risk [RR]: 1.5 [95% CI: 1.1-1.9]) and renal
scarring (RR: 2.6 [95% CI: 1.7-3.9]) compared with children with no VUR. Children
with VUR grades III or higher were more likely to develop scarring than children 
with lower grades of VUR (RR: 2.1 [95% CI: 1.4-3.2]).
CONCLUSIONS: The pooled prevalence values provided from this study provide a
basis for an evidence-based approach to the management of children with this
frequently occurring condition.

Manufacture of IRDye800CW-coupled Fe3O4 nanoparticles and their applications in
cell labeling and in vivo imaging.

China. wangjinke@seu.edu.cn.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)-labeled iron
nanoparticles have been synthesized and applied in a number of applications,
including the labeling of human cells for monitoring the engraftment process,
imaging tumors, sensoring the in vivo molecular environment surrounding
nanoparticles and tracing their in vivo biodistribution. These studies
demonstrate that NIRF-labeled iron nanoparticles provide an efficient probe for
cell labeling. Furthermore, the in vivo imaging studies show excellent
performance of the NIR fluorophores. However, there is a limited selection of
NIRF-labeled iron nanoparticles with an optimal wavelength for imaging around 800
nm, where tissue autofluorescence is minimal. Therefore, it is necessary to
develop additional alternative NIRF-labeled iron nanoparticles for application in
this area.
RESULTS: This study manufactured 12-nm DMSA-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles labeled
with a near-infrared fluorophore, IRDye800CW (excitation/emission, 774/789 nm),
to investigate their applicability in cell labeling and in vivo imaging. The
mouse macrophage RAW264.7 was labeled with IRDye800CW-labeled Fe3O4 nanoparticles
at concentrations of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80 and 100 μg/ml for 24 h. The results
revealed that the cells were efficiently labeled by the nanoparticles, without
any significant effect on cell viability. The nanoparticles were injected into
the mouse via the tail vein, at dosages of 2 or 5 mg/kg body weight, and the
mouse was discontinuously imaged for 24 h. The results demonstrated that the
nanoparticles gradually accumulated in liver and kidney regions following
injection, reaching maximum concentrations at 6 h post-injection, following which
they were gradually removed from these regions. After tracing the nanoparticles
throughout the body it was revealed that they mainly distributed in three organs,
the liver, spleen and kidney. Real-time live-body imaging effectively reported
the dynamic process of the biodistribution and clearance of the nanoparticles in 
vivo.
CONCLUSION: IRDye800CW-labeled Fe3O4 nanoparticles provide an effective probe for
cell-labeling and in vivo imaging.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of
intrarenal reflux (IRR) regarding urinary tract infection (UTI), renal scarring
and spontaneous resolution after 3 years of follow up.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 33 patients (42 refluxing units) with IRR were compared to 
27 children (44 refluxing units) with high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)
without IRR (controls) matched for gender, age and VUR grade. All patients
received antibiotic prophylaxis during observation and antireflux surgery was
performed in children with recurrent UTI. DMSA scan was performed at study entry,
and 18 and 36 months.
RESULTS: DMSA scores at entry showed a higher proportion of moderate and severe
damage in the IRR group (25/42) compared to the control group (16/44) (Chi
squared, P < 0.03). During follow up the incidence of UTI was similar in the two 
groups, as well as the stability of DMSA scintigraphy and the rate of spontaneous
disappearance of the reflux. A similar proportion of patients underwent surgery
(18/33 patients with IRR and 13/27 control patients; Chi squared, not
significant).
CONCLUSIONS: Under medical management, the prognosis for IRR is not different
from high-grade VUR without IRR. The presence of IRR does not justify more
aggressive management than a high-grade VUR without IRR.

Open partial nephrectomy with no clamping of the pedicule: a good surgical option
in treatment of renal cancer.

Dente D(1), Paniccia T, Petrone D, Gaspari G, Tucci C, Rossetti R, Pompa P.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Policlinico Umberto I, Rome, Italy.

AIM: The aim of the present work was to describe authors' surgical experience
using the partial nephrectomy technique without intraoperatory pedicle clamping
for masses even up to 4 cm of size.
METHODS: The study enrolled 96 patients with an average age of 59.7 years, who
underwent partial nephrectomy without pedicle clamping. The average dimensions of
the masses treated were 3.7x3x3.8. In preoperative and in postoperative time
creatinine, hemoglobine, hematocrit and platelets were monitored. The follow-up
was of 1-3-6 months. At the third month postoperatively a renal US scan was
performed, together with a control CT scan and at the sixth month of follow-up
the patients underwent also a control Tc99/DMSA renal scintigraphy in back,
front, oblique and right posterior oblique left rear projections.
RESULTS: Surgery and anesthesia time have been respectively of 1 h 51 min e 2 h
30 min. In the postoperative time the average values were: creatinine 1.46 ng/mL 
(±0.45), hemoglobin: 11.25 g/dL (±1.6), hematocrit: 36.4 % (±3), platelets: 205 x
103 (±45 x 103). At follow-up at 1-3-6 months the average values were: creatinine
1.16 ng/dL (±0.66), hemoglobin 14.13 g/dL (±0.13), hematocrit 42.43% (±1.03),
platelets 204 x 103 U/L (±1.66 x103). After six months the renal function
demonstrated intraparenchymal homogeneous distribution of the drug in all the
patients, with a 7% of difference of relative uptake by the operated kidney than 
the healthy controlateral one.
CONCLUSION: The partial nephrectomy without intraoperative pedicle clamping can
be a good therapeutic option for the treatment of kidney cancer for masses even
up to 4 cm of size. The follow-up should be longer to assess oncological results.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neonatology, The Children's Hospital Medical Center School of
Medicine Medical Sciences/University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.

AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and clinical course
of urinary tract infection (UTI) in neonates with septicemia and also determine
the most common UTI manifestations in hospitalized neonates.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on consecutive febrile infants
aged 1 to 56 days that were hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit. In 
all neonates with positive urine culture, scintigraphy with technetium-99m
-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and ultrasonography (US) were done.
Voiding cystourethrography was performed in the course of the illness, generally 
within 5-7 days of hospitalization.
RESULTS: Positive blood culture was detected only in 9% of patients. However, 5% 
of them had positive urine culture. Positive Abnormal US findings were present in
2 of 5 (40%) and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was present in 1 of 5 (20%) of
infants with positive urine culture.
CONCLUSION: DMSA scan revealed renal parenchymal abnormalities in 3 of 5 (60%)
neonates with urosepsis. The incidence of UTI in neonates with septicemia is low.
All neonates with sepsis and positive urine culture should undergo a screening
renal scintigraphy and cystogram for identifying renal parenchymal involvement
and urinary tract abnormalities.

Leukocyte transepithelial migration in lung induced by DMSA functionalized
magnetic nanoparticles.

Magnetic nanoparticles surface-covered with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(MNPs-DMSA) constitute a promising approach for tissue- and cell-targeted
delivery of therapeutic drugs in the lung. However, they can also induce a
transient transendothelial migration of leukocytes in the organ as a side effect 
after endovenous administration of MNPs-DMSA. We demonstrated that
monocytes/macrophages constitute the main subpopulation of leukocytes involved in
this process. Our recent research found that MNPs-DMSA up-regulated the mRNA
expression of E-, L- and P-selectin and macrophage-1 antigen, and increased
concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α in lung, in a time dependent manner. The
critical relevance of the β2 integrin-dependent pathway in leukocyte
transmigration elicited by MNPs-DMSA was demonstrated by use of knockout mice.
Our work characterizes mechanisms of the pro-inflammatory effects of MNPs-DMSA in
the lung, and identifies β2 integrin-targeted interventions as promising
strategies to reduce pulmonary side effects of MNPs-DMSA during biomedical
applications. In addition, MNPs-DMSA could be used as modulators of lung immune
response.

The purpose of this study was to investigate if ibuprofen intake can influence
mammary uptake of the proliferation-seeking radiotracer technetium
99m-pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-(V)DMSA) in women with severe
epithelial and atypical epithelial breast hyperplasia. Eight patients with
histologically confirmed severe epithelial breast hyperplasia with (n  =  4) and 
without atypia (n  =  4) were submitted prospectively to 99mTc-(V)DMSA
scintimammography before and after a 4-week course of 400 mg ibuprofen daily oral
intake. Lesion to background ratios 60 minutes postinjection were calculated and 
compared (t-test) before and after ibuprofen administration. Prior to ibuprofen, 
the patients with severe epithelial hyperplasia displayed a significantly higher 
99mTc-(V)DMSA uptake ratio compared to those with atypical epithelial hyperplasia
(2.40 ± 0.32 vs 1.67 ± 0.09, respectively; p  =  .003). They also exhibited a
more substantial percent decline in tracer uptake postibuprofen compared to women
with atypical epithelial hyperplasia (62.0 ± 7.1 vs 15.0 ± 0.2, respectively; p
 =  .001). Ibuprofen induces significant uptake reduction of the
proliferation-seeking radiotracer 99mTc-(V)DMSA in severe epithelial breast
hyperplasia without atypia. This agent could therefore constitute a potential
imaging tool for monitoring chemoprophylaxis effectiveness in women at the early 
stages of malignant transformation.

Animal studies suggest that administration of vitamin A to rats with experimental
urinary tract infection decreases the frequency of renal scars (Kavukçu et al.,
BJU Int 83(9):1055-1059, 1999). The aim of this study was to determine the effect
of vitamin A on the rate of permanent renal damage in children with acute
pyelonephritis. Fifty children, median age of 24 months (range 2-144), with
first-time pyelonephritis verified by an uptake defect on acute
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan were included in the study and randomly
allocated to the case or control groups. All were given intravenous ceftriaxone
for 10 days followed by oral cephalexin for 3 months. Cases in addition were
given a single intramuscular dose of vitamin A, 25,000 U for infants below 1 year
of age and 50,000 U for older children. At the repeat DMSA scan after 3 months,
five of 25 cases (20%) and 17 of 25 controls (68%) had abnormal findings
(p = 0.001). In conclusion, administration of vitamin A was associated with a
significantly lower rate of permanent renal damage.

INTRODUCTION. Urinary tract infection is the most common serious bacterial
infection in children. The aim of this study was to compare the value of
different laboratory and imaging techniques in detecting renal involvement in
acute pyelonephritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In a cross-sectional study of
patients 1 month to 14 years of age diagnosed with urinary tract infection were
examined with systemic inflammatory markers, renal ultrasonography, voiding
cystourethrography (VCUG), and technetium Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid
((99m)Tc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy. A total of 1467 pediatric patients were
eligible for treatment of pyelonephritis. Evaluations included a complete blood
count, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),
urinalysis, urine culture, and measurement of serum blood urea nitrogen and
creatinine levels. RESULTS. The results of (99m)Tc-DMSA scans were normal in
20.2%, mild decreased cortical uptake in 45.0%, moderate decreased cortical
uptake in 12.3%, severe decreased cortical uptake in 12.0%, and decreased
cortical function plus irregularity or scar formation in 10.5%. Voiding
cystourethrography showed vesicoureteral reflux in 25.9%. The sensitivity of
(99m)Tc-DMSA for prediction of vesicoureteral reflux was 84.1% with a negative
predictive value of 80.6%. Significant differences were found in the level of
blood leukocyte count (P = .03), urine leukocyte count (P = .003), ESR (P =
.008), and age (P = .04) between patients with normal and abnormal (99m)Tc-DMSA
scan results. CONCLUSIONS. We found that in patient with clinical signs of
pyelonephritis, (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy can detect pyelonephritis more
accurately than the other inflammatory and imaging tests.

Effects of selenite and chelating agents on mammalian thioredoxin reductase
inhibited by mercury: implications for treatment of mercury poisoning.

Pharmacy, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal. cristina.carvalho@ff.ul.pt

Mercury toxicity is a highly interesting topic in biomedicine due to the severe
endpoints and treatment limitations. Selenite serves as an antagonist of mercury 
toxicity, but the molecular mechanism of detoxification is not clear. Inhibition 
of the selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is a suggested mechanism of
toxicity. Here, we demonstrated enhanced inhibition of activity by inorganic and 
organic mercury compounds in NADPH-reduced TrxR, consistent with binding of
mercury also to the active site selenolthiol. On treatment with 5 μM selenite and
NADPH, TrxR inactivated by HgCl(2) displayed almost full recovery of activity.
Structural analysis indicated that mercury was complexed with TrxR, but
enzyme-generated selenide removed mercury as mercury selenide, regenerating the
active site selenocysteine and cysteine residues required for activity. The
antagonistic effects on TrxR inhibition were extended to endogenous antioxidants,
such as GSH, and clinically used exogenous chelating agents BAL, DMPS, DMSA, and 
α-lipoic acid. Consistent with the in vitro results, recovery of TrxR activity
and cell viability by selenite was observed in HgCl(2)-treated HEK 293 cells.
These results stress the role of TrxR as a target of mercurials and provide the
mechanism of selenite as a detoxification agent for mercury poisoning.

Determination of sulphate in water and biodiesel samples by a sequential
injection analysis--multivariate curve resolution method.

Chemistry and Organic Chemistry Department, Universitat Rovira i Virgili,
Marcel.li Domingo s/n, Campus Sescelades, 43007 Tarragona, Spain.

A spectrophotometric sequential injection analysis (SIA-DAD) method linked to
multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) has been
developed for sulphate determination. This method involves the reaction, inside
the tubes of the SIA system, of sulphate with barium-dimethylsulphonazo (III)
complex, Ba-DMSA (III), displacing Ba(2+) from the complex and forming DMSA
(III). When the reaction products reach the detector a data matrix is obtained,
which allows a second-order calibration to be developed. The experimental
conditions (concentration and sample and reagent volumes) to obtain the highest
sensitivity have been chosen applying a 2(4-1) fractional factorial design. The
proposed sequential flow procedure permits up to 15 mg SO(4)(2-) L(-1) to be
determined with a limit of detection of 1.42 mg L(-1) and it is able to monitor
sulphate in samples at a frequency of 15 samples per hour. The method was applied
to determine sulphate in natural and residual waters and in biodiesel. The
reliability of the method was established for water samples by parallel
determination using a standard turbidimetric method for sulphate in natural and
residual water samples with results within statistical variation. For biodiesel
samples, the method was validated comparing the concentration of some spiked

Bidentate chelation, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), was used as a
stabilizer for the synthesis of CdTe quantum dots (QDs). The bidentate chelate
QDs, characterized with FT-IR, PL, and UV/Vis spectroscopy; element analysis; and
high-resolution transmission electron microscope, exhibited surface traps due to 
the large surface/volume ratio of QD particle and the steric hindrance of the
DMSA molecule. The unpassivated surface of the QDs produced a narrower band gap
than the core and electrochemiluminescent (ECL) emission at relatively low
cathodic potential. In air-saturated pH 7.0 buffer, the QDs immobilized on
electrode surface showed an intense ECL emission peak at -0.85 V (vs. Ag/AgCl).
H(2)O(2) produced from electrochemical reduction of dissolved oxygen was
demonstrated to be the co-reactant, which avoided the need of strong oxidant as
the co-reactant and produced a sensitive analytical method for peroxidase-related
analytes. Using hydroquinone/horseradish peroxidase/H(2)O(2) as a model system, a
new, reagentless, phenolic, ECL biosensor for hydroquinone was constructed, based
on the quenching effect of ECL emission of QDs by consumption of co-reactant
H(2)O(2). The biosensor showed a linear range of 0.2-10 μM with acceptable
stability and reproducibility. This work opens new avenues in the search for new 
ECL emitters with excellent analytical performance and makes QDs a more
attractive alternative in biosensing.

Technetium-99m ((99m)Tc)–labeled pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid
([(99m)Tc]-(V)DMSA) has been used for renal scintigraphy (see below for
references) as well as detection and postoperative evaluation of medullary
carcinomas of the thyroid (MCT).[(99m)Tc]-(V)DMSA has been shown to accumulate in
breast tumors, head and neck cancers, osteosarcomas, and hepatocellular carcinoma
(1). [(99m)Tc]-(V)DMSA has been used for renal (2, 3) and metastatic tumor (4)
scintigraphy in animals (2), adults (4), and children (3). The (99m)Tc in
[(99m)Tc]-DMSA has been shown to exist in a trivalent (III) or a pentavalent (V) 
state, depending on the pH at which the radiolabeled compound was prepared.
[(99m)Tc]-(III)DMSA is used as a renal imaging agent, whereas [(99m)Tc]-(V)DMSA
is suitable for imaging cancerous tumors (5). Recently, the European Association 
of Nuclear Medicine revised its guidelines for the use of [(99m)Tc]-(V)DMSA
scintigraphy in children. Also, several clinical trials approved by the United
States Food and Drug Administration to evaluate the use of unlabeled DMSA for the
treatment of lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in children have been
completed. The exact mechanism of [(99m)Tc]-(V)DMSA uptake by the tumor cells is 
not clear, but a report suggests that cellular uptake of this radiotracer is
mediated by the sodium phosphate co-transporter type III (NaPi type III) (6). The
biodistribution of [(99m)Tc]-(V)DMSA has been studied in rabbits (7) and mice
(8). [(99m)Tc]-(V)DMSA uptake has also been used to the evaluate the efficacy of 
chemotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma (9) or glioblastoma (10) and to
investigate the correlation of breast cancer in women to breast density and
expression of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (11).

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the ability of acute
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy for revealing vesicoureteral reflux
(VUR) in young children after a first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: Children aged<or=24 months and were admitted with a first febrile UTI
during a 5-year period were evaluated. The ability of acute DMSA scintigraphy to 
reveal dilating (grades 3-5) or severe (grades 4-5) VUR was assessed by comparing
DMSA scan findings with those of voiding cystourethrography.
RESULTS: Of the 296 children included, 46 had dilating and 25 severe VUR.
Abnormal DMSA scan results were associated with an odds ratio of 4.36 for
dilating and 5.50 for severe VUR. For detecting dilating VUR, the area under the 
curve (AUC) was 0.68, the positive likelihood ratio (LR) was 2.00, and the
negative LR was 0.46; for severe VUR, those values were 0.69, 2.10, and 0.38,
respectively. Children with abnormal DMSA scan results combined with abnormal
ultrasonography had an odds ratio of 3.60 for dilating and 6.32 for severe VUR.
Despite normal findings on both investigations, 12 children had dilating and 4
severe VUR. For dilating VUR, the area under the (AUC) was 0.65, the positive LR 
was 1.70, and the negative LR was 0.47; for severe VUR, the values were 0.69,
1.90, and 0.29, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that acute DMSA scintigraphy has limited overall
ability in identifying VUR and should not be endorsed as replacement for voiding 
cystourethrography in the evaluation of young children with a first febrile UTI.

vesicoureteral reflux among young children with febrile urinary tract infection].

University, Shanghai 201102, China.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scanning in predicting vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) among young children with
febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) and to investigate the priority in applying
either micturating cystourethrography (MCU) or DMSA.
METHODS: The medical records of children (age < or = 2 years), presenting with
febrile UTI between January 2000 and December 2009, were retrospectively
reviewed. All cases underwent DMSA renal scan within 1 week after diagnosis and
MCU within 1 week after infection. According to the results of MCU, children were
divided into groups of non-VUR, low-grade and high-grade VUR.
RESULTS: A total of 370 children (233 boys, 137 girls) were included, of whom 263
(71.1%) had abnormal DMSA results and 126 (34.1%) were identified as VUR on MCU. 
Among children with VUR, the number of high-grade was 103 (81.7%). The rate of
abnormal results on DMSA of high-grade VUR group was significantly higher than
the rates of the other two groups (P < 0.01). The sensitivity of DMSA for
detecting high grade VUR was 99.0%. The negative predictive value was 99.1% and
negative likelihood ratio was 0.03, respectively.
CONCLUSION: High-grade VUR remains an important risk factor of renal damage for
young children with febrile UTI. The possibility to detect high-grade VUR on MCU 
is rather low when the result of DMSA is negative. It is recommended that DMSA be
used before MCU to investigate the febrile UTI children at acute phase, because
it would predict the majority of children with high-grade VUR while detecting
renal lesions.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of percutaneous
nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and tract dilatation methods on global and regional renal 
function using quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography (QSPECT)
of technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA).
METHODS: Seventy-five patients undergoing PCNL between May 2008 and April 2009
were included in this randomized study. Of the 75 patients, 50 were evaluated by 
QSPECT of (99m)Tc-DMSA examinations before and at 3 to 6 months after surgery.
This group of patients were categorized into three groups according to the
dilatation technique used: group I (balloon dilator, n = 12 [24%] patients),
group II (metal dilator, n = 14 [28%] patients), and group III (Amplatz dilator, 
n = 24 [48%] patients).
RESULTS: Of 50 renal units, new focal cortical defects on (99m)Tc-DMSA scan were 
seen in nine patients (18%). In six of these kidneys the site of focal defect
corresponded to the access site for tract formation during PCNL (two in group II 
and four in group III). Total relative uptake and total area of treated kidney,
for the entire group, increased from 42.2% and 42.3% preoperatively to 44.12% and
43.9% postoperatively. There was no statistically significant differences between
the groups for total uptake and area of the treated kidneys before and after the 
procedure (p > 0.05 for each parameter).
CONCLUSIONS: QSPECT of (99m)Tc-DMSA confirms that renal function is preserved or 
often improved after percutaneous stone removal, and nephrostomy tract dilatation
methods have similar effects on renal function.

AIM: Tc-99m DMSA renal cortical scan is a reference method for determining
relative renal function (RRF). Tc-99m MAG-3 is also recommended for the
estimation of RRF, particularly in young children. The aims of this study were to
compare MAG-3 and DMSA RRF estimations and to assess the reproducibility of these
estimations in children with unilateral hydronephrosis.
METHODS: We reviewed MAG-3 and DMSA scans of 19 children with unilateral
hydronephrosis and a normal contralateral unit. All were imaged with 2 agents
within 3 months. MAG-3 RRF was calculated using 2 different time intervals (1-2
and 2-3 min) and perirenal C-type region of background activity. No background
correction method was used in the calculation of DMSA RRF. All data were
processed twice by two independent operators.
RESULTS: In the repeated estimates of MAG-3 RRF, the maximum mean intra-observer 
and inter-observer differences were 0.9% (SD 1.7%) and 1.4% (SD 3.3%),
respectively. Intra-method analysis showed statistically significant agreement
between repeated measures of RRF for two agents as well as for two operators
(intra-class cross-correlation coefficients of early and later phase of MAG-3 and
DMSA RRF values were 0.979, 0.993 and 0.996 for operator 1, and 0.986, 0.973 and 
0.995 for operator 2, respectively; p < 0.001). There were statistically
significant correlations between the MAG-3 and DMSA RRF estimations (r =
0.763/0.766 at 1-2 min, 0.835/0.825 at 2-3 min for the repeated measures of RRF
for operator 1, and 0.812/0.793 and 0.83/0.89 for operator 2, respectively; p <
0.01, Pearson). Each scan classified as normal or abnormal according to RRF
values inter-method analysis showed statistically significant agreement between
MAG-3 and DMSA RRF estimations (Kappa statistics). However, there was a slight
disagreement between the methods especially in infants and cases with higher
grade of hydronephrosis, when 5% difference in estimations and supranormal
estimates of RRF were taken into consideration.
CONCLUSION: Although DMSA and MAG-3 RRF estimations demonstrated a statistically 
significant correlation with good reproducibility in children with unilateral
hydronephrosis, overall the finding of surprising estimates of kidney function
with MAG-3 calls attention to the existence of some problems especially in
infants and in those with higher grades of hydronephrotic kidneys.

High specific activity (188)Re required for nuclear medicine is mostly obtained
from (188)W/(188)Re generators. As the parent radionuclide (188)W is of low
specific activity (<185 GBq/g), a relatively large volume of 0.9% saline is
required for the elution of (188)Re. Post-elution concentration is needed in
order to increase the radioactive concentration of the eluted (188)Re. An
electrochemical procedure to concentrate (188)Re suitable for the preparation of 
radiopharmaceuticals is developed. (188)Re eluted from an alumina generator could
be concentrated approximately 100 fold, and it could be used to label DMSA and
HEDP with >98% yield.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in infants and children and may result 
in serious complications, such as renal scarring, hypertension, and renal
failure. Identification of the new markers in relation to acute pyelonephritis
(APN) and its treatment is essential for designing interventions that would
minimize tissue damage. This prospective study investigated the first UTI
infection in 71 children (age range: 1-24 months) in respect to interleukin-6
(IL-6) -174G/C polymorphism and renal scarring. The patients were divided into an
APN group and a lower UTI group according to dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The 
IL-6 -174G/C genotypes were determined by tetra-primer ARMSPCR. Serum IL-6 was
significantly higher in the APN group than in the group with lower UTI (p<0.05). 
In both groups, the -174G/C genotype and allele frequencies did not differ
significantly from the control group. The highest white blood cell (WBC) count
was observed in the CC genotype (p<0.05). A non-significant trend toward higher
serum IL-6 was observed in children with CC genotype. On follow-up DMSA imaging
performed 6 months later, renal scarring was detected in 36.9% of APN children.
We did not find the significant association of IL-6 -174G/C polymorphism with APN
and/or postinfectious renal scarring. These results indicate that serum IL-6
concentrations were significantly higher in children with APN than in patients
with lower UTI.

Using a mouse mammary tumor model based on orthotopic transplantation of
luciferase-expressing mouse ILC cells (KEP1-Luc cells), we evaluated the
diagnostic value of three clinically applied tracers: (99m)Tc-(V)-DMSA,
(99m)Tc-MIBI, and (99m)Tc-HDP. Uptake of the tracers is compared using static and
dynamic imaging procedures. We found that dynamic imaging in combination with
pixel-by-pixel color coding has an added value over (high resolution) static
imaging procedures. Such dynamic imaging procedures could enhance the potential
of breast-specific gamma-imaging.

Multifunctional nanoparticles composed of MnFe₂O₄ were encapsulated in chitosan
for investigation of system to combine magnetically-triggered drug delivery and
localized hyperthermia for cancer treatment with the previously published
capacity of MnFe₂O₄ to be used as an efficient MRI contrast agent for cancer
diagnosis. This paper focuses on the synthesis and characterization of magnetic
MnFe₂O₄ nanoparticles, their dispersion in water and their incorporation in
chitosan, which serves as a drug carrier. The surface of the MnFe₂O₄
nanoparticles was modified with meso-2,3-di-mercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) to
develop stable aqueous dispersions. The nanoparticles were coated with chitosan, 
and the magnetic properties, heat generation and hydrodynamic size of
chitosan-coated MnFe₂O₄ were evaluated for various linker concentrations and in a
range of pH conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Renal artery stenosis can lead to renovascular hypertension;
however, the detection of stenosis alone does not guarantee the presence of
renovascular hypertension. Renovascular hypertension depends on activation of the
renin-angiotensin system, which can be detected by functional tests such as
captopril renal scintigraphy. A method that allows direct measurement of the
baseline and post-captopril glomerular filtration rate using chromium-51 labeled 
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ((51)Cr-EDTA) could add valuable information to 
the investigation of hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis. The
purposes of this study were to create a protocol to measure the baseline and
post-captopril glomerular filtration rate using (51)Cr-EDTA, and to verify
whether changes in the glomerular filtration rate permit differentiation between 
hypertensive patients with and without renal artery stenosis.
METHODS: This prospective study included 41 consecutive patients with poorly
controlled severe hypertension. All patients had undergone a radiological
investigation of renal artery stenosis within the month prior to their inclusion.
The patients were divided into two groups: patients with (n=21) and without renal
artery stenosis, (n=20). In vitro glomerular filtration rate analysis
((51)Cr-EDTA) and (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy were performed before and after
captopril administration in all patients.
RESULTS: The mean baseline glomerular filtration rate was 48.6+/-21.8 ml/kg/1.73 
m(2) in the group wuth renal artery stenosis, which was significantly lower than 
the GFR of 65.1+/-28.7 ml/kg/1.73m(2) in the group without renal artery stenosis 
(p=0.04). Captopril induced a significant reduction of the glomerular filtration 
rate in the group with renal artery stenosis (to 32.6+/-14.8 ml/ kg/1.73m(2),
p=0.001) and an insignificant change in the group without RAS (to 62.2+/-23.6
ml/kg/1.73m(2), p=0.68). Scintigraphy with technetium-99m dimercapto-succinic
acid (DMSA) did not show significant differences in differential renal function
from baseline to post-captopril images in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: Captopril induced a decrease in the GFR that could be quantitatively
measured with (51)Cr-EDTA. The reduction is more pronounced in hypertensive
patients with RAS.

New method and detection of high concentrations of monomethylarsonous acid
detected in contaminated groundwater.

Monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII) was detected in groundwater from a former
herbicide production plant in the USA. The site has total arsenic concentrations 
up to thousands of mg/L, representing one of the most severe cases of arsenic
contamination ever reported. Structure-specific detection of MMAIII, along with
arsenite (AsIII), arsenate (AsV), monomethylarsonic acid (MMAV), and
dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV), was achieved using liquid chromatography separation 
with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS).
To enable the electrospray of MMAIII and AsIII, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
was used to derivatize these trivalent arsenicals online, so that their complexes
with DMSA could be detected using negative ionization ESI-MS/MS. The presence of 
MMAIII was verified using high resolution mass spectrometry to measure accurate
mass, tandem mass spectrometry to monitor fragmentation, and three different
separation techniques to resolve arsenic species. The measured accurate mass of
the suspected MMAIII compound in a groundwater sample was 122.9607+/-0.0003 amu, 
which was in good agreement with the theoretical value and that of the MMAIII
standard. Simultaneous monitoring of AsO+ at m/z 91 and SO+ at m/z 48 using
HPLC-ICPMS operating in dynamic reaction cell mode ruled out possible confounding
from any sulfur-containing arsenic compound. The concentrations of MMAIII found
in the groundwater samples from a contaminated site were as high as 3.9-274 mg/L,
the highest ever observed in the environment.

Calgary, 3330 Hospital Drive NW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 4N1.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) with a
triple-bolus contrast administration protocol for preoperative anatomical and
functional assessment of living renal donors.
METHODS: Fifty-five potential living renal donors underwent MDCT of which 27
proceeded to donor nephrectomy. A triple-bolus contrast administration protocol
was used for simultaneous acquisition of arterial, nephrographic, and excretory
phases. MDCT images were independently reviewed in random order by two
radiologists blinded to surgical anatomy findings. Diagnostic accuracy for
anatomical variants was quantified by sensitivity and specificity. Differential
renal function (DRF) was derived from MDCT for 54 patients and compared with
technetium-99 m dimercaptosuccinic acid renography (Tc-99 m DMSA).
RESULTS: All triple-bolus MDCT examinations were technically adequate. Accessory 
renal arteries and veins were identified at surgery in 33% (n = 9/27) and 22%
(n = 6/27) of donor kidneys. The mean difference between MDCT-derived DRF and
DMSA was 0.8% (95% CI 0.1-1.6) with 95% limits of agreement of -4.6% (95% CI -3.3
to -5.9) to 6.3% (95% CI 5.0-7.6). MDCT delivered a mean (SD, range) radiation
dose of 9.5 (3.6, 3.6-17.3) mSv.
CONCLUSION: MDCT with a triple-bolus contrast administration provides accurate
anatomical and functional evaluation of living renal donors.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Smilax glabra Roxb. is a traditional Chinese
herb, the rhizome of Smilax glabra has been used in folk medicine for the
treatment of lead poisoning.
AIMS OF THE STUDY: The present study was conducted to investigate the protective 
role of Smilax glabra extract (SGE) individually or combined with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) against the effects of lead acetate on
oxidative stress and lead burden in rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The biochemical parameters and enzymes in different
treated rats were determined by commercial kits. The metal concentrations were
measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
RESULTS: SGE (300 mg/kg) showed very low toxicity to organs in non-lead exposed
rats. Administration of SGE individually had no effect on blood zinc
protoporphyrin (ZPP) level but significantly enhanced the glutathione (GSH)
content and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities in lead exposed 
rats. The co-treatment of SGE and DMSA had a synergism in increasing brain, liver
and kidney superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities and GSH level,
and decreasing oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and thiobarbituric acid reactive
substances (TBARS) levels. Moreover, the co-treatment could improve the hepatic
and renal histopathology changes. SGE as chelating agent showed significant
efficiency in reducing blood and tissue lead burden.
CONCLUSIONS: The in vivo results suggested that SGE individually or combined with
DMSA exhibited remarkable protective effects on lead-induced oxidative stress and
lead burden in rats.

We conducted a retrospective multicenter review to estimate the prevalence of
urological abnormalities in Chinese children with first febrile urinary tract
infection (UTI) and to evaluate the selective imaging strategy recommended by the
NICE guideline for detecting underlying abnormalities. Atypical UTI was defined
as in the NICE UTI guideline. Overall, 576 boys and 244 girls aged below 24
months were reviewed. All underwent ultrasound (US) and micturating
cystourethrogram (MCUG) and 612 underwent DMSA scans. US was abnormal in 73
(8.9%) and vesicoureteral reflux was shown in 195 patients (23.8%). A total of
126 patients were considered to have remediable urological abnormalities
requiring additional surgical or medical interventions. The NICE guideline
yielded excellent negative predictive values (NPV) of 100-94.4% in girls but 91% 
in boys. If all boys underwent US and DMSA and only those with atypical UTI or
abnormal US or DMSA proceeded to MCUG, then the NPV increased to 95.2% and 97.4% 
for boys aged below and above 6 months, respectively. These revised strategies
would substantially save invasive studies-DMSA and MCUG in 27 and 74% of girls
aged below and above 6 months, respectively, or MCUG in 23 and 59% of boys aged
below and above 6 months, respectively.

Research for radiodiagnostic agents should considerate biological critical
parameters which will give own contribution on the absorbed dose. The
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) labeled with (99m)Tc(V) is a radiopharmaceutical
which has well established role in medullar thyroid carcinoma and has been
proposed in evaluation of bone metastasis. This work studied the biokinetics and 
dosimetry of (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA by animal model. The (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA was prepared
from a (III)DMSA kit alkalized. Mice (n=5) received (99m)Tc(V)DMSA i.v., they
were sacrificed (30 min, 1h, 5h and 12h), the organs excised and the activities
measured by a gamma counter. The results were evaluated based on %activity/g and 
the absorbed dose was estimated (MIRDOSE 3.0 program) by extrapolation of data
from animal to human scale. The results showed the majority of organs reached the
top uptake at 30 min, the greatest kidney uptake was (4.81 +/- 1.38)% activity/g,
while the bone presented its highest uptake at 1h (5.49+/- 0.47)% activity/g,
after 1h all the organs had activity exponential decrease. The biokinetic profile
of (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA was well established, allowing quantifying of residence time, 
and the radiation dose estimates were made for this agent. About the absorbed
dose, the preliminary results showed higher value to bone, being the soft tissue 
dose relatively low.

Surgical intervention in children with vesicoureteric reflux: are we intervening 
too late?

Khalil BA(1), Goyal A, Dickson AP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatric Urology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital,
Manchester, M27 4HA, UK.

BACKGROUND: Vesicoureteric reflux is usually managed medically. When medical
management fails, the patient is referred for surgical intervention. The aim is
to protect the kidneys from progressive damage. This study investigates if
significant kidney damage has occurred during medical treatment prior to surgical
intervention.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case notes of all children treated with ureteric
re-implantation for vesicoureteric reflux in a 5-year period were reviewed.
Demographic details, radiological investigations, surgery and follow-up were
recorded. Indication for surgery was failure of medical treatment. Kidney damage 
was defined as the presence of a scar on the DMSA scans and/or kidney function
below 45% in one kidney.
RESULTS: Forty-two patients underwent ureteric re-implantation with 24 having a
bilateral procedure resulting in a total of 66 renal units. Mean age at surgery
was 7.4 years. Thirty-eight kidneys (58%) showed reduced function prior to
medical treatment. Twenty-four kidneys (36%) had deterioration of renal function 
associated with recurrent urinary tract infections during the course of medical
treatment with the overall mean function of the worst affected kidney being 28%. 
Thirty-five patients (83%) demonstrated scarring on their kidneys on DMSA scan
prior to surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of patients who eventually need ureteric
re-implantation for vesicoureteric reflux have already suffered kidney damage
prior to start of medical treatment. A third will have progressive deterioration 
of their renal functions. Early referral for medical management coupled with
early surgical intervention in selected cases should hopefully reduce the number 
of children with renal damage due to VUR.

Comment in
    J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2010 Mar;23(3):211-3.

BACKGROUND: There is a poorly understood association between obesity and
hypertension. We demonstrated abnormalities of adrenal androgen and cortisol
metabolites in four hypertensive obese children.
PATIENTS: Four males (aged 10 to 15 years) were evaluated for systolic blood
pressures consistently above the 99.6th percentile. All were overweight with BMI 
ranging from 27-35. Clinical examinations, renal ultrasound and DMSA scans were
normal. Plasma electrolytes, renin, aldosterone, cortisol, testosterone, ACTH and
TSH were normal. 24-Hour urinary steroid profiles showed a generalised excess of 
adrenal androgen and cortisol metabolites in all cases. Relevant recognised
disorders of adrenal androgen and cortisol metabolism were excluded.
CONCLUSION: There is no clinical condition explaining these abnormal urinary
steroid profiles. These results support previous findings and provide new data on
abnormal urinary adrenal androgen excretion in obese hypertensive patients.
Further studies may determine the relationship between obesity, hypertension and 
the observed abnormalities of urinary steroid excretion.

Does severity of renal scarring on DMSA scan predict abnormalities in creatinine 
clearance?

Yiee JH(1), DiSandro M, Wang MH, Hittelman A, Baskin LS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between severity of renal scarring and
creatinine clearance. Existing studies on renal scarring and functional outcomes 
have focused on the presence or absence of scarring.
METHODS: Patients with a history of urinary tract infection leading to the
diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux were recruited. These subjects were admitted
to a pediatric research center for an in-patient collection of 24-hour urine to
be sent for creatinine and protein. DMSA scans performed at least 6 months after 
documented urinary tract infection were graded by 3 independent, blinded
pediatric urologists for renal scarring according to the Randomized Intervention 
for Children with Vesicoureteral Reflux study criteria.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine subjects (14 girls, 15 boys) with a median age of 7 years
were recruited. Scar grading was reliable between the observers with a Kappa
score of 0.66-0.75. On DMSA scan, 10% were scar-free, 62% had unilateral scars,
and 28% had bilateral scars. Mean creatinine clearance was 123 for those with
unilateral disease and 100 for those with bilateral disease (P = .048). Median
proteinuria (58 mg/dL) and serum creatinine (0.5 mg/dL) were similar between the 
2 groups. Creatinine clearance did not differ according to average scar grade,
taking both kidneys into account.
CONCLUSIONS: In children with vesicoureteral reflux, although those with
bilateral scarring have a significantly lower creatinine clearance than those
with unilateral scarring, the severity of scar grade alone does not predict
overall creatinine clearance with short-term follow-up.

Medicine, Medical Sciences/University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.

AIM: The incidence of urinary tract anomalies varies in different population and 
depends on several factors such as underlying etiologies. The goal of this study 
was to investigate the incidence of abnormal urinary tract ultrasound findings in
children with different etiologies.
METHODS: In a case-series study, 100 neonates who were hospitalized in the
Children's Hospital Medical Center with the different etiologies such as sepsis, 
icter, seizure, and respiratory distress were included. In all neonates,
ultrasound study was performed by using 3.5-7.5 MHz probe and neonates with the
diagnosis of urinary tract infection underwent DMSA scan and voiding
cystourethrogram (VCUG).
RESULTS: The mean age of neonates was 10.15+/-7.45 days and 56% of patients were 
male. The most frequent etiologies led to hospitalization were icter (37%),
sepsis (35%), and infectious respiratory distress (10%). Abnormal sonographic
findings were found in 5% of patients. The frequency of urinary tract anomalies
in neonates with sepsis was higher than non-septic group (14.29% versus 0.0%,
P=0.008).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of urinary tract anomalies which detected by sonography
in our population is higher than other reported studies and has strong
relationship with the occurrence of neonatal sepsis.

We have developed a new genetic algorithm approach to search for the global
lowest-energy structures of ligand-protected metal clusters. In combination with 
density functional theory, our genetic algorithm simulations show that the ground
state of [Ag(7)(DMSA)(4)](-) has eight instead of four Ag-S bonds and has a much 
lower energy than the structure based on the [Ag(7)(SR)(4)](-) cluster with a
quasi-two-dimensional Ag(7) core. The simulated X-ray diffraction pattern of the 
[Ag(7)(DMSA)(4)](-) cluster is in good agreement with the experimental result.
Our calculations for the [Ag(7)(SR)(4)](-) and [Ag(7)(DMSA)(4)](-) clusters
reveal for the first time that -RS-Ag-RS- can be a stable motif in
thiolate-protected Ag clusters. In addition, the lowest-energy structures of
[Ag(7)S(4)](-), [Ag(6)S(4)](-), and [Ag(5)S(4)](-) are predicted.

A safe strategy to decrease fetal lead exposure in a woman with chronic
intoxication.

School, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. drleiba@gmail.com

During pregnancy skeletal lead is mobilized by maternal bone turnover and can
threaten fetal development. The exact strategy suggested to women of childbearing
age, who were chronically exposed to lead, and, thus, have high bone lead burden,
is not well established. We describe 4 years of follow-up of a 29-year-old woman 
with chronic lead intoxication. We (a) advised her to delay conception until
'toxicological clearance', (b) treated her with multiple courses of lead
chelator, DMSA, and (c) prescribed oral calcium. Patient had low blood lead and
protoporphyrin level during pregnancy until delivery. Delaying conception, lead
chelation, and calcium supplementation can decrease fetal exposure.

Diagnosing Acute Pyelonephritis with CT, Tc-DMSA SPECT, and Doppler Ultrasound: A
Comparative Study.

Yoo JM(1), Koh JS, Han CH, Lee SL, Ha US, Kang SH, Jung YS, Lee YS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 
Seoul, Korea.

PURPOSE: With growing interest in early imaging, the aim of our study was to
define the most practical modality for routine clinical use for the diagnosis of 
acute pyelonephritis (APN). We compared the sensitivity of enhanced computerized 
tomography (CT), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, and Doppler
ultrasonography (DUS) by using clinical findings as the standard of reference.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 207 APN patients (191 women, 16 men; mean age, 
49.4 years; range, 17-88 years) were enrolled in this study. All the patients
underwent imaging modalities during hospitalization. SPECT images were obtained 4
hours after injection of (99m)Tc-DMSA. Transverse and coronary CT images were
obtained before and after injection of the contrast agent. DUS was performed in
the longitudinal, transverse, and coronal planes. All the images were read
independently by a single radiologist and a nuclear medicine specialist. The
sensitivity of each modality for detecting APN was compared.
RESULTS: CT showed significantly superior sensitivity compared with that of DUS
(81.0% vs. 33.3%, respectively, n=147). DMSA scintigraphy also showed
significantly superior sensitivity compared with that of DUS (74.7% vs. 33.3%,
respectively, n=150). Compared with DMSA scintigraphy, CT showed superior
sensitivity, but the difference was not statistically significant (81.0% vs.
74.8%, respectively, n=147, p=0.163).
CONCLUSIONS: For cases of clinically suspected APN, CT and DMSA scintigraphy
appear to be equally sensitive and reliable for detecting APN, although CT is
more practical in various fields. DUS was significantly less sensitive.

The Bnai Zion Planar Method: a simplified technique for the quantitation of the
absolute renal uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA in children.

Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel. miguel.gorenberg@b-zion.org.il

AIM AND PURPOSE: Radionuclide imaging of the kidneys using dimercaptosuccinic
acid chelate labeled with technetium-99m (Tc-DMSA) is a well-established method
for evaluating the extent of kidney parenchymal involvement in the scenario of
urinary tract infection and for the estimation of the functional renal mass. We
have developed a simplified technique, Bnai Zion Planar Method (BZPM), to
estimate absolute DMSA uptake by the kidneys, which uses a shorter time of
acquisition and does not require cumbersome calculations of attenuation
correction. The aim of this study was to validate this technique by comparing it 
with the Quantitative DMSA single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
(QDMSA) measurements as the reference method.
METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive children (mean age 5.4+/-4.8 years) were included 
in the study. Absolute uptake of the radiopharmaceutical by the kidneys was
measured using the QDMSA SPECT methods described earlier with data acquisition of
20 min. Kidney volumes and radioactivity concentration measurements were
calculated on the reconstruction data using the threshold method. For the
simplified technique (BZPM), a planar posterior view of the kidneys was acquired 
for 1 min at the end of the QDMSA SPECT study.
RESULTS: In both kidneys we observed a significant strong correlation between the
two methods. BZPM measurements were very similar to those obtained using the
validated QDMSA method, as determined by linear regression analysis (Pearson's
r=0.924, P<0.001), r(2)=0.854. The uptake according to QDMSA can be predicted by 
the uptake measured by the BZPM method using the following regression equation:
QDMSA=0.445+1.061 BZPM.
CONCLUSION: BZPM estimation in children using the newly proposed planar method
was found to be nearly identical to the validated QDMSA SPECT method.

The Clinical Significance of Intrarenal Reflux in Voiding Cystourethrography
(VCUG).

Kim SW(1), Im YJ, Hong CH, Han SW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Urological Science Institute, Yonsei University College
of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

PURPOSE: Intrarenal reflux (IRR) occurs in 3-10% of cases of total reflux and can
lead to renal injury, which may eventually result in renal scarring. In this
study, we evaluated the clinical importance of IRR detected by voiding
cystourethrography and evaluated the relationship between IRR and renal scarring.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2002 to May 2008, 50 patients who were
diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and showed IRR in voiding
cystourethrography were enrolled. IRR was seen in 59 renal units in our enrolled 
patients. A (99m)Tc 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan was performed
after VUR was detected in all cases. Nine patients were conservatively treated
with prophylactic antibiotics, whereas 41 patients received an anti-reflux
operation. A follow-up renal scan was performed after 3 to 6 months to check for 
any changes in renal scarring.
RESULTS: The average patient age was 9.2 months (range, 1-42 months). Forty-nine 
patients were male; only one patient was female. The mean duration until surgery 
was 2.9 months. Generally, the IRR sites corresponded to the sites of photon
defects on DMSA renal scans (76.3%). Furthermore, the photon defects on IRR sites
tended to progress to renal scarring (65.2%). The rate of change in scarring was 
lower in the surgery group (47.1%) than in the prophylactic antibiotic group
(75%).
CONCLUSIONS: IRR sites and the sites of photon defects on DMSA renal scans showed
a high correspondence, and these sites tended to progress to renal scarring. We
suggest that VUR with IRR should be actively managed to decrease the chances of
renal scarring.

Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal which causes concern as an environmental toxicant. 
Therapy with chelating agents is considered to be the rational treatment against 
metal poisoning. This study was designed to evaluate whether
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) could alleviate oxidative stress and
vascular dysfunction in mice with subchronic exposure to Cd. Male ICR mice
received CdCl2 (100 mg/L) via drinking water for 8 weeks. After Cd exposure, DMSA
at a dose of 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg was intragastrically administered once daily
for 5 consecutive days at the end of Cd treatment. It was found that Cd-induced
hypertension and markedly blunted vascular responses to vasoactive agents,
including acetylcholine, phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside. Treatment with
DMSA significantly restored blood pressure and improved vascular responsiveness
when compared with Cd-treated controls. Moreover, DMSA protected against
Cd-induced severe oxidative stress by normalization of the redox ratios of
glutathione to glutathione disulfide and suppression of plasma malondialdehyde,
plasma protein carbonyl, urinary nitrate/nitrite, and superoxide production from 
thoracic aorta. DMSA partially reduced Cd contents in the blood, heart, liver and
kidneys. In conclusion, our present study provides the first evidence of the
therapeutic efficacy of DMSA against oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in
Cd-intoxicated mice.

Renal function measurements using (99m)Tc-DTPA and (99m)Tc-MAG(3) dynamic
scintigraphs were compared to those obtained using (99m)Tc-DMSA static
scintigraphy. Eighteen experimental rabbits were randomly divided into
(99m)Tc-DTPA-, (99m)Tc-MAG(3)-, and (99m) Tc-DMSA-injected groups. Experimental
unilateral renal damage was induced by ligating a unilateral right ureter in 18
rabbits. Scintigraphic images were obtained at 2 and 5 h after intravenous
injection of (99m)Tc-DMSA, or immediately after administration of (99m)Tc-DTPA or
(99m)Tc-MAG(3). For the dynamic images using (99m)Tc-DTPA and (99m)Tc-MAG(3),
rapid sequential images were obtained every 2 s for 30 images up to 1 min. The
three groups presented different relative renal functions between the left normal
and the right abnormal kidneys at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks post-ligation (p<0.05).
However, the between-group comparisons showed no significant differences at any
time. These results suggest that dynamic images of (99m)Tc-DTPA and
(99m)Tc-MAG(3) can be used to measure the relative renal function in place of the
static image of (99m)Tc-DMSA.

Metalltoxikologie).

We collected 149 hair samples at the Baba Farid Centre at Faridkot in Punjab,
India to evaluate the trace and toxic metal concentration via ICP-MS. A total of 
53 elements were tested. The hair of the children tested showed high values for
Ba, Cd, Mn, Pb and U, signifying long-term exposure. Urine baseline testing
supported hair analysis findings for all the elements listed above; a DMSA
(Dimercapto Succinic Acid) challenge test raised urinary values for lead. Testing
of six randomly selected water samples showed concentrations above the European
maximum contaminant level for uranium (U) in three samples and lead (Pb) in
one.Research aim:To evaluate if hair analysis and/or urine provocation confirm or
refute long term metal intoxication. To support or refute that hair mineral
analysis confirms urine challenge test results. To support or refute that a DMSA 
urine challenge test provides a valuable treatment option for metal exposure in
children.CONCLUSION: Our results documented that hair and urine mineral analysis 
results are supportive of each other, and are both useful diagnostic tools in
chelation therapy. We also documented that a DMSA challenge test confirms long
term exposure as detected through hair mineral analysis. This indicates that the 
chelating agent DMSA (Dimercapto succinic acid) provides a safe and valuable
treatment option for lead overexposure.

A novel electrochemiluminescent (ECL) sensing system was constructed for
low-potential detection of metal ion by immobilizing surface-unpassivated CdTe
quantum dots (QDs) on a glassy carbon electrode. The surface-unpassivated CdTe
QDs were prepared using meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) as a stabilizer
to cap CdTe QDs and characterized with scanning electron micrograph and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. The immobilized QDs showed a strong cathodic ECL
emission peak at -0.87 V with an onset potential at -0.64 V (vs Ag/AgCl/saturated
KCl) in air-saturated, pH 9.0 HCl-Tris buffer. On the basis of the competition of
metal ion to the stabilizer, the quenching effect of metal ion on ECL emission
was observed, which led to a sensitive chemical sensing application. Using cupric
cation as a model analyte, the sensor showed a linear range from 5.0 nM to 7.0
muM with a detection limit of 3.0 nM and had been successfully applied in the
detection of copper in human hair. It could be extended to detect other metal
ions with stronger metal-S interaction than with the Cd-S bond. As an example,
the sensor could be used to detect Hg(2+) down to 1.4 nM. The bidentate chelate
QD-based sensor exhibited a promising platform for rapid detection of cations
with strong metal-S interaction and could be further applied for development of
other low-potential electrochemical sensing systems.

PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy 
(ESWL) and possible deleterious effects on renal parenchyma of children subjected
to treatment of renal lithiasis, using renal scintigraphy with 99mTc
dimercapto-succunic acid (DMSA).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2004 to November 2007, 18 children (age 3-10
years) underwent ESWL (Philips-Dornier) for kidney urolithiasis. All patients
underwent preoperative evaluation, including physical examination, urine culture,
image exams and renal scintigraphy with Tc99-DMSA. Evaluation after treatment
consisted of a clinical examination, blood pressure measurement, urine culture,
renal ultrasound and Tc99-DMSA, repeated at 3, 6 and 12 months, which were
compared to the scans obtained before ESWL to determine possible morphological or
functional changes.
RESULTS: Success in the stones fragmentation was achieved in all cases - in 9
patients (50%) with one session of ESWL, in 6 (33%) with two sessions and in 3
patients (17%) with 3 sessions of ESWL. Only one patient (5%), after three
sessions of ESWL and 6 months of follow-up showed change in size of right kidney 
with a decrease in tubular function, without hypertension or other major changes.
In the other cases, there was absence of hypertension up to 12 months of
follow-up, absence of renal hematomas detected by ultrasound or significant renal
scars in scintigraphic examinations.
CONCLUSION: ESWL is effective and safe for treating renal lithiasis in children. 
Renal parenchyma lesions may occur early after treatment, but these lesions are
transients and resolve spontaneously in virtually all cases; generally, there are
no irreversible renal lesions associated with ESWL, even after the follow-up
period with clinical examination, ultrasound examination and 99mTc-DMSA
scintigraphy.

OBJECTIVES: Split renal function (SRF) estimated from the posterior view of
(99m)Tc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid planar scintigraphy (DTPA/P) is not
sufficiently accurate even after correction for kidney depth by computed
tomography (CT). To obtain more accurate SRF using (99m)Tc-DTPA, dynamic SPECT
method was carried out for the initial 5 min after bolus injection of
(99m)Tc-DTPA (DTPA/SPECT). Also SRF was evaluated from the renal volume measured 
by CT. We compared the results with (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid SPECT
(DMSA/SPECT).
METHODS: In 60 consecutive live kidney donors, 30 DTPA/P, 30 DTPA/SPECT, 60
(99m)Tc-DMSA/SPECT, and 60 CT studies were performed. In the DTPA/P studies, SRF 
was calculated from the posterior image recorded during 2-3-min postinjection
with attenuation correction for kidney depth measured by CT. In the DTPA/SPECT
studies, SPECT images were acquired continuously for 5 min with a dual-headed
gamma camera. In (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy, DMSA/SPECT images were acquired 3-h
postinjection. The SRF on both SPECT studies was calculated from the total counts
of each kidney. In the DTPA/SPECT study, SRF was evaluated on the three images
summed for 1 min: 1-2 min (DTPA/SPECT1-2), 2-3 min (DTPA/SPECT2-3), and 1-3 min
(DTPA/SPECT1-3). In the CT examination, to assess the global renal volume, the
axial images in the excretory phase were chosen. Renal contours were identified
on each image, and the areas (cm(2)) of these regions were summed and multiplied 
by the slice thickness (10 mm) to yield global renal volume (ml). Right renal
function from DTPA/P, DTPA/SPECT, and CT were compared with that from DMSA/SPECT 
as a reference.
RESULTS: Correlation coefficients of the right renal function between DMSA/SPECT 
and DTPA/P, DTPA/SPECT2-3, and CT were 0.663, 0.849 and 0.907, respectively (P < 
0.0001). The differences between DMSA/SPECT and DTPA/P, DTPA/SPECT2-3 and CT were
2.42 +/- 3.878, 0.867 +/- 1.672, and -0.421 +/- 1.077% (mean +/- SD),
respectively.
CONCLUSION: SRF derived from DTPA/SPECT showed a better correlation with
DMSA/SPECT and significantly fewer errors (P < 0.05) than DTPA/P. A significant
strong correlation was observed between SRF from DMSA/SPECT and CT, indicating
the utility of CT renal volumetry for evaluating SRF.

acid: a coordinative and toxicological approach.

Compostela, 15782 Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain.

We investigated the reaction of Pb(2+), PbMe(2)(2+) and PbPh(2)(2+) with
3-(phenyl)-2-sulfanylpropenoic acid (H(2)pspa) to give the complexes [Pb(pspa)], 
[PbMe(2)(pspa)], [PbPh(2)(pspa)], [HQ](2)[Pb(pspa)(2)] and
[HQ[(2)[PbPh(2)(pspa)(2)] (HQ=diisopropylammonium), which were characterized by
IR and NMR ((1)H, (13)C and (207)Pb) spectroscopy and by fast atom bombardment
(FAB) spectrometry. The structures of [PbMe(2)(pspa)], [PbPh(2)(pspa)],
[PbPh(2)(pspa)(dmso)].dmso and [HQ[(2)[PbPh(2)(pspa)(2)] are interesting examples
of unexplored Pb coordination kernels and supramolecular association. Pig renal
proximal tubule LLC-PK1 culture cells were used to determine in vitro the effect 
of the pretreatment with H(2)pspa (alone or combined with vitamin B(6)) and
[HQ](2)[Zn(pspa)(2)] on the cytotoxicity of PbMe(2)(2+) and PbPh(2)(2+) by
comparing the results with those of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (dmsa). The 
results show that the cell viability was scarcely affected by these agents. The
ability of these reagents to decorporate lead was investigated in vivo by
analysing the lead levels in the liver, kidney, brain and blood. In the case of
the dimethyl derivative, and under certain protocols, undesirable effects such as
an increase in brain and liver lead levels were detected. These increases were
not detected when the diphenyl derivative was assayed but in this case a positive
effect was not identified either. The blood lead levels also increased in the
case of the dimethyl derivative and the activity of delta-ALAD was significantly 
recovered upon treatment with vitamin B(6) or H(2)pspa; neither the blood lead
levels nor the delta-ALAD activity was modified in the case of the diphenyl
derivative.

Questionnaire survey of hospitals in Saitama Prefecture regarding the shortage of
99mTc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals and 99Mo/99mTc generators.

OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted at all 32 hospitals
in Saitama Prefecture to investigate the current difficult situation in terms of 
nuclear medicine management in the face of the (99m)Tc shortage due to
insufficient supply, and 29 hospitals (90.6%) replied.
RESULTS: Of the 29, 15 (51.7%) reported a reduction in the number of nuclear
medicine studies performed due to the shortage of supply, although the reduction 
was small. The decrease per month was less than 20 studies in 73% of the
institutions. Of the nuclear medicine studies that involve the use of (99m)Tc,
the studies whose reduction in number most seriously affected patient management 
were, in decreasing order: (99m)Tc-MAA lung perfusion scans, (99m)Tc-MAG(3),
(99m)Tc-DTPA, or (99m)Tc-DMSA renoscans, (99m)Tc-MDP bone scans, (99m)Tc-HMPAO or
ECD brain SPECT studies, (99m)Tc-MIBI or tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT studies,
(99m)Tc-radiocolloid sentinel lymphoscintigraphy, (99m)Tc-HSA-D or pyrophosphate 
bleeding scans, (99m)Tc-GSA hepatic function reserve scans, and (99m)Tc-MIBI
parathyroid scans. The reduction is probably ascribable to factors such as
cancellations of emergency studies, absence of substitute studies, sequential
studies using the same radiopharmaceutical, and higher cost of the syringe-type
products than the vial-type products. Substitutes for (99m)Tc studies were
performed at 52% (15/29) of the institutions. Myocardial perfusion imaging with
(201)Tl chloride was the most common substitute study.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this survey suggested the several procedures to
resolve the issues related to the shortage. The staffs at all institutions except
one gave the impression that their nuclear medicine ordering systems had been
greatly affected by the shortage of supply. This adverse circumstance, however,
may provide a good opportunity to educate the public about nuclear medicine
studies that use (99m)Tc and SPECT, with which citizen are now unfamiliar.

Paradoxical effect of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) on enhancing
antitumor activity of cisplatin in ascites sarcoma 180 cells.

We investigated the enhancing effect of two metal-chelating compounds,
2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA), on the antitumor activity of cisplatin (CDDP). In the in vivo
experiments, DMPS showed a clear synergistic effect and significantly enhanced
the antitumor activity of CDDP in terms of survival and life span in mice
transplanted with ascites sarcoma 180 cells (S180 cells) at a dose of <100
micromol/kg, s.c., but not at a dose of >500 micromol/kg. On the other hand, DMSA
did not enhance the antitumor activity of CDDP. DMPS (50 micromol/kg, s.c.)
combined with CDDP also potently suppressed [(3)H]thymidine uptake in S180 cells 
implanted in mice, whereas DMSA did not. In the in vitro experiments, DMPS
(10(-6) to 10(-5) M) produced a time- and dose-dependent decrease in
intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in S180 cells and, in
combination with CDDP, yielded a significant increase in intracellular platinum
accumulation compared to that in cells treated with CDDP alone. These results
indicate that DMPS used in combination with CDDP may be of considerable benefit
in enhancing the cytotoxicity of CDDP in tumor cells, especially at a low dose.
The results also suggest that the enhancing effect of DMPS is closely related to 
a decrease in [Ca(2+)](i) and that the suitable dose and adequate
administrational time of DMPS are important for its effective action.

We report a case of total hyperpigmentation of the skin, severe itching, muscle
weakness and thrombocytosis. Laboratory investigation showed white blood cell
(WBC) 8.2 x 10(6)/L, Hb 125 g/L, platelets 1221 x 10(6)/L and urinary lead after 
DMSA mobilization test 2684 mcg/g creatinine (normal <5). Chelation therapy with 
DMSA resulted in complete recovery of the hyperpigmentation, itching and
thrombocytosis. Lead poisoning should be considered in the differential diagnosis
of obscured thrombocytosis.

Mumbai, India.

AIM: Evaluation of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in children by bladder volume
graded direct radionuclide cystogram (BVG DRC). This technique allows detection
of VUR at different bladder volume grades.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 33 patients (66 renal units)
with suspected vesicoureteric reflux were subjected to a voiding cystourethrogram
(VCUG) and BVG DRC. The patients were assessed further with radioisotope renal
scans for renal cortical scars.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients and 36 renal units were found to have VUR in either 
of the reflux studies. A VCUG was able to detect 20 units (55.50%) and a BVG DRC 
was able to detect 35 units (97.2%). A VCUG had a test accuracy of 77.8% and a
BVG DRC had a test accuracy of 98.6%. There was a positive correlation between
bladder volume grades and scarring on a DMSA scan.
CONCLUSIONS: Like a conventional DRC, BVG DRC is a sensitive and an accurate
test. It gives additional information on the reflux phenomenon with respect to
bladder filling. The bladder volume graded technique is better than conventional 
DRC for grading of VUR.

Visualizing interactions along the Escherichia coli twin-arginine translocation
pathway using protein fragment complementation.

The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway is well known for its ability to
export fully folded substrate proteins out of the cytoplasm of gram-negative and 
gram-positive bacteria. Studies of this mechanism in Escherichia coli have
identified numerous transient protein-protein interactions that guide
export-competent proteins through the Tat pathway. To visualize these
interactions, we have adapted bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to 
detect protein-protein interactions along the Tat pathway of living cells.
Fragments of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were fused to soluble and
transmembrane factors that participate in the translocation process including Tat
substrates, Tat-specific proofreading chaperones and the integral membrane
proteins TatABC that form the translocase. Fluorescence analysis of these YFP
chimeras revealed a wide range of interactions such as the one between the Tat
substrate dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DmsA) and its dedicated proofreading
chaperone DmsD. In addition, BiFC analysis illuminated homo- and
hetero-oligomeric complexes of the TatA, TatB and TatC integral membrane proteins
that were consistent with the current model of translocase assembly. In the case 
of TatBC assemblies, we provide the first evidence that these complexes are
co-localized at the cell poles. Finally, we used this BiFC approach to capture
interactions between the putative Tat receptor complex formed by TatBC and the
DmsA substrate or its dedicated chaperone DmsD. Our results demonstrate that BiFC
is a powerful approach for studying cytoplasmic and inner membrane interactions
underlying bacterial secretory pathways.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in
children, and its role in the pathogenesis of scarred kidney is debated. We
report on a 7-year-old child who presented with severe UTI. The early (day 4)
renal computed tomography (CT) scan showed normal-sized kidneys (110 mm on the
left, 105 mm on the right), whereas the control CT scan and dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) scan, performed 1 and 2 months later, respectively, showed a small
scarred right kidney (60 mm) with a 12% residual function. An intermittent right 
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was diagnosed by direct isotopic cystography and then
treated by Cohen vesicoureteral reimplantation. The patient remained free of
infectious recurrence, hypertension, or renal function decrease. This report
demonstrates that one episode of acute pyelonephritis can lead to severe renal
scarring. Whereas antenatal lesions are thought to have a stronger role in the
causal pathway for reflux nephropathy than is UTI in addition to VUR, this
observation reminds us that UTI can truly play an important role in damaging
kidneys.

DmsD, a Tat system specific chaperone, interacts with other general chaperones
and proteins involved in the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis.

Many bacterial oxidoreductases depend on the Tat translocase for correct cell
localization. Substrates for the Tat translocase possess twin-arginine leaders.
System specific chaperones or redox enzyme maturation proteins (REMPs) are a
group of proteins implicated in oxidoreductase maturation. DmsD is a REMP
discovered in Escherichia coli, which interacts with the twin-arginine leader
sequence of DmsA, the catalytic subunit of DMSO reductase. In this study, we
identified several potential interacting partners of DmsD by using several in
vitro protein-protein interaction screening approaches, including affinity
chromatography, co-precipitation, and cross-linking. Candidate hits from these in
vitro findings were analyzed by in vivo methods of bacterial two-hybrid (BACTH)
and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). From these data, DmsD was
confirmed to interact with the general molecular chaperones DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE,
GroEL, Tig and Ef-Tu. In addition, DmsD was also found to interact with proteins 
involved in the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis pathway. Our data suggests that 
DmsD may play a role as a "node" in escorting its substrate through a cascade of 
chaperone assisted protein-folding maturation events.

The primary inadequacy of chemotherapeutic drugs is their relative
non-specificity and potential side effects to the healthy tissues. To overcome
this, drug loaded multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles are conceptualized. We
report here an aqueous based formulation of glycerol monooleate coated magnetic
nanoparticles (GMO-MNPs) devoid of any surfactant capable of carrying high
payload hydrophobic anticancer drugs. The biocompatibility was confirmed by tumor
necrosis factor alpha assay, confocal microscopy. High entrapment efficiency
approximately 95% and sustained release of encapsulated drugs for more than two
weeks under in vitro conditions was achieved for different anticancer drugs
(paclitaxel, rapamycin, alone or combination). Drug loaded GMO-MNPs did not
affect the magnetization properties of the iron oxide core as confirmed by
magnetization study. Additionally the MNPs were functionalized with carboxylic
groups by coating with DMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic acid) for the supplementary
conjugation of amines. For targeted therapy, HER2 antibody was conjugated to
GMO-MNPs and showed enhanced uptake in human breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7). 
The IC(50) doses revealed potential antiproliferative effect in MCF-7. Therefore,
antibody conjugated GMO-MNPs could be used as potential drug carrier for the
active therapeutic aspects in cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND: We evaluated the variation of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) 
expression in patients with mixed invasive with extensive in situ ductal
carcinomas (IDC + DCIS) and pure IDC, in relation to mammographic breast density 
(%BD), proliferation-seeking radiotracer (99m)Tc(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) uptake (scintimammographic-SMM), proliferation index Ki-67, and estrogen
receptor (ER) status. We also assessed CGRP expression with histological grade.
METHODS: We studied retrospectively 24 women with suspicious findings on
mammography who were evaluated preoperatively with (99m)Tc(V)DMSA
scintimammography. Histology revealed 12 IDC (grade II in 8, grade III in 4
patients; mean size ± SD, 2.6 ± 1.3 cm; mean age ± SD, 66.5 ± 13.1 years) and 12 
IDC + DCIS (grade II in 6, grade III in 6 patients; DCIS component mean
size ± SD, 5.3 ± 1.8 cm; IDC component mean size ± SD, 2.5 ± 1.1 cm; mean
age ± SD, 58.5 ± 15.1 years). Immunohistochemistry for CGRP, Ki-67, and ER status
was performed in all 24 surgical specimens. BD and SMM were calculated by
computer-assisted methods and were statistically correlated with CGRP expression.
BD, SMM, Ki-67, and ER were statistically compared between IDC and IDC + DCIS,
whereas CGRP, Ki-67, and ER were compared between patients with BD >25 and
<25%. CGRP was also compared (t test) between grade II and grade III in both
groups.
RESULTS: Overall positive correlation was found between BD and CGRP (r = 0.577,
P < 0.001). Positive correlation was established between SMM and CGRP only in
IDC + DCIS (r (SMM(IDC+DCIS)-CGRP) = 0.634, P < 0.05). CGRP and Ki-67 were
significantly higher in patients with BD >25% compared with <25% BD patients
(P = 0.00008 and P = 0.014, respectively). BD and SMM were significantly higher
in CGRP(+) than in CGRP(-) patients as well as in IDC + DCIS compared with IDC.
Ki-67 was significantly higher, whereas ER was significantly lower, in IDC + DCIS
than in IDC. In all patients, CGRP was significantly higher in grade II as
compared with grade III (P = 0.005). In the mixed group (IDC + DCIS), grade II
cancers had also significantly higher CGRP values as compared with grade III ones
(P = 0.004). In pure IDC, no statistical difference was found between grade II
and III (P = 0.4).
CONCLUSIONS: ΒD, SMM, CGRP, and Ki-67 were significantly increased, whereas ER
was significantly decreased, in IDC + DCIS as compared with IDC, indicating that 
IDC + DCIS is an entity that is more aggressive, ER independent, and possibly
associated with a pathway linked to stromal involvement and CGRP activity.

A novel electrochemical technique for the production of clinical grade 99mTc
using (n, gamma)99Mo.

INTRODUCTION: In order to meet the growing demand for (99m)Tc and to reduce the
reliance on fission-produced (99)Mo, an electrochemical pathway for accessing
(99m)Tc through the (n, gamma)(99)Mo was explored as a back-up measure and to
supplement (99m)Tc supply for radiopharmaceuticals application.
METHODS: (99m)Tc from an equilibrium mixture of (99)Mo/(99m)Tc was selectively
deposited on a platinum cathode in an electrochemical cell by applying optimal
voltage and stripped back again into the 0.9% saline solution. The radiochemical 
and radionuclidic purity of the product were determined using standard
techniques. (99m)Tc thus obtained was used for labeling standard ligands such as 
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and ethylene dicysteine (EC), to ascertain the
usability.
RESULTS: Selective deposition of (99m)Tc on the platinum electrode was achieved
at a potential of 5 V over a period of 1 h in NaOH electrobath. The overall yield
of (99m)Tc was >90%, with >99.99% radionuclidic purity and >99% radiochemical
purity. The performance of the generator remained consistent over a period of 10 
days. The compatibility of the product in the preparation of (99m)Tc-labeled
formulations such as (99m)Tc-DMSA and (99m)Tc-EC was found to be satisfactory in 
terms of high labeling yields (>98%).
CONCLUSION: A novel and attractive method has been developed to obtain highly
concentrated (99m)Tc, without using fission-produced (99)Mo.

The severity of autism is associated with toxic metal body burden and red blood
cell glutathione levels.

This study investigated the relationship of children's autism symptoms with their
toxic metal body burden and red blood cell (RBC) glutathione levels. In children 
ages 3-8 years, the severity of autism was assessed using four tools: ADOS,
PDD-BI, ATEC, and SAS. Toxic metal body burden was assessed by measuring urinary 
excretion of toxic metals, both before and after oral dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA). Multiple positive correlations were found between the severity of autism 
and the urinary excretion of toxic metals. Variations in the severity of autism
measurements could be explained, in part, by regression analyses of urinary
excretion of toxic metals before and after DMSA and the level of RBC glutathione 
(adjusted R(2) of 0.22-0.45, P < .005 in all cases). This study demonstrates a
significant positive association between the severity of autism and the relative 
body burden of toxic metals.

[Imaging and follow-up of children with first febrile Urinary Tract Infection
(UTI)].

[Article in Hebrew]

Grossman Z(1), Miron D.

Author information: 
(1)Maccabi Healthcare Services, Tel Aviv. zgrosman@netvision.net.il

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children might, in a minority of cases, cause
renal scarring and permanent damage. Known risk factors for renal damage are:
obstruction to urinary flow, vesicoureteric reflux and recurrent infections. The 
current recommendations for imaging and follow-up of children with first febrile 
UTI include renal ultrasound to rule out anatomic abnormalities, particularly
obstruction, cystography for possible diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux, and
prophylactic antibiotic therapy to prevent recurrent infections in children with 
detected reflux. DMSA renal scanning for the detection of renal scars is
recommended as part of the imaging protocol by some institutions. Recently,
published data doubts the importance of the various imaging techniques, as well
as the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic therapy. In the current review,
the role of renal ultrasound is examined, especially with regards to familiar
data from fetal ultrasound. The complex relationship between vesicoureteric
reflux and renal scarring is presented, with the possible implications on the
importance of performing routine cystography and DMSA scanning after UTI. Studies
questioning the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic therapy emphasize the
importance of rapid diagnosis and therapy of suspected recurrent UTI as the
preferred approach to prevent renal damage. Imaging studies are only recommended 
for high risk groups and not as a routine following UTI.

Seventy-five percent nephrectomy and the disposition of inorganic mercury in
2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid-treated rats lacking functional
multidrug-resistance protein 2.

In the present study, we evaluated the disposition of inorganic mercury (Hg(2+)) 
in sham-operated and 75% nephrectomized (NPX) Wistar and transport-deficient
(TR(-)) rats treated with saline or the chelating agent
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). Based on previous studies, DMSA and
TR(-) rats were used as tools to examine the potential role of
multidrug-resistance protein 2 (MRP2) in the disposition of Hg(2+) during renal
insufficiency. All animals were treated with a low dose (0.5 mumol/kg i.v.) of
mercuric chloride (HgCl(2)). At 24 and 28 h after exposure to HgCl(2), matched
groups of Wistar and TR(-) rats received normal saline or DMSA
(intraperitoneally). Forty-eight hours after exposure to HgCl(2), the disposition
of Hg(2+) was examined. A particularly notable effect of 75% nephrectomy in both 
strains of rats was enhanced renal accumulation of Hg(2+), specifically in the
outer stripe of the outer medulla. In addition, hepatic accumulation, fecal
excretion, and blood levels of Hg(2+) were enhanced in rats after 75%
nephrectomy, especially in the TR(-) rats. Treatment with DMSA increased both the
renal tubular elimination and urinary excretion of Hg(2+) in all rats. DMSA did
not, however, affect hepatic content of Hg(2+), even in the 75% NPX TR(-) rats.
We also show with real-time polymerase chain reaction that after 75% nephrectomy 
and compensatory renal growth, expression of MRP2 (only in Wistar rats) and
organic anion transporter 1 is enhanced in the remaining functional proximal
tubules. We conclude that MRP2 plays a significant role in the renal and corporal
disposition of Hg(2+) after a 75% reduction of renal mass.

A study of the subchronic effects of arsenic exposure on the liver tissues of
Labeo rohita using Fourier transform infrared technique.

In this work, an attempt has been made to study the subchronic effects of arsenic
exposure on the biochemical composition; mainly proteins of the liver tissues of 
Labeo rohita fingerlings by using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectroscopic technique. The study was carried out using a Perkin Elmer-Spectrum 
Rx1 spectrometer. Because of arsenic exposure, significant reductions in the
intensity as well as area of amide bands have been observed in the liver tissues.
The decreased intensity of the amide bands could be interpreted as the result of 
alteration of the protein synthesis due to the high affinity of metal compounds
towards different amino acid residues of proteins. Further, meso-2,
3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) treatment shows the recovery of the protein
content in the liver tissues. To confirm that the changes observed are only due
to the bio-accumulation of arsenic, the concentration of arsenic in the liver
tissues of Labeo rohita was determined by using Inductively Coupled
Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). It is observed that the arsenic
level in the control tissues is found to be below detectable limit, whereas the
arsenic exposed liver shows an accumulation of 66.68 ± 0.43 μg/g and DMSA
treatment reduces the arsenic content to 17.96 ± 0.19 μg/g. In conclusion, this
study gives clear evidence that the use of FT-IR spectroscopy is a powerful
approach to achieve more insight into the protein alterations caused by arsenic.

Acute mercury intoxication and use of chelating agents.

Boscolo M, Antonucci S, Volpe AR, Carmignani M, Di Gioacchino M.

There is a great hazard of mercury intoxication in the third world for artisanal 
miners using mercury as amalgam for extracting and refining gold. In developing
countries, there is the possibility of risk regarding exposure to Hg from amalgam
tooth fillings, ethyl-Hg (thimerosal) added as antiseptic to vaccines and
methyl-Hg in fish. In one case, a 41-year-old man attempted suicide by ingesting 
100 mg of HgCl2. After 8 hours, he developed hematemesis and entered the
intensive care unit; his urinary Hg was 10.1 mg/l. Treatment with
2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BAL) was started by intramuscular route after 16 hours at
the dosage of 5 mg/kg body weight every 4 hours on days 2-3 and 3 mg/kg every 6
hours on days 4-5 and then every 12 hours on days 6-14 without adverse side
effects. Acute Hg intoxication can be managed with BAL as first choice chelator, 
whereas the less toxic 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and
2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS) should be reserved for cases of less
severe inorganic Hg or methyl-Hg acute intoxication. Such agents, recommended
only for the treatment of acute Hg poisoning, should not be used for patients
suffering from neurological diseases in which environmental Hg exposure is
hypothesised.

Comparison of treatment protocols for removing metallic foreign objects from the 
ventriculus of budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus).

Lupu C(1), Robins S.

Author information: 
(1)Montreal Bird and Exotic Veterinary Hospital, 6090 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, 
QC H4A 1Y1, Canada.

To compare the efficacy of treatment protocols recommended to aid passage of
metallic foreign objects from the ventriculus of birds, a 1-mm metal sphere, made
from solder wire, was placed into the crop of each of 44 budgerigars
(Melopsittacus undulatus). After survey radiographs confirmed the spheres were
lodged in the ventriculus, birds were divided into 6 groups. Each group received 
1 of 6 different treatment protocols: psyllium with grit, acidic drinking water, 
fine grit, coarse grit, cathartic emollients (peanut butter and mineral oil), and
a control group. All birds were treated simultaneously with a chelating agent,
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), to prevent heavy-metal toxicosis. Successive
survey radiographs were used to monitor elimination of the spheres from the
digestive tract. Of all protocols tested, birds treated with either fine or large
grit had the shortest mean elimination time of the metal spheres. These results
indicate that administration of grit particles, either fine or coarse, appears to
be effective in hastening the passage of metallic foreign objects from the
ventriculus of budgerigars.

[Lead intoxication in a group of workers in Germany].

[Article in German]

HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: Seventeen East-European workers with a suspected 
lead-intoxication presented themselves to the Department of Toxicology. All of
them had worked on the renovation of pylons of a high-tension line. The old
paint, known to contain lead was removed with needle descalers. The patients had 
blood lead concentrations between 325 and 1124 microg/l, but no specific
symptoms. The workers neglected the protective measures at their working-place.
INVESTIGATIONS: 12 of 17 workers had lead-concentrations above 400 microg/l
(Reference < 90 microg/l). 10 of 17 patients showed an increased level of free
protoporphyrins and all workers showed a decreased activity of
delta-aminolaevulinacid-dehydratase (ALAD).
TREATMENT AND COURSE: Patients with lead-concentration above 700 microg/l were
treated with the chelating agent meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) 3 x 200 
mg/d for nine days. The patients with lead concentrations between 400 and 700
microg/l were treated which DMSA 3 x 100 mg/d. After the DMSA-treatment the
lead-concentrations had dropped (p < 0.001). During the DMSA-therapy one patient 
had to be treated in the hospital because of a generalised allergic exanthema.
CONCLUSION: We report seventeen patients with high lead concentration in their
blood due to occupational exposure. The high blood lead levels showed that the
workers had not been protected adequately. This examplifies that occupational
lead exposure still occurs, also in Germany. By patients with unspecific symptoms
connected with lead exposure a biomonitoring for lead is necessary.

Hidden high-grade vesicoureteral reflux is the main risk factor for chronic renal
damage in children under the age of two years with first urinary tract infection.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present prospective trial was to investigate, in a
cohort of young children with first urinary tract infection (UTI) and negative
prenatal history, the role of imaging in screening babies at risk of renal
deterioration.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children who had experienced the first febrile UTI at or
under the age of 2 years were enrolled. They had had normal foetal routine
ultrasound. All the children underwent renal ultrasound after admission; those
with sonographic signs of obstruction were excluded. Voiding cystoureterogram
(VCUG) and (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy were performed
approximately 1 month and 6 months after the UTI, respectively. Finally, 65
babies (47.7% males, 38.6 +/- 1.3 weeks of gestational age) were prospectively
followed up.
RESULTS: In 15.4% and 29.2% of cases, the renal pelvis was < or =7 and >7 mm in
diameter, respectively. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was detected in 55.4% of the 
children and renal scarring in 18.5%. Stepwise binary logistic regression
analysis showed that the severity of VUR correlated significantly with renal
scarring, excluding all the other variables from the model. In this cohort of
babies, the severity of VUR seriously enhanced the risk of renal damage (odds
ratio = 6.658, p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Follow-up renal scintigraphy 6 months after a UTI can predict severe 
VUR in very young children showing renal scarring, detecting only those who are
at risk of loss of kidney function and who would require further assessment.
After the first episode of UTI, the practice of performing VCUG in babies with
normal DMSA scintigraphy is of doubtful value.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the speed and precision of split renal volume (SRV)
measurement, which is the ratio of unilateral renal volume to bilateral renal
volume, using a newly developed software for computed tomographic (CT) volumetry 
and to investigate the usefulness of SRV for the estimation of split renal
function (SRF) in kidney donors.
METHOD: Both dynamic CT and renal scintigraphy in 28 adult potential living renal
donors were the subjects of this study. We calculated SRV using the newly
developed volumetric software built into a PACS viewer (n-SRV), and compared it
with SRV calculated using a conventional workstation, ZIOSOFT (z-SRV). The
correlation with split renal function (SRF) using (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy was
also investigated.
RESULTS: The time required for volumetry of bilateral kidneys with the newly
developed software (16.7±3.9s) was significantly shorter than that of the
workstation (102.6±38.9s, p<0.0001). The results of n-SRV (49.7±4.0%) were highly
consistent with those of z-SRV (49.9±3.6%), with a mean discrepancy of
0.12±0.84%. The SRF also agreed well with the n-SRV, with a mean discrepancy of
0.25±1.65%. The dominant side determined by SRF and n-SRV showed agreement in 26 
of 28 cases (92.9%).
CONCLUSION: The newly developed software for CT volumetry was more rapid than the
conventional workstation volumetry and just as accurate, and was suggested to be 
useful for the estimation of SRF and thus the dominant side in kidney donors.

Single photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) for functional investigation
of the proximal tubule in conscious mice.

Noninvasive analysis of renal function in conscious mice is necessary to optimize
the use of mouse models. In this study, we evaluated whether single photon
emission-computed tomography (SPECT) using specific radionuclear tracers can be
used to analyze changes in renal proximal tubule functions. The tracers included 
(99m)TC- dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA), which is used for cortex
imaging; (99m)Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine ((99m)Tc-MAG3), used for dynamic
renography; and (123)I-beta(2)-microglobulin, which monitors receptor-mediated
endocytosis. (99m)Tc-DMSA SPECT imaging was shown to delineate the functional
renal cortex with a approximately 1-mm spatial resolution and accumulated in the 
cortex reaching a plateau 5 h after injection. The cortical uptake of
(99m)Tc-DMSA was abolished in Clcn5 knockout mice, a model of proximal tubule
dysfunction. Dynamic renography with (99m)Tc-MAG3 in conscious mice demonstrated 
rapid extraction from blood, renal accumulation, and subsequent tubular
secretion. Anesthesia induced a significant delay in the (99m)Tc-MAG3 clearance. 
The tubular reabsorption of (123)I-beta(2)-microglobulin was strongly impaired in
the Clcn5 knockout mice, with defective tubular processing and loss of the native
tracer in urine, reflecting proximal tubule dysfunction. Longitudinal studies in 
a model of cisplatin-induced acute tubular injury revealed a correlation between 
tubular recovery and (123)I-beta(2)-microglobulin uptake. These data show that
SPECT imaging with well-validated radiotracers allows in vivo investigations of
specific proximal tubule functions in conscious mice.

Potential diagnostic role of renal scintigraphy in the management of patients
with high anorectal malformation.

and Research, Chandigarh, India.

Urological problems are the leading associated anomalies in patients with
anorectal malformation (ARM). In this study, we evaluated the role of
scintigraphy in managing patients with high ARM. The records of infants with
urologic anomalies on abdominal ultrasound and referred for scintigraphic
evaluation were retrospectively analyzed. Diuretic renography in these patients
was performed using (99m)Tc-diethyl triamine penta-acetic acid ((99m)Tc-DTPA) or 
(99m)Tc-ethylene cysteine ((99m)Tc-EC) while cortical scintigraphy was performed 
with (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA). Whenever available, EC was preferred in 
children of age less than 1 year. Forty patients (38 males, 2 females) were
analyzed. The mean age of the population was 25 months (range 15 days-21 years). 
Eighteen of the forty patients were less than 3 months of age. Twenty seven of
the patients were less than one year of age. The most common renal anomaly was
unilaterally non-visualized kidney affecting 15 out of the 40 patients. The
visualised kidney was abnormal in 8/15 patients. Hydronephrotic changes were
noticed in 12 of 40 patients of whom 2 had pelvi ureteric junction obstruction
that was confirmed and treated surgically. Horse shoe kidney was present in 1
patient while 2 had an ectopic kidney. Scarring/ pyelonephritic changes were
found in 7/40 patients. Five patients had already progressed to chronic renal
failure at the time of scintigraphy. Only 8 patients of the 40 had bilaterally
normal kidneys. In conclusion, this study suggests that urologic abnormalities
often found in infants with high ARM may remain clinically silent and eventually 
lead to chronic renal failure. Proper evaluation by diuretic renography and
cortical scintigraphy can lead to early identification of potentially treatable
conditions hence reducing the likelihood of developing severe renal damage.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and pattern of abnormal scintigraphy
findings in children with UTI and VUR.
METHODS: Data of 118 children who underwent micturating cystourethrography (MCU) 
and late Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan were evaluated. Findings were
categorized under the image appearance and relative kidney uptake (RKU) and
related to the grade of VUR, sex and child's age.
RESULTS: MCU revealed VUR (78 unilateral and 40 bilateral) of grades I, II, III, 
IV and V in 2, 47, 35, 19 and 15 patients respectively. There were 52 children
with normal and 66 with abnormal DMSA finding. Scarring rate was significantly
associated with high grade VUR (p=0.0023) and male gender ( p=0.0412). Bilateral 
scarring was seen exclusively in children with bilateral VUR. No significant
difference was found between renal scarring and child's age in the same gender
group. Poor kidney function was shown in 5 patients.
CONCLUSION: Renal scarring highly correlated with grade of VUR. A strategy to
perform MCU only on patients with abnormal DMSA finding is proposed.

Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal cortical scintigraphy (RCS) of a
46-year-old man with abdominal and right flank pain who had history of a tendency
toward thrombosis revealed extensive renal parenchymal changes secondary to renal
infarction and a small size defect in the right kidney in addition to the
patient's prior computed tomography results. The patient had Coumadin treatment. 
Two months later, he was referred to the hospital with the same symptoms. DMSA
RCS established that the small defect in the right kidney had enlarged; other
scarred areas persisted. This case indicates the value of DMSA RCS for early
diagnosis, follow-up of acute/recurrent renal parenchymal scarring in patients
with thrombophilia.

We report a high yielding synthesis of truly monodisperse, thiolate-protected
silver clusters via a rationally designed approach. The cluster composition was
determined by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry to be
Ag(7)(DMSA)(4), where DMSA represents meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid. The Ag(7)
thiolate clusters exhibit distinct optical properties. The approach developed in 
this work provides some insight into the cluster growth kinetics and may be
extendable to the synthesis of other sized silver nanoclusters.

Functional polymorphisms in transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGFbeta-1) and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) genes modify risk of renal parenchymal 
scarring following childhood urinary tract infection.

Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

BACKGROUND: The risk of renal scar formation following urinary tract infection
(UTI) varies markedly between individuals. We sought to investigate a possible
role of the common polymorphisms in the gene encoding for VEGF and TGFbeta-1, key
regulators of tissue repair, in renal scarring.
METHODS: Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed in 104 children (63 males) aged 2
months to 12 years by urine culture and 99Tc-DMSA renal scan. A follow-up isotope
scan was performed 4-6 months later to identify new renal scar formation.
Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was examined by micturating cystourethrogram.
Controls comprised 300 healthy children with no evidence of renal disease. Three 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TGFbeta-1 (-800 A/G, -509 C/T and
869 C/T) and four SNPs in the VEGF gene (-2578 C/A, -1154 G/A, -460 T/C and +405 
G/C) were genotyped in all subjects.
RESULTS: Forty-six of the 104 patients developed renal parenchymal scarring
(44.2%). VUR was found in 35.6%. The -509 T allele in the TGFbeta-1 promoter was 
significantly more common in cases with renal scarring (51%) than in non-scarring
patients (22.4%) and controls (23.6%) (both P < 0.0001). At the haplotype level, 
the GTC combination at -800/-509/+869 was strongly associated with renal scarring
(P = 0.0002). VEGF-460 CC was more common in UTI cases with renal scarring than
in non-scarring patients and controls (P = 0.03 and 0.001, respectively).
Multiple logistic regression testing identified the presence of VUR (odds ratio
12.4, CI 3.8-40; P < 0.001) and the TGFbeta-1 -509 T allele (OR 6.1, CI 2.4-15.5;
P < 0.001) as independent risk factors for renal scarring after UTI. In contrast,
age, gender and the type of underlying organism were not predictive of renal
scarring.
CONCLUSIONS: Activating variants in the TGFbeta-1 and VEGF gene promoters are
associated with post-UTI renal scar formation in children. The TGFbeta-1 509T
allele predicts renal scarring independent of VUR.

BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effects of oral dimercapto succinic acid 
(DMSA) therapy on the behavioural symptoms of children with autism spectrum
disorders (ASD) ages 3-8 years.
METHODS: Phase 1 involved 65 children with ASD who received one round of DMSA (3 
days). Participants who had high urinary excretion of toxic metals were selected 
to continue on to phase 2. In phase 2, 49 participants were randomly assigned in 
a double-blind design to receive an additional 6 rounds of either DMSA or
placebo.
RESULTS: The groups receiving one round and seven rounds of DMSA had significant 
improvements on all the assessment measures. For the seven round group, the
degree of improvement on the assessment measures could be partially explained by 
a regression analysis based on excretion of toxic metals and changes in
glutathione (adjusted R2 of 0.28-0.75, p < 0.02 in all cases). One round of DMSA 
had nearly the same benefit as seven rounds. The assessment measures correlated
reasonably with one another at the beginning of the study (r = 0.60-0.87) and
even better at the end of the study (r = 0.63-0.94).
CONCLUSION: Overall, both one and seven rounds of DMSA therapy seems to be
reasonably safe in children with ASD who have high urinary excretion of toxic
metals, and possibly helpful in reducing some of the symptoms of autism in those 
children.

BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effect of oral dimercapto succinic acid
(DMSA) therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders ages 3-8 years.
METHODS: Phase 1 involved 65 children who received one round of DMSA (3 days).
Participants who had high urinary excretion of toxic metals were selected to
continue on to phase 2. In phase 2, 49 participants were randomly assigned in a
double-blind design to receive an additional 6 rounds of either DMSA or placebo.
RESULTS: DMSA greatly increased the excretion of lead, substantially increased
excretion of tin and bismuth, and somewhat increased the excretion of thallium,
mercury, antimony, and tungsten. There was some increase in urinary excretion of 
essential minerals, especially potassium and chromium. The Phase 1 single round
of DMSA led to a dramatic normalization of RBC glutathione in almost all cases,
and greatly improved abnormal platelet counts, suggesting a significant decrease 
in inflammation.
CONCLUSION: Overall, DMSA therapy seems to be reasonably safe, effective in
removing several toxic metals (especially lead), dramatically effective in
normalizing RBC glutathione, and effective in normalizing platelet counts. Only 1
round (3 days) was sufficient to improve glutathione and platelets. Additional
rounds increased excretion of toxic metals.

A comparison of sodium calcium edetate (edetate calcium disodium) and succimer
(DMSA) in the treatment of inorganic lead poisoning.

Bradberry S(1), Vale A.

Author information: 
(1)West Midlands Poisons Unit, City Hospital, Birmingham, UK.

INTRODUCTION: This article reviews the experimental and clinical studies that
have compared the efficacy (impact on urine lead excretion, blood and tissue lead
concentrations, resolution of features and survival) of sodium calcium edetate
(edetate calcium disodium) and succimer (DMSA) in the treatment of inorganic lead
poisoning. It also summarizes the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects and
the adverse effects of treatment.
METHODS: Medline, Toxline, and Embase were searched for all available years to
June 2009. PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS: The absorption of oral DMSA is 
more complete than sodium calcium edetate; the latter has to be administered
parenterally. Both antidotes are distributed predominantly extracellularly.
Sodium calcium edetate is not metabolized, whereas DMSA is extensively
metabolized to mixed disulfides of cysteine. The two antidotes have elimination
half-lives of less than 60 min. There is no evidence that either antidote crosses
the blood-brain barrier to any major extent. Sodium calcium edetate chelates lead
by displacement of the central Ca2+ ion with Pb2+. The nature of the DMSA-lead
chelate is less clearly defined. There is evidence that the mixed disulfides of
cysteine are the active chelating moiety in humans. If this is the case, this
suggests that chelation occurs principally, if not exclusively, in the kidney.
The primary source of lead mobilized by sodium calcium edetate is bone with an
additional contribution from kidney and liver.
EFFICACY: Comparison of the experimental studies is complicated by substantial
variations in study design, particularly the antidote dose, the route and
duration of treatment, the amount and duration of lead dosing, and lack of direct
comparison between antidotes (comparison was usually made with control). In
experimental studies that used equimolar and clinically relevant antidote doses
and assessed the impact of DMSA and sodium calcium edetate on urine lead
excretion and/or blood lead concentrations, similar results were found, though no
direct comparison between antidotes was undertaken. DMSA was more effective than 
sodium calcium edetate in reducing the kidney lead concentration, sodium calcium 
edetate was more effective than DMSA in reducing bone lead concentrations, and
there was no consistently observed effect of chelation therapy on brain lead
concentrations in these experimental studies. Only two clinical studies have
compared equimolar or similar antidote doses in enhancing urine lead excretion;
there was no statistical difference between the antidotes, though both studies
had limitations. DMSA and sodium calcium edetate had a comparable impact on
lowering blood lead concentrations in a clinical study using similar molar
antidote doses.
ADVERSE EFFECTS: Sodium calcium edetate causes dose-related nephrotoxicity. Both 
agents deplete zinc and copper, the effect on zinc being significantly greater
with sodium calcium edetate. A transient increase in hepatic transaminase
activity has been reported with both antidotes but appears to be more common with
DMSA and neither has been associated with clinically significant hepatic
toxicity. Skin lesions during treatment with sodium calcium edetate are unusual
and have been attributed to zinc deficiency. DMSA has occasionally been
associated with a severe mucocutaneous reaction necessitating discontinuation of 
therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral DMSA and parenteral sodium calcium edetate are both effective
chelators of lead. There are currently insufficient data, however, to conclude
that either antidote is superior in enhancing lead excretion. Both antidotes
resolve the symptoms of moderate and severe lead toxicity rapidly. Although there
is greater clinical experience with sodium calcium edetate, particularly in the
treatment of lead encephalopathy, oral DMSA may now be considered as an
alternative in circumstances where oral therapy is preferable.

General Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Thrace, Greece.

OBJECTIVE: To determine by meta-analysis whether serum procalcitonin (PCT) is a
useful marker of acute renal parenchymal involvement (RPI) in children with
culture-proven urinary tract infection (UTI), as diagnosed by acute-phase DMSA
(Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid) renal scintigraphy.
STUDY DESIGN: We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials for prospective studies involving children with culture-proven UTIs.
Additional eligibility criteria were measurement of serum PCT at presentation and
performance of DMSA scintigraphy within 14 days.
RESULTS: Overall, 10 studies eligible for inclusion, involving a total of 627
children, were identified. Half of these studies evaluated children with a first 
episode of UTI; 8 involved children with febrile UTIs. Using a cutoff value of
0.5 to 0.6 ng/mL, the pooled diagnostic odds ratio of serum PCT for UTI with RPI 
was 14.25 (95% confidence interval, 4.70 to 43.23). High statistical
between-study heterogeneity that could mainly be attributed to 2 studies was
observed. The remaining 8 studies uniformly favored PCT use.
CONCLUSIONS: In children with culture-proven UTI, a serum PCT value >0.5 ng/mL
predicts reasonably well the presence of RPI, as evidenced by DMSA scintigraphy. 
PCT may aid in the identification of children with UTI, necessitating more
intense evaluation and management.

Magnetic nanoparticles surface-functionalized with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (MNPs-DMSA) constitute an innovative and promising approach for tissue- and 
cell-targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs in the lung. Transendothelial
migration of leukocytes in the lung is a side effect of endovenous administration
of MNPs-DMSA. Using cytologic and phenotypic analysis of murine bronchoalveolar
lavage cells, we identified monocytes/macrophages as the main subpopulation of
leukocytes involved in this process. Moreover, ultrastructural analysis revealed 
the presence of nanoparticles inside of numerous macrophages from bronchoalveolar
lavage. MNPs-DMSA at concentrations as high as 1 x 10(15) nanoparticles/mL had no
toxic effects on macrophages, as evidenced by 3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Notably,
MNPs-DMSA up-regulated the mRNA expression of E-, L- and P-selectin and
macrophage-1 antigen in the murine lung. Upregulation of these cell adhesion
molecules was associated with an increased concentration of tumor necrosis
factor-alpha in lung. Finally, the critical relevance of the beta(2)
integrin-dependent pathway in leukocyte transmigration elicited by MNPs-DMSA was 
demonstrated by use of knockout mice. Our results characterize mechanisms of the 
pro-inflammatory effects of MNPs-DMSA in the lung, and identify beta(2)
integrin-targeted interventions as promising strategies to reduce pulmonary side 
effects of MNPs-DMSA during biomedical applications.

A recently proposed electroanalytical method, using differential pulse
voltammetry (DPV) on the rotating Au-disk electrode, and electrospray ionization 
mass-spectrometry (ESI-MS) has been applied to study the binding of the
pharmaceutical chelating agents meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), sodium
2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfate (DMPS) and D-penicillamine (D-Pen) with Hg(2+). From
the use of voltammetric titrations it was possible to obtain a detailed picture
of the complexation processes at concentrations much lower than in previous
studies. Predominant species were Hg(Pen)(2), Hg(2)(DMSA)(2) and Hg(DMPS)(2). For
Pen, Hg(Pen) was also deduced from DPV data, while Hg(2)(Pen)(4) from ESI-MS. For
DMSA and DMPS, Hg(2)L species were detected by DPV, and Hg(2)L(3), Hg(3)L(3) as
well as Hg(2)(DMPS)(2) and Hg(DMSA)(2) by ESI-MS. When possible, DPV data were
analyzed by multivariate curve resolution with alternating least squares
(MCR-ALS).

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated different factors predicting the development of acute 
pyelonephritis in Iranian children, with special attention to time factor.
METHODS: One hundred nineteen patients (93 females and 26 males; age = 32.6 ±
30.8 months) with first urinary tract infection (UTI) were evaluated. None had
previous urological problems. Prior to antibiotic therapy blood samples were
gathered for laboratory evaluation. Vital signs on admission were measured.
Clinical and laboratory indices, including therapeutic delay time (TDT) and
therapeutic response time (TRT), were measured. Most patients were evaluated with
renal ultrasound in the first three days following admission. All patients
underwent dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy and 71 were assessed 
for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
RESULTS: DMSA scans were abnormal in 77 cases, of which 11 cases had bilateral
renal involvement. Mean values for TDT, TRT, leukocyte count (LC), absolute
neutrophil count (ANC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive
protein (CRP) were 74.1 h, 39.6 h, 15725 ± 6682 mm(-3), 10772 ± 6458 mm(-3), 51.9
± 32.5 mm, and 27.3 ± 25.1 mg l(-1), respectively. VUR was present in 29 of 142
evaluated renal units.
CONCLUSION: TDT ≥ 48 h, TRT ≥ 24 h, axillary temperature ≥ 39°C, LC ≥ 13500
mm(-3), and age ≥ 18 months predicted abnormal DMSA scan in patients with first
episode of UTI. Considerably higher TDT and TRT values of the current study
compared to previous ones suggests the more important role of time factor in
predicting abnormal DMSA findings in a developing country than in developed ones.

Arsenic is a naturally occurring element that is ubiquitously present in the
environment. High concentration of naturally occurring arsenic in drinking water 
is a major health problem in different parts of the world. Despite arsenic being 
a health hazard and a well documented carcinogen, no safe, effective and specific
preventive or therapeutic measures are available. Among various recent strategies
adopted, administration of an antioxidant has been reported to be the most
effective. The present study was designed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of
monoisoamyl dimercaptosuccinic acid (MiADMSA), administered either individually
or in combination with taurine post chronic arsenic exposure in rats. Arsenic
exposed male rats (25 ppm, sodium arsenite in drinking water for 24 weeks) were
treated with taurine (100 mg/kg, i.p., once daily), monoisoamyl
dimercaptosuccinic acid (MiADMSA) (50 mg/kg, oral, once daily) either
individually or in combination for 5 consecutive days. Biochemical variables
indicative of oxidative stress along-with arsenic concentration in blood, liver
and kidney were measured. Arsenic exposure significantly reduced blood
delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity, a key enzyme involved in
the heme biosynthesis and enhanced zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) level. Clinical
hematological variables like white blood cells (WBC), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH),
and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) showed significant decrease with a 
significant elevation in platelet (PLT) count. These changes were accompanied by 
significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and increased
catalase activity. Arsenic exposure caused a significant decrease in hepatic and 
renal glutathione (GSH) level and an increase in oxidized glutathione (GSSG).
These biochemical changes were correlated with an increased uptake of arsenic in 
blood, liver and kidney. Administration of taurine significantly reduced hepatic 
oxidative stress however co-administration of a higher dose of taurine (100
mg/kg) and MiADMSA provided more pronounced effects in improving the antioxidant 
status of liver and kidney and reducing body arsenic burden compared to the
individual treatment of MiADMSA or taurine. The results suggest that in order to 
achieve better effects of chelation therapy, co-administration of taurine with
MiADMSA might be preferred.

Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum (SG) is an intracellular pathogen of
chickens. To survive, to invade and to multiply in the intestinal tract and
intracellularly it depends on its ability to produce energy in anaerobic
conditions. The fumarate reductase (frdABCD), dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)-trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) reductase (dmsABC), and nitrate reductase
(narGHIJ) operons in Salmonella Typhimurium (STM) encode enzymes involved in
anaerobic respiration to the electron acceptors fumarate, DMSO, TMAO, and
nitrate, respectively. They are regulated in response to nitrate and oxygen
availability and changes in cell growth rate. In this study mortality rates of
chickens challenged with mutants of Salmonella Gallinarum, which were defective
in utilising anaerobic electron acceptors, were assessed in comparison to group
of bird challenged with wild strain. The greatest degree of attenuation was
observed with mutations affecting nitrate reductase (napA, narG) with additional 
attenuations induced by a mutation affecting fumarate reductase (frdA) and a
double mutant (dmsA torC) affecting DMSO and TMAO reductase.

A liposome system that can detect and detoxify mercury in aqueous solution is
demonstrated. The system consists of
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and 20% PEG-PE (PEG MW 2000 Da)
that forms liposome, which encapsulates self-quenching fluorescein for detection,
and chelating agent meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (meso-DMSA) for chelating
detoxification through Hg(2+)-responsive release of fluorescein and meso-DMSA.
This system can detect mercury levels as low as 10 nM with high selectivity. In
particular, the release profile of meso-DMSA by the local concentration of Hg can
be modulated, so that more chelators are released in regions of high
concentration and less chelators are released in regions of low concentration.
The design has been demonstrated both in vitro and in HeLa cells. This "budgeted"
release profile is particularly useful in situations in which the local levels of
Hg contamination vary, or if such contamination is time dependent.

Arsenic contamination of groundwater in the West Bengal basin in India is
unfolding as one of the worst natural geo-environmental disasters to date.
Chelation therapy with chelating agents is considered to be the best known
treatment against arsenic poisoning; however, they are compromised with certain
serious drawbacks/side-effects. Efficacy of combined administration of Moringa
oleifera (M. oleifera) (English: Drumstick tree) seed powder, a herbal extract,
with a thiol chelator monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA) post-arsenic exposure in mice
was studied. Mice were exposed to 100 ppm arsenic in drinking water for 6 months,
followed by 10-days treatment with M. oleifera seed powder (500 mg/kg, orally
through gastric gavage, once daily), MiADMSA (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, once
daily) either individually or in combination. Arsenic exposure caused significant
decrease in blood glutathione, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD),
accompanied by increased production of reactive oxygen species in blood and soft 
tissues. Significant inhibition of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and
glutathione peroxidase activities in tissues (liver in particular) along with
significant increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and
metallothionein levels in arsenic intoxicated mice was also noted. Combined
administration of MiADMSA with M. oleifera proved better than all other
treatments in the recovery of most of the above parameters accompanied by more
pronounced depletion of arsenic. The results suggest that concomitant
administration of M. oleifera during chelation treatment with MiADMSA might be a 
better treatment option than monotherapy with the thiol chelator in chronic
arsenic toxicity.

To investigate the effects of mercury species intoxication and to test the
efficiency of different commonly applied antidotes, human whole blood and plasma 
surrogate samples were spiked with inorganic mercury (Hg2+) and methylmercury
(MeHg+, CH3Hg+) prior to treatment with the antidotes 2,3-dimercaptopropan-1-ol
(British Anti Lewisite), 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), and N-acetylcysteine
(NAC). For mercury speciation analysis in these samples, liquid chromatography
was coupled to either inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or
electrospray ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS). Adduct
formation between mercury species and physiological thiols (cysteine and
glutathione) was observed as well as the release of glutathione under treatment
with the antidotes DMSA and NAC.

It has been shown that garlic and its main bioactive component, allicin, as
natural chelating agents can reduce blood and tissue lead content in animal
models. In this study the effect of allicin, alone or combined with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), in decreasing lead content of blood and 
tissues of mice was evaluated. Swiss albino mice were exposed to 1000 ppm of lead
in water for 35 days and then placed in various treatment groups including groups
administered oral allicin, DMSA, or their combination. The concentrations of lead
in blood, kidney, liver, bone and brain were measured using atomic absorption
spectrophotometry. Both, allicin and DMSA decreased the blood and tissue lead
concentration. There was an additive effect of the combined administration of
allicin and DMSA in reducing bone lead. No side effect was observed in all
treated groups. Combined use of DMSA and allicin seems to be a better choice in
the treatment of chronic lead intoxication.

We studied the ability of pre- and postcaptopril renal scintigraphy to predict
renovascular disease (RVD) in children. Retrospective review of medical notes and
radiology reports of all hypertensive children who had had both pre- and
postcaptopril renal scintigraphy with [(99m)Tc] dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
and/or [(99m)Tc] mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) and digital subtraction
angiography (DSA). 81 children aged 1-18 (median 10) years were studied with 62% 
(51) having a diagnosis of RVD. Main renal artery disease, intrarenal disease,
and both main and intrarenal artery disease were present in 25, 14, and 12
patients respectively. The isotope study accurately diagnosed RVD, confirmed by
DSA, in 47% (24 of 51) children, with eight false positive studies. The
sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the
isotope study to predict RVD were 48%, 73%, 76%, and 51%, respectively. Pre- and 
postcaptopril renal scintigraphy was unable to predict RVD in children.

Five cases of severe vesico-ureteric reflux in a family with an X-linked
compatible trait.

Vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) is one the most common inherited disorder in humans.
Even though this defect is common among siblings and parents of index patients
(27-40%), the mode of inheritance is not well defined. Parents and siblings
(three female and two male) of a 13-year-old girl with end-stage renal failure
(ESRF) due to reflux nephropathy were screened for VUR although they had not
presented episodes of urinary tract infection. VUR was identified in the father
(44 years old) and in all the three sisters (aged 15 years, 16 years and 18
years) while the two brothers (aged 5 years and 8 years) had normal renal
ultrasonograms and cystograms. A technetium-99m di-mercapto-succinic acid
((99m)Tc-DMSA) scan demonstrated renal scars in the father and in two of the
sisters with VUR. No episodes of urinary infection had been documented for any
relatives. Haplotype analysis on the X-chromosome confirmed paternity. This is
the first description of VUR compatible with an X-dominant trait. This mode of
inheritance must be added to what is already known on familial VUR, and future
studies should also consider this possibility.

Use of oral dimercaptosuccinic acid (succimer) in adult patients with inorganic
lead poisoning.

Bradberry S(1), Sheehan T, Vale A.

Author information: 
(1)West Midland Portion Unit, City Hospital, University of Birmingham,
Birmingham, B18 7QH, UK.

BACKGROUND: Chelation therapy has been used as a means of reducing the body
burden of lead for five decades. Intravenous sodium calcium edetate has been the 
preferred agent, but there is increasing evidence that dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) is also a potent chelator of lead.
METHODS: Oral DMSA 30 mg/kg/day was administered to adults with blood lead
concentrations > or = 50 microg/dl. The impact of DMSA on urine lead excretion,
on blood lead concentrations and on symptoms was observed. The incidence and
severity of adverse effects was also recorded.
RESULTS: Thirty-five courses were given to 17 patients. DMSA significantly (P <
0.0001) increased urine lead excretion and significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced
blood lead concentrations. Mean daily urine lead excretion exceeded the
pre-treatment value by a median of 12-fold with wide variation in response (IQR
8.9-14.8, 95% CI 10.1-14.6). Pre-treatment blood lead concentrations correlated
well with 5-day urine lead excretion. Headache, lethargy and constipation
improved or resolved in over half the patients within the first 2 days of
chelation. DMSA was generally well tolerated, but one course was discontinued due
to a severe mucocutaneous reaction. There was a transient increase in alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) activity during 14% of chelations. DMSA caused a
significant increase in urine copper (P < 0.0001) and zinc (P < 0.05) excretion.
CONCLUSION: Oral DMSA 30 mg/kg/day is an effective antidote for lead poisoning,
though there is a wide inter- and intra-individual variation in response.

The role of serum and urine interleukin-8 on acute pyelonephritis and subsequent 
renal scarring in children.

BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)-8 acts as a potent neutrophils chemoattractant
responsible for the migration of neutrophils into the infected renal tissue to
protect against invading pathogens. The aim of this study was to assess the role 
of IL-8 on acute-phase pyelonephritis and later renal scarring in children.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 124 children with a first-time febrile urinary
tract infection (UTI) were studied. The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis was
confirmed by Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan. Serum and urine
samples were obtained from 124 children with UTI and 20 healthy children for IL-8
measurement.
RESULTS: The 124 children were divided into acute pyelonephritis (n = 70) and
lower UTI (n = 54) groups according to the results of DMSA scans. The initial
serum and urine IL-8 values of children with acute pyelonephritis were
significantly higher when compared with lower UTI and healthy controls (all P <
0.001). Renal scarring was seen in 26 (38.8%) of these 67 children with acute
pyelonephritis at follow-up DMSA scans. Both the initial serum and urine IL-8
concentrations were significantly higher in children with renal scarring than in 
those without (both P < 0.001). The mean age of children with renal scarring was 
also significantly lower than those without scarring (P = 0.004). Multivariate
analysis showed that the highest initial IL-8 values, age <20 months and reflux
grades > or =III all were independent predictors of renal scarring.
CONCLUSIONS: Those children younger than 2 years of age with the highest IL-8
concentrations during the acute phase of pyelonephritis as well as children with 
reflux grades of III or greater are at a high-risk for developing renal scarring 
in the future.

[Dosimetry in scintimammography by (99m)Tc-MIBI, (99m)Tc-Tetrofosmin,
(99m)Tc-(V)DMSA and 201TlCl compared with X-rays mammography].

[Article in Greek, Modern]

Lyra M, Vamvakas I.

Scintimammography is sometimes referred as a complementary diagnostic method to
X-rays mammography and is the optimum examination for some patients to check
suspected breast tumors. A dosimetric comparison of these diagnostic examinations
is important. Estimation of the absorbed dose was achieved by calculations of
internal dosimetry by Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) models and by
calculations from the patients' scintigraphic images data using the MIRDOSE 3
program. The aim of this work was to compare the absorbed dose in
scintimammography to that of X-rays mammography. Our results showed, that the
breast absorbed dose by scintimammography examination using technetium-99m
((99m)Tc) complexes, 1.28mGy for (99m)Tc (V)-DMSA, 1.57mGy for (99m)Tc- MIBI and 
1.92mGy for (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin, is considerably lower than the absorbed dose by 
scintimammography with thallium-201 chloride ((201)Tl-Cl) which reaches the
4.52mGy, or the absorbed dose by X-rays mammography. The absorbed mean glandular 
dose (MGD) for breast by X-rays mammography, taking 2 projections per breast, may
reach 4.5mGy and is much higher for dense or large breasts. The European
guidelines for quality assurance in breast cancer screening and diagnosis (2006, 
4th edition) include a desirable level of less than 2.0mGy and an acceptable
level of less than 2.5mGy for MGD for pressed breast thickness 4.5cm, per
projection. In many radiology laboratories, specific care for every patient's
radiation protection rules may reduce the MGD up to 1.4mGy per projection. Breast
absorbed MGD in scintimammography by (99m)Tc-complexes mentioned above is reduced
to more than half the above mentioned values for the examined breast and
significantly lower than these levels for the not-examined breast. The radiation 
burden during scintimammography is also, many times lower than that of other
radiology examinations including, lumbar spine radiography and pyelography. In
conclusion, scintimammography is a low dose diagnostic method, and having also a 
high sensitivity, may be used as a complementary screening test in cases of dense
breasts or breasts after surgery or breasts with prostheses, decreasing the
necessity for breast biopsies.

Prone retroperitoneoscopy in treating complex renal vascular malformations.

Hennayake S(1).

Author information:

Kingdom. supul.hennayake@cmft.nhs.uk

INTRODUCTION: Two children presented with malignant hypertension due to complex
reno-vascular malformations. The 7-min video shows the use of prone
retroperitoneoscopy in both. PATIENT 1: A 6-year-old girl presented with
convulsions and malignant hypertension. Captopril DMSA was suggestive of right
renal artery stenosis. On formal angiography, the kidney was perfused by what
appeared to be an arterio-venous malformation. The renal artery was hypoplastic
and there were pulsatile vessels along the ureter due to the gonadal periureteric
and gonadal inferior capsular collateral supply to the kidney. The kidney could
be devascularized easily by controlling these. PATIENT 2: A 14-month-old boy
presented with 6-month history of poor appetite, weight loss and irritability.
Formal angiography showed acute obstruction of the main upper pole branch. The
vessels to the upper pole could be clearly seen and controlled at surgery for
partial right nephrectomy. He recovered with no urine leak or bleeding.
CONCLUSION: Gravity kept the renal vessels under stretch allowing excellent
two-hand dissection and the space was adequate for suture closure of a calyx in
Case 2. The prone approach provides excellent exposure of the renal blood
vessels, aorta and vena cava, and seems to be the most suitable for complex renal
vascular malformations.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (succimer; DMSA) in inorganic lead poisoning.

Bradberry S(1), Vale A.

Author information: 
(1)West Midlands Poisons Unit, City Hospital, Birmingham, UK.

INTRODUCTION: This article reviews data on the efficacy of succimer
(dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA) in the treatment of human inorganic lead
poisoning, the adverse effects associated with its use, and summarizes current
understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects.
METHODS: Medline, Toxline, and Embase were searched and 912 papers were
identified and considered. PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS: DMSA is
absorbed rapidly but incompletely after oral administration, probably through an 
active transporter. There is evidence that enterohepatic circulation occurs. Most
DMSA in plasma is protein (mainly albumin)-bound through a disulfide bond with
cysteine; only a very small amount is present as free drug, which is filtered at 
the glomerulus then extensively reabsorbed into proximal tubule cells.
Nonfiltered protein-bound DMSA in peritubular capillaries is also available for
uptake into proximal tubule cells by active anion transport at the basolateral
membrane. DMSA therefore accumulates in the kidney where it is extensively
metabolized in humans to mixed disulfides of cysteine. Some 10-25% of an orally
administered dose of DMSA is excreted in urine, the majority within 24 h and most
(>90%) as DMSA-cysteine disulfide conjugates. It is not known whether
protein-bound DMSA can chelate lead; there is evidence that the mixed disulfides 
of cysteine are the active chelating moiety in humans. If this is the case, this 
suggests that chelation occurs principally, if not exclusively, in the kidney.
DOSE: DMSA 30 mg/kg/day is more effective than either 10 or 20 mg/kg/day in
enhancing urine lead excretion. DURATION OF THERAPY: Initial clinical studies
with DMSA involved the administration of a 5-day course of treatment.
Subsequently, a 19- to 26-day regimen was introduced with the intent of
preventing or at least blunting a rebound in the blood lead concentration.
Studies suggest, however, that repeated courses of DMSA 30 mg/kg/day for at least
5 days are equally efficacious if a treatment-free period of at least 1 week
between courses is included to allow redistribution of lead from bone to soft
tissues and blood. There is also evidence that in more severely poisoned patients
DMSA 30 mg/kg/day can be given for more than 5 days with benefit.
EFFICACY: DMSA 30 mg/kg/day significantly increases urine lead elimination and
significantly reduces blood lead concentrations in lead-poisoned patients, though
there is substantial individual variation in response. Over a 5-day course, mean 
daily urine lead excretion exceeds baseline by between 5- and 20-fold and blood
lead concentrations fall to 50% or less of the pretreatment concentration, with
wide variation. Maximum enhancement of urine lead elimination typically occurs
with the first dose. Most symptomatic patients report improvement after 2 days of
treatment. However, DMSA did not improve cognition in children < 3 years old with
mild lead poisoning, presumably because lead-induced neurological damage occurred
during development in utero and/or early infancy. DMSA IN PREGNANCY AND IN THE
NEONATE: DMSA is not teratogenic but did produce maternal toxicity (decreased
weight gain) and fetotoxicity when given in high dose (100-1,000 mg/kg/day) in
experimental studies. For this reason sodium calcium edetate is generally
preferred in pregnancy.
ADVERSE EFFECTS: A transient modest rise in transaminase activity during
chelation occurs in up to 60% of patients but has not resulted in clinically
significant sequelae. Skin reactions occur in approximately 6% of treated
patients and are occasionally severe. DMSA also increases urine copper and zinc
excretion but not to a clinically important extent.
CONCLUSIONS: DMSA is an effective lead chelator that primarily chelates renal
lead. It is generally well tolerated but may occasionally cause clinically
important adverse effects. DMSA may now be considered as an alternative to sodium
calcium edetate, particularly when an oral antidote is preferable.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively whether normal scintigraphic results during 
urinary tract infections (UTIs) in neonates were predictive of the absence of
dilating vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (grade > or =III) and permanent renal damage
(PRD).
METHODS: Term neonates with a first symptomatic, community-acquired UTI
participated in the study. Urinary tract ultrasonography and
technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy were
performed within 72 hours after diagnosis and voiding cystourethrography within 1
to 2 months. DMSA scintigraphy, to determine the development of PRD, was repeated
6 months after UTI.
RESULTS: Seventy-two neonates (144 renal units) were enrolled. Acute
pyelonephritis was diagnosed through early DMSA scintigraphy in 19% of renal
units, VUR in 22%, and grade > or =III VUR in 13%. The majority (71%) of renal
units with grade > or =III VUR had normal early DMSA scintigraphic results. The
sensitivity and specificity of abnormal early DMSA scintigraphic results to
predict grade > or =III VUR were 29% (95% confidence interval: 11%-55%) and 82%
(95% confidence interval: 74%-88%), respectively. PRD was found in 7% of renal
units, all of which had abnormal early DMSA scintigraphic results. PRD was
significantly more frequent among renal units with grade > or =III VUR than among
nonrefluxing renal units (P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Normal early DMSA scintigraphic results for neonates with
symptomatic UTIs were helpful in ruling out later development of PRD but were not
predictive of the absence of dilating VUR. To rule out dilating VUR, voiding
cystourethrography may be required.

Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a protein identified in
human neutrophil granules. The aim of the study was to assess whether urine level
of NGAL (uNGAL) could represent a novel, reliable marker of urinary tract
infection (UTI) and to determine the optimal cutoff level for uNGAL to predict
UTI in children. Sixty patients with symptomatic UTI and 29 healthy controls were
enrolled the study. Urine NGAL was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
A dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) radionuclide scan was performed within 7 days in
the patients with UTI in an attempt to distinguish pyelonephritis from cystitis. 
Mean uNGAL level was significantly higher in the UTI group than in the controls
(91.02 ng/ml vs 14.29 ng/ml, p = 0.0001) and using a cutoff 20 ng/ml for uNGAL
for diagnosis of UTI, sensitivity, and specificity were 97% and 76%, respectively
[area under the curve (AUC): 0.979]. Mean uNGAL/creatinine ratio (uNGAL/Cr) was
also significantly higher in the UTI group [201.81 ng/mg creatinine (Cr) vs 18.08
ng/mg Cr; p = 0.0001], and using a cutoff 30 ng/mg Cr for uNGAL/Cr for diagnosis 
of UTI, sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 76%, respectively (AUC: 0.992). 
In conclusion, both uNGAL and uNGAL/Cr can be used as a novel, sensitive marker
for early prediction of UTI in the absence of acute kidney injury and chronic
kidney disease, and the optimal cutoff value for prediction of UTI is lower than 
the values determined for acute kidney injury. Further investigations with larger
patient groups are required to confirm our results.

Variants of fibrinogen A alpha-chain (AFib) cause the most common type of
hereditary renal amyloidosis in Europe and, possibly, the United States as well. 
Variant fibrinogen is produced in the liver, and solitary renal allografts fail
within 1 to 7 years with recurrent amyloidosis. We assessed 22 AFib patients for 
combined liver and kidney transplantation (LKT) and report the clinical features 
and outcome. Twenty-one had E526V and 1, the R554L variant. Coronary
atherosclerosis was identified in 68% and systemic atheromatosis in 55%. Vascular
atheroma excised at endarterectomy and endomyocardial biopsies contained purely
variant fibrinogen amyloid. Half had autonomic neuropathy. Six of 9 patients who 
underwent LKT are alive (67%), with good allograft function and no amyloidosis at
median 67 months (range, 33-155 months) of follow-up. Serial
technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy 
in 2 cases of preemptive LKT demonstrated preserved native kidney residual
function at 5 years. Four explanted livers were used successfully for domino
transplantation. Fibrinogen amyloidosis is a systemic amyloid disease with
visceral, vascular, cardiac, and neurologic involvement. LKT is curative;
however, cardiovascular amyloidosis may preclude this option. Our data encourage 
evaluation of preemptive solitary liver transplantation early in the course of
amyloid nephropathy to prevent hemodialysis and kidney transplantation.

OBJECTIVE: Renal cortical scintigraphy with (99m)Tc dimer captosuccinic acid
(DMSA) is the standard method to detect acute pyelonephritis and cortical
scarring. Different acquisition methods have been used: planar parallel-hole or
pinhole collimation and single photon emission tomography (SPECT). Publications
support the superiority of each; few comparative studies have been reported, with
mixed results. We have compared planar parallel-hole cortical scintigraphy and
dual-head SPECT for detection of cortical defects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients (37 children, 3 adults; 9 male, 31 female) 
were imaged 3 hours after injection of (99m)Tc-DMSA with dual-head SPECT and
planar imaging (posterior, left, and right posterior oblique views with a
parallel-hole collimator). For each patient, planar and SPECT images were
evaluated at different sittings, in random order, by three independent observers.
Twelve cortical segments were scored as normal or reduced uptake. The linear
correlation coefficient for the number of abnormal segments detected between
readers, techniques, and segments was calculated.
RESULTS: No significant difference was seen in the average number of abnormal
segments detected by planar versus SPECT imaging; 2.1 for planar imaging and 2.2 
for SPECT (p = 0.84, two-tailed). For all observers, the average correlation
coefficient for SPECT alone, planar imaging alone, and between techniques (SPECT 
vs planar imaging) was high (r = 0.93-0.94). Applying nonparametric Spearman's
rank analysis, the average correlation remained high (r = 0.70-0.75). Correlation
between readers, techniques, and segments for methods and readers was also good
(r = 0.69-0.77).
CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-DMSA renal cortical imaging using dual-head SPECT offers no
statistically significant diagnostic advantage over planar imaging for detection 
of cortical defects.

OBJECTIVE: Current imaging recommendations for investigating any infantile
febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) are ultrasound scan (US), micturating
cystourethrogram (MCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. The aim of this 
retrospective cohort study was to determine the need and indications for MCUG in 
the investigation of a first febrile infantile UTI, as doubts have been raised
over its benefit.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Information on 427 infants who had undergone US, MCUG and
DMSA following a first febrile UTI was prospectively recorded. The infants were
divided into two groups: A (354) with normal renal US and B (73) with abnormal
US. DMSA findings were correlated with findings on MCUG. Main outcome measures
were incidence of recurrent UTIs, change in management or intervention as a
result of MCUG, and outcome at discharge.
RESULTS: Only 21/354 (6%) infants in Group A had both scarring on DMSA and
vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), predominantly low-grade on MCUG. In Group B
(abnormal US), 23/73 (32%) had scarring on DMSA and vesicoureteric reflux,
predominantly high grade on MCUG. Of the infants with non-scarred kidneys, 73%
had dilating reflux. Successful conservative treatment was performed in 423
infants, and 4 infants in Group B required surgery.
CONCLUSION: We recommend US and DMSA in all infantile febrile UTI cases. Where US
is normal, MCUG should be reserved for those cases with abnormal DMSA. Where US
is abnormal, MCUG should be performed irrespective of findings on DMSA scan. A
randomized prospective study is necessary to evaluate this further.

Effect of DMPS and DMSA on the placental and fetal disposition of methylmercury.

Methylmercury (CH3Hg+) is a serious environmental toxicant. Exposure to this
metal during pregnancy can cause serious neurological and developmental defects
in a developing fetus. Surprisingly, little is known about the mechanisms by
which mercuric ions are transported across the placenta. Although it has been
shown that 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) and 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) are capable of extracting mercuric ions from various organs and
cells, there is no evidence that they are able to extract mercury from placental 
or fetal tissues following maternal exposure to CH3Hg+. Therefore, the purpose of
the current study was to evaluate the ability of DMPS and DMSA to extract
mercuric ions from placental and fetal tissues following maternal exposure to
CH3Hg+. Pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to CH3HgCl, containing [203Hg], on day 
11 or day 17 of pregnancy and treated 24 h later with saline, DMPS or DMSA.
Maternal organs, fetuses, and placentas were harvested 48 h after exposure to
CH3HgCl. The disposition of mercuric ions in maternal organs and tissues was
similar to that reported previously by our laboratory. The disposition of
mercuric ions in placentas and fetuses appeared to be dependent upon the
gestational age of the fetus. The fetal and placental burden of mercury increased
as fetal age increased and was reduced by DMPS and DMSA, with DMPS being more
effective. The disposition of mercury was examined in liver, total renal mass,
and brain of fetuses harvested on gestational day 19. On a per gram tissue basis,
the greatest amount of mercury was detected in the total renal mass of the fetus,
followed by brain and liver. DMPS and DMSA reduced the burden of mercury in liver
and brain while only DMPS was effective in the total renal mass. The results of
the current study are the first to show that DMPS and DMSA are capable of
extracting mercuric ions, not only from maternal tissues, but also from placental
and fetal tissues following maternal exposure to CH3Hg+.

Lead, a ubiquitous and potent neurotoxicant causes oxidative stress which leads
to numerous neurobehavioral and physiological alterations. The ability of lead to
bind sulfhydryl groups or compete with calcium could be one of the reasons for
its debilitating effects. In the present study, we addressed: i) if chelation
therapy could circumvent the altered oxidative stress and prevent neuronal
apoptosis in chronic lead-intoxicated rats, ii) whether chelation therapy could
reverse biochemical and behavioral changes, and iii) if mono or combinational
therapy with captopril (an antioxidant) and thiol chelating agents (DMSA/MiADMSA)
is more effective than individual thiol chelator in lead-exposed rats. Results
indicated that lead caused a significant increase in reactive oxygen species,
nitric oxide, and intracellular free calcium levels along with altered behavioral
abnormalities in locomotor activity, exploratory behavior, learning, and memory
that were supported by changes in neurotransmitter levels. A fall in membrane
potential, release of cytochrome c, and DNA damage indicated
mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Most of these alterations showed significant
recovery following combined therapy with captopril with MiADMSA and to a smaller 
extend with captopril+DMSA over monotherapy with these chelators. It could be
concluded from our present results that co-administration of a potent antioxidant
(like captopril) might be a better treatment protocol than monotherapy to counter
lead-induced oxidative stress. The major highlight of the work is an interesting 
experimental evidence of the efficacy of combinational therapy using an
antioxidant with a thiol chelator in reversing neurological dystrophy caused due 
to chronic lead exposure in rats.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the physiopathological mechanisms in perinatal renal vein 
thrombosis and the associated risk factors, with emphasis on the clinical and
radiological characteristics and on the long-term evolution.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied a total of 11 cases of neonatal 
renal vein thrombosis; the mean age of patients at diagnosis was 3 days. We
analyzed the type of presentation, the clinical manifestations, and the findings 
at B-mode and Doppler ultrasonography, as well as the treatment undertaken and
the long-term sequelae.
RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, the triad of a palpable mass, unequivocal
hematuria, and thrombocytopenia was present in only 63.63% of patients. A
prothrombotic risk factor was identified in the newborn or mother in 45.45% of
cases. At ultrasonographic examination, all newborns had enlarged kidneys and in 
all cases it was impossible to differentiate between the renal cortex and the
renal medulla. In 4 of the 11 cases, hyperechogenic intramedullary linear images 
characteristic of the initial stage of thrombosis were identified. Functional
follow-up studies using DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) and MAG-3
(mercaptoacetyltriglycine acid) revealed morphological abnormalities in all
patients; 7 patients had a nonfunctioning kidney.
CONCLUSIONS: Visualizing echogenic bands within the medulla should alert
radiologists to the initial phase of renal vein thrombosis and enable the
appropriate treatment to be administered. With the exception of cases discovered 
before birth, renal vein thrombosis has a poor prognosis, with atrophy and renal 
failure in the long term.

The efficacy of ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid scan in predicting
vesicoureteral reflux in children below the age of 2 years with their first
febrile urinary tract infection.

We evaluated the efficacy of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and ultrasound
(US) in comparison with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in predicting
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children below the age of 2 years. Medical records
and radiologic studies of children (<2 years) suffering their first febrile
urinary tract infection (UTI) between January 2001 and May 2007 were
retrospectively reviewed. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive
and negative predictive values of US and DMSA scans in diagnosing VUR. Among 220 
children with their first febrile UTI, VUR was detected in 67 (30.4%). The
detection rate of VUR by US was 41.7% and 86% in the low (I, II) and high grade
(III~IV) groups, respectively. Detection rate of VUR by DMSA scan was 37.5% and
88.4% in the low and high grade groups, respectively. Combining US and DMSA scan,
we found that the detection rate of high grade VUR was 95.3% and that of low
grade was 62.5%. During follow up, most of the low grade VURs with normal DMSA
and US scans resolved or were downgraded. Most high grade VURs could be detected 
by US and DMSA scan, but the prediction rate was not as high in low grade VURs.
However, we can anticipate spontaneous improvement without complications in
patients with either low or high grade reflux and negative findings on US and
DMSA scan.

The aim of the study reported here was to determine whether kidney scarring after
urinary tract infections (UTI) in children can be prevented and to identify the
risk factors for developing scars. We identified children in the Northern health 
region of the UK who had been seen to develop scars, identified as new defects on
dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scanning. Risk factors were sought by reviewing
case-notes and interviews with parents. Twenty girls were identified whose new
scarring was strongly associated with having both vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and
a UTI (p = 0.0001); 19/23 (83%) of kidneys exposed to both of these factors
developed scars. Children were much more likely to be febrile (94 vs. 30%, p <
0.0001) or unwell (82 vs. 10%, p < 0.0001) during their earlier UTIs when they
were of median age 2.8 years (range 0.3-5.0 years) and did not scar, compared to 
their later UTIs at age 7.3 years (1.2-12.5 years), when they did scar. However, 
most patients were treated within 1 day of their symptoms for their early UTIs,
compared to a wait >or=7 days for later UTIs (p = 0.001). Being febrile or unwell
during a UTI does not predict the development of scars, but prompt treatment
appears to prevent scarring in children with VUR.

OBJECTIVE: Partial or complete duplication of the renal tract may be an
incidental finding or may be associated with significant pathology. Accurate
assessment is not always easy. This retrospective review was undertaken to
determine whether intravenous urography (IVU) in combination with a DMSA renal
scan provides significant additional information.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients referred to our imaging department with a
provisional diagnosis on ultrasound of renal tract duplication during a three
year period were identified by searching the radiological computer files. The
presenting features were urinary infection (13), abdominal pain (3) and abnormal 
antenatal sonography (2).
RESULTS: Four patients were found not to have renal duplication. There was
concordance between the IVU and DMSA scan in seven. Additional clinically
relevant information was obtained in three cases. A false negative result from
the DMSA scan was found in four children and a false positive result in three.
CONCLUSION: In a significant number of cases of possible renal tract duplication,
additional relevant information can be obtained from an IVU. Patient distress is 
minimised by combining the IVU and DMSA in one single episode of venous access.
Review of the radiological images during the investigation allows minimisation of
radiation dosage.

Although technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) renal scans are
widely used to evaluate renal tubular mass function, the mechanism by which renal
uptake of DMSA occurs is still the subject of debate. Patients with various
proximal tubular disorders show markedly decreased renal DMSA uptake, even when
there is normal creatinine clearance. We measured the renal uptake of
(99m)Tc-DMSA 3 h after its injection in 13 patients with Dent disease or Lowe
syndrome, both of which are typical proximal tubular disorders with defective
megalin and cubilin-mediated endocytosis. Serial images of three patients were
also obtained at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 h post-injection. The correlations between renal
uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA and creatinine clearance and the degrees of acidemia and
tubular proteinuria were then evaluated. The renal uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA was
markedly decreased in all patients, and the decreased uptake was detected in all 
serial images. In contrast, bladder radioactivity was higher than normal in all
of the serial images when compared to renal radioactivity. Additionally, the
uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA was inversely proportional to the amount of urine
beta(2)-microglobulin. These results strongly suggest that DMSA is filtered in
the glomeruli and subsequently undergoes megalin- and cubilin-mediated
endocytosis in the proximal tubules.

Easy route to functionalize iron oxide nanoparticles via long-term stable thiol
groups.

The functionalization of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) by
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was investigated. Under ambient
conditions, the thiol groups from DMSA are not stable and do not allow a direct
functionalization without storage in stringent conditions or a chemical
regeneration of free thiols. In this study, we have developed a protocol based on
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) grafting of SPIO prior to DMSA anchoring. We have
observed that PEG helps to increase the stability of thiol groups under ambient
conditions. The thiol functionalized SPIOs were stable under physiological pH and
ionic strength as determined by Ellman's essay and allowed us to graft a thiol
reactive fluorescent dye: tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TMRM).

University, Nanjing 210096, PR China.

We synthesized three types of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MNPs), which
were meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) coated MNPs (DMSA@MNPs, 17.3+/-4.8
nm, negative charge), chitosan (CS) coated MNPs (CS@MNPs, 16.5+/-6.1 nm, positive
charge) and magnetic nanoparticles agglomerates, formed by electronic aggregation
between DMSA@MNPs and CS (CS-DMSA@MNPs, 85.7+/-72.9 nm, positive charge)
respectively. The interactions of these MNPs with Oral Squamous Carcinoma Cell KB
were investigated. The results showed that cellular uptakes of MNPs were on the
dependence of incubation time, nanoparticles concentration and nanoparticles
properties such as surface charge, size, etc. The cellular uptake was enhanced
with the increase of incubation time and nanoparticles concentration. Although
all MNPs could enter to cells, we observed apparent differences in the magnitude 
of nanoparticles uptaken. The cellular uptake of CS-DMSA@MNPs by KB cells was the
highest and that of DMSA@MNPs was the lowest among the three types of MNPs. The
same conclusions were drawn via the reduction of water proton relaxation times
T(2)(*), resulting from the different iron load of labeled cells using a 1.5T
clinical MR imager. The finding of this study will have implications in the
chemical design of nanomaterials for biomedical applications.

Medicine, Shanghai Institute for Pediatric Research, Shanghai Key Laboratory of
Children's Environmental Health, Shanghai 200092, China.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of chelation therapy with succimer (DMSA) in
male rabbits of moderate lead poisoning during juvenile stage.
METHODS: Twenty-four 45-day-old male New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided
into three groups (therapy group, TG; positive control group, PG and negative
control group, NG, n=8). The TG and PG were orally exposed to lead acetate (5 mg 
x kg(-1) x d(-1)) for 6 weeks. Rabbits in TG were orally supplied DMSA 1050 mg/m2
in the first week and 700 mg/m2 in the next two weeks, while the other two groups
wren't blood and urinary samples of all rabbits were collected per week. The
tissues and organs of all rabbits were collected after 12 weeks. The blood lead
levels (BLLs) were determined by atomic absorption spectrometer. The urine lead
levels and the lead contents of tissue and organ were determined by inductively
coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Histopathology of tissue and organ was observed
by light microscope.
RESULTS: Compared with PG, the lead level in the morning urine of TG with DMSA
chelating was increased significantly. The level was peaked at (1246.96 +/-
157.91) microg/L on the first day after chelating. While the base line was (40.97
+/- 1.77) microg/L before chelating. Meanwhile, the BLLs were sharply declined
from (429.63 +/- 10.82) microg/L to (238.50 +/- 11.82) microg/L. The urine lead
levels of TG decreased through the 3-week chelating and 3-week discontinuation.
The urine lead levels of these two groups were significantly different
(F=2934.35, P<0.01). Compared to each two groups in these three groups, there
were significant difference (P<0.01). The authors found the reversion of BLLs in 
first week after stop chelating. The BLLs of PG presented the slow course of
declining in the same time, were (135.50 +/- 7.09) microg/L, very close to the
level of TG for (149.88 +/- 11.39) microg/L. Compared with treatment
discontinuation for 3 weeks, the urine lead levels and the body weight gain of
the therapy group increased more than that of PG, and the BLLs and the lead
concentrations in tissues and organs decreased more than that of PG, and
histopathology in the liver tissues and testicle tissues were improved.
CONCLUSION: DMSA chelating for the rodent models of moderate lead poisoning might
reduce the BLLs and soft tissue lead contents quickly and effectively, decrease
toxic effects of lead in a short period of time, thus alleviate the impairment of
lead poisoning on tissues and organs by decreasing lead burden, and bring out
improvement on the growth retardation caused by lead poisoning.

Evaluation of lead body burden in occupational workers by lead mobilization test.

Khan DA(1), Qayyum S, Saleem S, Khan FA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, AM College NUST, Rawalpindi.

OBJECTIVE: To determine total lead body burden by the Lead mobilization test
(LMT) by measuring 4 hours urinary lead excretion in the lead exposed as compared
to unexposed industrial workers after administration of 10 mg/Kg of
dimercaptosuccinic acid and correlate it with blood lead levels, at Wah district 
Rawalpindi.
METHODS: Total 149 males consisting of 87 lead exposed workers and 62 controls
were included. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 10mg/kg body weight, was
administered orally. Four hours urine specimens before and after DMSA
administration were collected. Blood lead levels (BLL) were determined on 3010B
ESA lead analyzer and urinary lead was measured on atomic absorption analyst 800 
(Perkin Elmer).
RESULTS: The lead exposed workers had high BLL median (range) 291 (90-611) ug/L
as compared to controls 108 (10-310) ug/L (p=0.01). The occupational workers also
revealed high DMSA-chelated urinary lead excretion (DMSA Pb-U) median (range) 28 
(1.7-268) ug/4h as compared to controls 6 (1-27) ug/4h (p<0.01). Four hours DMSA 
Pb-U was significantly correlated with BLL (r=0.67), baseline Pb-U (r=0.54) and
DMSA Pb-U/creatinine ratio (r=.81) in the lead exposed group (p<0.001). Increased
lead exposure was detected in 43% of the subjects by using the WHO criteria for
BLL while 54% were identified with LMT. Thirteen (15%) lead exposed workers had
BLL more than OSHA permissible limits.
CONCLUSION: Lead mobilization test is a more reliable diagnostic test than BLL
for assessment of toxicologically active fraction of total lead body burden and
imminent health risks in occupational workers.

Mechanism of thiol-supported arsenate reduction mediated by
phosphorolytic-arsenolytic enzymes: II. Enzymatic formation of arsenylated
products susceptible for reduction to arsenite by thiols.

Enzymes catalyzing the phosphorolytic cleavage of their substrates can reduce
arsenate (AsV) to the more toxic arsenite (AsIII) via the arsenolytic substrate
cleavage in presence of a reductant, as glutathione or dithiotreitol (DTT). We
have shown this for purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP),
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), glycogen phosphorylase-a (GPa),
and phosphotransacetylase (PTA). Using a multidisciplinary approach, we explored 
the mechanism whereby these enzymes mediate AsV reduction. It is known that PNP
cleaves inosine with AsV into hypoxanthine and ribose-1-arsenate. In presence of 
inosine, AsV and DTT, PNP mediates AsIII formation. In this study, we incubated
PNP first with inosine and AsV, allowing the arsenolytic reaction to run, then
blocked this reaction with the PNP inhibitor BCX-1777, added DTT and continued
the incubation. Despite inhibition of PNP, large amount of AsIII was formed in
these incubations, indicating that PNP does not reduce AsV directly but forms a
product (i.e., ribose-1-arsenate) that is reduced to AsIII by DTT. Similar
studies with the other arsenolytic enzymes (GPa, GAPDH, and PTA) yielded similar 
results. Various thiols that differentially supported AsV reduction when present 
during PNP-catalyzed arsenolysis (DTT approximately dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic 
acid > mercaptoethanol > DMSA > GSH) similarly supported AsV reduction when added
only after a transient PNP-catalyzed arsenolysis, which preformed
ribose-1-arsenate. Experiments with progressively delayed addition of DTT after
BCX-1777 indicated that ribose-1-arsenate is short-lived with a half-life of 4
min. In conclusion, phosphorolytic enzymes, such as PNP, GAPDH, GPa, and PTA,
promote thiol-dependent AsV reduction because they convert AsV into arsenylated
products reducible by thiols more readily than AsV. In support of this view,
reactivity studies using conceptual density functional theory reactivity
descriptors (local softness, nucleofugality) indicate that reduction by thiols of
the arsenylated metabolites is favored over AsV.

In this descriptive study of radionuclide cystography, time-activity curves were 
generated from renal pelves with reflux and evaluated to reveal the physiology of
the reflux. The generated new parameters were also evaluated for any correlation 
with the frequency of urinary tract infections and renal scarring.METHODS:
Thirty-two children with reflux to the renal pelvis (36 refluxing units) were
included. Regions of interest were drawn on the pelves and bladder, and
time-activity curves were generated. The first reflux phase, the bladder volume
at first reflux, and the bladder volume at maximal reflux were defined, and
reflux percentages were calculated. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy
findings and urinary tract infections were used for correlation.
RESULTS: New curves from the renal pelvis during bladder filling and bladder
emptying were generated and their patterns classified. Episodic reflux to the
pelvis was observed on time-activity curves, which demonstrated 4 different
emptying patterns during voiding. These patterns were described in detail.
Visually, residual activity was present in the renal pelves in 58.8% of patients.
The mean number of urinary tract infections per year was 1.07 (range, 0-4; SD,
0.88). The DMSA findings were normal in 57.1% of the patients.
CONCLUSION: We obtained and categorized some new time-activity curve patterns
from renal pelves with reflux on radionuclide cystography. Discussing these
patterns may help physicians understand the physiology of the reflux and the
relationship between infections and reflux.

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the applicability of the selective
approach of imaging infants < 6 months old with urinary tract infection (UTI)
according to the UTI guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence (NICE) 2007. Infants < 6 months old with their first UTI from January 
2001 to December 2006 having undergone an ultrasound examination of the urinary
tract, a micturating cystourethrogram, and a late di-mercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scan, were included. Their condition was evaluated against a set of risk features
according to the UTI guidelines. Those having any one of these were classified as
atypical and those having none as typical. There were 134 infants reviewed, with 
a typical (98 infants) to atypical (36 infants) ratio of 2.7 to 1. Girls were
found to be relatively more represented in the atypical group [male (M):female
(F) = 1.3:1] than in the typical group (M:F = 4.4:1) (P < 0.004). There were
significantly more infants with abnormal micturating voiding cystourethrograms
(MCUGs) (P = 0.007), more refluxing ureters (P < 0.001) and more significant
vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) (>/= grade III) (P = 0.013) in the atypical group
than in the typical group; while there was no significant difference in
ultrasound (US) and DMSA scan findings between the two groups. In the atypical
group there was no difference in imaging studies (and, thus, the results) between
the conventional practice and the NICE UTI recommendation. In the typical group, 
if the recommendations of the guidelines had been followed (i.e. only those with 
abnormal US would have been further investigated), 25 refluxing ureters and 22
scarred kidneys would have been left undiagnosed. In conclusion, application of
the suggested selective imaging approach would leave a significant number of VUR 
and renal scars undiagnosed, and it may not be an optimal practice for infants
less than 6 months old with their first UTI. The best approach remains to be
clarified.

Iron oxide nanoparticles modified with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),
were encapsulated with a natural polymer with abundant primary amino groups,
chitosan (CS), to improve their biocompatibility. Characterization was performed 
using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetirc analysis,
transmission electron microscope analyses, vibrating sample magnetometer, zeta
potential analyzer. It was found that highly ordered spherical aggregates with a 
mean diameter of 98 nm are obtained. The formation of aggregates depended on
cross-linking of acrylic acid (AA) monomers and CS. These biodegradable CS-PAA
polymer magnetic nanospheres might be useful for various biomedical applications.

OBJECTIVES: To study the possible mechanism of the technetium-99m complex of
dimercaptosuccinic acid 99mTc(V)-DMSA accumulation in a model of Staphylococcus
aureus-induced bacterial arthritis regulated by glucose.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After making the S. aureus-induced bacterial arthritis
model, 14 rabbits were divided into two groups randomly, with one group receiving
6 g/kg 30% glucose administration. Then all the rabbits were injected with 74 MBq
99mTc(V)-DMSA. Whole-body single photon emission computed tomography was applied 
at different time points. The change of blood pH after blood glucose was also
assayed. The percentage of residual activity was evaluated over time in multiple 
regions of interest, including the inflammatory joint lesions and the
contralateral normal joints. Regional joint tissue pH was measured with a needle 
probe at different times after injecting glucose solution. Forty-two rabbits were
divided into six groups to assay the percentage injected dose.
RESULTS: 99mTc(V)-DMSA showed a noticeable osteotropic character in bone
pathologies. There was no influence of biodistribution of 99mTc(V)-DMSA by
glucose loading, but the glucose loading remarkably increased the uptake levels
of 99mTc(V)-DMSA in inflammatory joint lesions. A peak difference in
glucose-loaded lesion/normal uptake was observed after 6 h. The pH values of the 
inflammatory joints were noticeably lower than those of the normal joints of the 
contralateral legs.
CONCLUSION: The increased lesion uptake and tissue acidification in the
glucose-loaded group supports the hypothesis that glucose acidosis increases DMSA
uptake in bacterial arthritis, as has been observed in tumors.

Author information: 
(1)Divisions of Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, Imam Khomeini Hospital,
Tehran, Iran.

To identify the frequency of voiding dysfunction in patients with functional
constipation, dysfunctional voiding soring system (DVSS) was surveyed in 85
patients with functional constipation. Urinalysis, culture and renal ultrasound
were performed in all cases. If the child had urinary tract infection, voiding
cystourethrography and DMSA scan were performed. Fifty four patients (63.5%) out 
of 85 had voiding dysfunction (DVSS score above 6 in females and above 9 in
males) compared to 28 out of 280 normal children (10%) in control group
(P<0.001). Voiding dysfunction symptoms should be examined carefully in patients 
with functional constipation.

tract infection.

(1)Department of Pediatric Radiology, Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, The
Sahlgrenska Academy at Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.

AIM: To evaluate the ability of ultrasound (US) in infants (<1 year) with acute
urinary tract infection (UTI), to identify those with permanent renal damage
(PRD) at scintigraphy 1 year later.
METHODS: US, dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy and voiding cystourethrography 
were performed in 191 infants.
RESULTS: US was abnormal in 46 infants (24%). PRD was found in 46 infants (24%); 
19 of these had abnormal US (sensitivity 41%). In 145 infants without PRD, 27 had
abnormal US (specificity 81%). Dilating reflux or verified obstruction occurred
in 21 (11%) infants, of whom 18 (86%) had PRD while 28 of 170 (16%) without such 
diagnoses had PRD. Of 16 infants with dilating reflux, 9 (sensitivity 56%) had
abnormal US and 14 (88%) PRD. Dilatation at US was seen in 27 children; 7 of
these had dilating reflux and 5 verified obstruction.
CONCLUSION: US performed in association with acute UTI had limited ability to
identify children with PRD at (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) 1 year
later, although abnormal renal size was a strong indicator of renal damage. The
ability of US to identify children with dilating reflux was also limited.
However, once detected at US, dilatation of the urinary tract was associated with
dilating reflux or obstruction in half of the cases. Our study confirms that
dilating reflux and obstruction are strong indicators of PRD but only half of
those who developed PRD had such diagnoses.

Arsenic is a naturally occurring, highly toxic environmental pollutant. Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is a non-disturbing technique which
provides quantitative information about the molecular composition of biological
samples. The aim of this work is to study the compositional and structural
changes at the molecular level occurring in gill tissues of Labeo rohita
fingerlings due to arsenic exposure for various exposure periods by using FT-IR
spectroscopic technique. The results of the present study suggest that arsenic
exposure causes significant changes on the major biochemical constituents such as
proteins, lipids and nucleic acids in the gill tissues of L. rohita. The changes 
are more pronounced as the period of exposure is increased. The significant
decrease in the intensity and area of the amide I peak and CH(3) asymmetric
stretching band suggests an alteration in the protein profile and lipid levels
respectively, due to arsenic exposure. The amide A peak shifts suggests a change 
in the level of protein amide hydrogen bonding due to arsenic exposure. Further, 
the treatment with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) improves the levels of
biochemical constituents significantly, which suggest that DMSA treatment reduces
the toxic effects and helps the recovery of gill tissues and its return to the
level of the control.

Republic of China, Tianjin 300191, China.

2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is an orally effective chelating agent for the
treatment of heavy metal poisoning. The increasing therapeutic use of DMSA has
stimulated the need for sensitive and selective methods for its determination in 
biological samples, as well as study on pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution.
According to the previously reported method, an improved method was established
for the determination of DMSA in mice blood and tissues, in which oxidized DMSA
was reduced by the disulfide-reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), and DMSA was
converted to a highly fluorescent and stable derivative by reaction with
monobromobimane (mBBr) in alkaline solution. Acetonitrile was used for
deproteinization and dichloromethane was used for condensation and purification, 
which significantly shortened the amount of time used to process the sample.
Meanwhile isocratical elution was performed and excellent separation of the DMSA 
derivative was obtained, this enabled a run finish within 20 min. The limits of
quantitation were 0.025 microg/ml in brain and 0.1 microg/ml in blood, lung,
heart, intestine, liver, spleen and kidney, respectively. The calibration curves 
were linear in all samples (r(2)>0.992) with a range of 0.025-1.6 microg/ml for
brain homogenate and 0.1-6.4 microg/ml for blood and homogenates of lung, heart, 
intestine, liver, spleen and kidney, respectively. Therefore, the method is
simple, rapid and sensitive, and it could be applicable to the studies in an
animal model to evaluate the distribution of DMSA in blood and tissues.

Multicystic dysplastic kidney in children--a need for conservative and long term 
approach.

Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 160012, India.

OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively studied our cases of Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney 
(MCDK). The review was aimed at identifying the pattern of the disease in Indian 
Scenario and the required management thereof.
METHODS: We studied the clinical, radiological and nuclear scan findings of 22
patients with unilateral MCDK. They were diagnosed and/or treated in our unit
from 1999 to 2007. The diagnosis was achieved by Ultrasound and further confirmed
by DMSA scans. Other ancillary investigations like Micturating cystourethrogram
were done if indicated. These patients were followed and followup investigations 
consisted of renal ultrasound, blood pressure measurement, and urinalysis and
blood biochemistry
RESULTS: A total of 22 patients (18 boys and 4 girls) with unilateral MCDK were
investigated and followed for a mean period of 41 months. MCDK was detected on
antenatal ultrasound only in 12(55%) and postnatally in 10(45%) babies. Mean age 
for postnatal diagnosis was 20 months. Follow up ultrasound revealed complete
involution of MCDK in 3 patients and partial regression in 11 patients. The size 
of dysplastic kidney was unchanged in 4 patients and a further 4 patients
underwent nephrectomy. Indications of nephrectomy were parental anxiety in 2,
hypertension in 1 and palpable mass in 1.
CONCLUSION: Large proportion (45%) of patients in presented series are diagnosed 
post natally contrary to western world where more than 80% are diagnosed
antenatally. Uncomplicated isolated MCDK carry good prognosis with nephrectomy
required in only a few patients. Association with other urological anomalies in
ipsilateral/contralateral genitourinary tract is important to identify as they
have worse outcome in terms of ultimate renal function. All patients with
simple/complex unilateral MCDK should be advised long term follow up for the
possible development of hypertension and/or hyper infiltration injury.

OBJECTIVE: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease entity in children, 
and a number of imaging options are offered for these patients. The purpose of
our study was to retrospectively describe the (99m)Tc-labeled dimer captosuccinic
acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy, ultrasound, and micturating cystourethrography
(MCU) findings over a 9-year period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All children younger than 10 years old who presented to a 
local hospital in Hong Kong between July 1, 1997, and June 30, 2006, with
culture-confirmed UTI and who subsequently underwent DMSA scintigraphy,
ultrasound, and MCU were identified. For the purpose of this study, patients with
underlying major congenital urinary tract abnormalities were excluded. DMSA
scintigraphy was regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of renal
scarring. DMSA scintigraphy, ultrasound, and MCU findings and clinical outcomes
were reviewed and analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 583 children were included in the study. Of these, 432
children (74.1%) had normal findings on ultrasound and on MCU. Only 13 children
(3%) of this group had renal scarring as shown on DMSA scintigraphy. The overall 
negative predictive value (NPV) for excluding renal scarring of combined
ultrasound and MCU reached 97%. The NPV was 97.7% in the subgroup of patients 0
to 2 years old.
CONCLUSION: For children younger than 2 years with UTI in the absence of
underlying major congenital urinary tract abnormalities, we recommend that DMSA
scintigraphy may be withheld if findings on both ultrasound and MCU examinations 
are normal.

Effect of nanoparticle and aggregate size on the relaxometric properties of MR
contrast agents based on high quality magnetite nanoparticles.

Colloidal dispersions of monodispersed and high-crystalline magnetite
nanoparticles have been used to establish a relationship between magnetic
properties and magnetic resonance (MR) relaxometric parameters in vitro.
Magnetite nanoparticles with diameters between 4 and 14 nm were synthesized by
thermal decomposition of Fe(acac)3 in different organic solvents and transformed 
to hydrophilic by changing oleic acid for dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). A final
treatment in alkaline water was critical to make the suspension stable at pH 7
with xi-potential values of -45 mV and hydrodynamic sizes as low as 50 nm.
Samples showed superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature, which is an
important parameter for biomedical applications. Susceptibility increased with
both particle and aggregate size, and for particles larger than 9 nm, the
aggregate size was the key factor controlling the susceptibility. Relaxivity
values followed the same trend as the suspension susceptibilities, indicating
that the aggregate size is an important factor above a certain particle size
governing the proton relaxation times. The highest relaxivity value, r2=317 s(-1)
mM(-1), much higher than those for commercial contrast agents with similar
hydrodynamic size, was obtained for a suspension consisting of 9 nm particles and
70 nm of hydrodynamic size, and it was assigned to the higher particle
crystallinity in comparison to particles prepared by coprecipitation. Therefore, 
it can be concluded that in addition to the sample crystallinity, both particle
size and aggregate size should be considered in order to explain the magnetic and
relaxivity values of a suspension.

Neuroendocrine tumors can originate almost everywhere in the body and consist of 
a great variety of subtypes. This paper focuses on molecular imaging methods
using nuclear medicine techniques in neuroendocrine tumors, coupling molecular
uptake mechanisms of radiotracers with clinical results. A non-systematic review 
is presented on receptor based and metabolic imaging methods. Receptor-based
imaging covers the molecular backgrounds of somatostatin, vaso-intestinal peptide
(VIP), bombesin and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors and their link with nuclear
imaging. Imaging methods based on specific metabolic properties include
meta-iodo-benzylguanide (MIBG) and dimercapto-sulphuric acid (DMSA-V)
scintigraphy as well as more modern positron emission tomography (PET)-based
methods using radio-labeled analogues of amino acids, glucose,
dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), dopamine and tryptophan. Diagnostic sensitivities 
are presented for each imaging method and for each neuroendocrine tumor subtype. 
Finally, a Forest plot analysis of diagnostic performance is presented for each
tumor type in order to provide a comprehensive overview for clinical use.

The redox enzyme maturation proteins play an essential role in the proofreading
and membrane targeting of protein substrates to the twin-arginine translocase.
Functionally, the most thoroughly characterized redox enzyme maturation protein
to date is Escherichia coli DmsD (EcDmsD). Herein, we present the X-ray crystal
structure of the monomeric form of the EcDmsD refined to 2.0 A resolution, with
clear electron density present for each of its 204 amino acid residues. The
structural data presented here complement the biochemical data previously
generated regarding the function of these twin-arginine translocase leader
peptide binding chaperone proteins. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation
experiments were used to provide a proposed model for how this chaperone is able 
to recognize the leader peptide of its substrate DmsA. The interactions observed 
in the model are in agreement with previous biochemical data and suggest intimate
interactions between the conserved twin-arginine motif of the leader peptide of
E. coli DmsA and the most conserved regions on the surface of EcDmsD.

The aim of this study was to test our hypothesis that the urinary excretion of
C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1-microglobulin (A1M), retinol-binding protein
(RBP) and Clara cell protein (CC16) is increased in children with urinary tract
infection (UTI) and relates to renal damage as measured by acute
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Fifty-two children <2 years of age
with UTI were enrolled in the study, 44 of whom were febrile. The control group
consisted of 23 patients with non-UTI infection and elevated serum CRP (s-CRP)
levels. Thirty-six patients had abnormal DMSA uptake, classified as mild,
moderate or severe damage (DMSA class 1, 2, 3, respectively). There was a
significant association between DMSA class and the excretion of urinary RBP
(u-RBP) and u-CC16. There was also a significant difference in u-CRP levels
between children with UTI and control children with non-UTI infections, although 
u-CRP excretion was not significantly correlated to DMSA class. In conclusion,
the urinary excretion of the low-molecular-weight proteins RBP and CC16 showed a 
strong association with uptake defects on renal DMSA scans. The urinary level of 
CRP seems to distinguish between children with UTI and other febrile conditions. 
A combination of these biomarkers may be useful in the clinical assessment of
children with UTI.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is, using
technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA), to evaluate the decrease
of renal function caused by warm ischemia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The (99m)Tc-DMSA scan was performed before and 1, 3 and 6
months after the operation for 19 consecutive patients. The patients were divided
into three groups by warm ischemic time (group A: <or=40 min, B: >40 min
intersection <or=60 min, C: >60 min). Renal function of the unresected part was
defined as the uptake to unresected part relative to the uptake to the
contralateral kidney. The reduction of renal function was expressed as a ratio of
the function after the surgery divided by function before the surgery and was
compared between the three groups.
RESULTS: The reduction in group C after 1 and 3 months tended to be greater than 
that in group A or B, although not reaching statistical significance (one-way
ANOVA test, 1 month: p = 0.15 and 3 months: p = 0.13). There was a significant
difference in reduction of renal function between the three groups after 6 months
(one-way ANOVA test, p = 0.02). The Scheffé test showed a statistical
significance between groups A and C (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Renal function calculated by (99m)Tc-DMSA shows that prolonged
ischemic time causes significant damage to the kidney.

PURPOSE: To compare two methods of reconstructing technetium 99m (99mTc)
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal single photon emission computed tomographic 
(SPECT) data--ordered subset expectation maximization with three-dimensional
resolution recovery (OSEM-3D) and filtered back projection (FBP)--in children in 
terms of improving image quality and reducing the radiopharmaceutical activity
and radiation dose.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective
study and waived the requirement for informed patient consent. Fifty sequential
pediatric patient 99mTc-DMSA SPECT studies of 98 kidneys were retrospectively
analyzed by using a dual-detector gamma camera. FBP reconstruction with data from
both detectors was compared with OSEM-3D reconstruction with half the gamma
photon counts (ie, data from only one detector). Two nuclear medicine physicians 
blinded to the patients' medical histories and reconstruction techniques
evaluated the studies. Scores for image quality, renal size, and relative
function were compared by using paired t tests. Total scores for renal cortical
defects were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The kappa
coefficient was calculated as an indicator of the concordance between the OSEM-3D
and FBP reconstruction methods.
RESULTS: Image quality was significantly enhanced with OSEM-3D (P < .001, paired 
t test). Cortical defects were identified better on OSEM-3D images than on FBP
images. Of the 98 kidney SPECT studies analyzed, 19 showed identical cortical
defects and 75 showed none at both OSEM-3D and FBP. In four kidneys, OSEM-3D
depicted cortical defects that were not seen with FBP. No significant difference 
in relative renal function between the two methods was observed (P = .973).
CONCLUSION: Compared with FBP, OSEM-3D yielded superior image quality in the
evaluation of 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT data, with the potential for markedly
reduced radiation doses and/or shorter scanning times for patients.

Resistance of Haemophilus influenzae to reactive nitrogen donors and gamma
interferon-stimulated macrophages requires the formate-dependent nitrite
reductase regulator-activated ytfE gene.

Haemophilus influenzae efficiently colonizes and persists at the human
nasopharyngeal mucosa, causing disease when it spreads to other sites. Nitric
oxide (NO) represents a major antimicrobial defense deployed by host cells in
locations colonized by H. influenzae during pathogenesis that are likely to vary 
in oxygen levels. Formate-dependent nitrite reductase regulator (FNR) is an
oxygen-sensitive regulator in several bacterial pathogens. We report that fnr of 
H. influenzae is required for anaerobic defense against exposure to NO donors and
to resist NO-dependent effects of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-activated murine
bone marrow-derived macrophages. To understand the mechanism of resistance, we
investigated the role of FNR-regulated genes in defense against NO sources.
Expression analysis revealed FNR-dependent activation of nrfA, dmsA, napA, and
ytfE. Nonpolar deletion mutants of nrfA and ytfE exhibited sensitivity to NO
donors, and the ytfE gene was more critical for survival. Compared to the
wild-type strain, the ytfE mutant exhibited decreased survival when exposed to
macrophages, a defect that was more pronounced after prior stimulation of
macrophages with IFN-gamma or lipopolysaccharide. Complementation restored
survival of the mutant to the level in the parental strain. Increased sensitivity
of the ytfE mutant relative to that of the parent was abrogated by treatment of
macrophages with a NO synthase inhibitor, implicating YtfE in resistance to a
NO-dependent pathway. These results identify a requirement for FNR in positive
control of ytfE and indicate a critical role for ytfE in resistance of H.
influenzae to reactive nitrogen species and the antibacterial effects of
macrophages.

Arsenic poisoning remains a therapeutic challenge, and outcomes are often poor.
An 18-year-old man deliberately ingested termiticide containing a massive dose of
arsenic trioxide. Arsenic concentration was 6.3 micromol/L in serum on ICU Day 1,
and 253 micromol/L in the first 24-hour urine sample, with a urinary
arsenic/creatinine ratio of 84 200 micromol/mol. He was treated with the
chelating agent meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) (replaced by dimercaprol 
on Days 2-5) and required intensive support for multisystem organ failure, but
recovered slowly. Nine weeks after the ingestion the only ongoing clinical issue 
was persistent but slowly improving peripheral neuropathy.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate antagonism effects of total flavonoids from
Chrysanthemum morifolium. (TFCM) against lead induced oxidative injury.
METHOD: Ninety male mice were randomly divided into 9 groups. Mice except normal 
control group inject lead acetate every other day for 20 days. In the next 10 d, 
drugs were orally administrated to mice once a day. After the last aministration,
mice were sacrificed and immediately subjected to necropsy. The concentration of 
lead, zinc and copper in blood, brain, liver and kidney were determined. The body
weight, relative organ weight, antioxidant enzyme levels (GSH, GSH-Px, SOD and
CAT) and lipid peroxidation products (MDA) were performed.
RESULT: TFCM might antagonize the decrease of body weight and the increase of
organ weight/body weight ratio. The combined treatment with TFCM and DMSA can
significantly lower the lead levels in blood, brain, liver and kidney. In
contrast, lead concentration in mice treated with TFCM alone did not show
significant change in these organs. The other trace elements such as zinc and
copper had no significant decrease after TFCM or DMSA treatment. Middle and
high-dose TFCM was more effective than DMSA in increasing the activity of GSH,
GSH-Px, SOD, CAT and decreasing the concentration of MDA in mice brain. In
addition, high-dose TFCM was more effective than DMSA in increasing the activity 
of GSH-Px, CAT and decreasing the concentration of MDA in mice liver and kidney. 
The combined treatment with TFCM and DMSA also can reverse lipid peroxidation and
increase antioxidant enzyme levels in lead poisoning mice dose-dependently, and
it had more beneficial effects than treatment with DMSA alone.
CONCLUSION: TFCM might improve antioxidant defense system, reverse lipid
peroxidation and protect brain, liver and kidney against lead induced oxidative
damage in mice significantly.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the interobserver reproducibility in reporting on
technetium-99m (99mTc) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan in children.
METHODS: Sixty 99mTc-DMSA scans, issued from three centres, were distributed by
e-mail to nuclear medicine physicians from the five continents interested in
paediatric nuclear medicine. Observers had to choose, for each kidney, among four
answers: normal, abnormal, equivocal or poor quality. An additional question was 
the location of the lesion if any: upper part, mid part, lower part. The
responses had to be returned by e-mail.
RESULTS: Sixty-one observers, with an experience of approximately five or more
99mTc-DMSA/month, contributed to the study. Median agreement was 93%. The
agreement was less than 80% in 29 kidneys (24%) but only in 13% (16 kidneys) was 
there disagreement between normality and abnormality, the remaining cases being
related to 'equivocal' responses. Disagreement was mainly related to the
following patterns: (i) normal variants: pear-shaped kidney, hypoactive poles
contrasting with important parenchymal mass, triangular kidney, unusual shape of 
the columns of Bertin; (ii) congenital abnormalities: hydronephrosis, normal
duplex kidney; (iii) small defects.
CONCLUSION: Interobserver reproducibility can be considered as good among a wide 
number of observers from the five continents. Disagreement among observers could 
be reduced by taking the normal variants into account.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to find out if (90)Y could form a stabile
complex with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and if (90)Y-DMSA may have
potential for tumor therapy in the palliative treatment of bone metastases.
METHODS: The preparing of (90)Y-DMSA was carried out by varying experimental
parameters, such as ligand concentration, pH, time, and temperature of the
reaction, in order to maximize the labeling yield. Analysis of the complexes
enclosed the radiochemical quality control (instant thin-layer chromatography,
paper chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography), determination 
of pharmacokinetical parameters as well as biodistribution study in healthy male 
Wistar rats. In vitro stability of the complexes was tested too.
RESULTS: (90)Y-DMSA could be prepared in high yields (>95%) under optimized
conditions of reaction. Stability studies in saline and human serum in vitro
showed no significant release of activity from the ligand over 24 hours and 10
days, respectively. The preliminary biodistribution results in rat at 2 hours
indicated that (90)Y-DMSA, at both pH levels, was significantly retained into
bone. The uptake in the kidneys was lower for (90)Y-DMSA at pH 8.0 then at pH
3.0. The retention in other organs was negligible.
CONCLUSIONS: (90)Y complexes could be made with ease with DMSA. (90)Y-DMSA was
obtained in good yield and was found to be very stable. A promising
biodistribution result of this complex pointed at potential in the palliative
treatment of bone metastases.

The widespread utilization of prenatal ultrasonography and the detection of
antenatal hydronephrosis (AH) have raised the importance of postnatal follow-up
of these infants. In this study, we aimed to determine the importance of an early
diagnosis for the treatment of urinary tract malformations (UTM) as well as the
postnatal evaluation of growth and nutrition status and the frequency of urinary 
tract infection (UTI) in infants with AH. We evaluated 246 infants (183 boys, 63 
girls) whose routine antenatal scans showed an anterior-posterior pelvic diameter
(APPD) ≥5 mm. Of the 246 patients, 175 (71.1%) were found to be pathological and 
71 were evaluated as normal after the follow-up period. The median follow-up
periods of normal and abnormal cases were 45.7 and 43.4 months, respectively. All
cases with or without UTM were evaluated in terms of UTI, scars on DMSA, growth
[Height Z score (HZ), Weight Z score (WZ)] and nutrition [Weight height index
(WHI)] status. The annual UTI frequency was higher in cases with UTM (1.32 ± 1.66
episode/year) than in cases without abnormality (0.27 ± 0.67 episode/year) (P <
0.001). The postnatal evaluation of growth and nutritional status in children
with UTM (mean WHI, HZ, and WZ scores: 96.82 ± 10.21, 0.03 ± 0.54 and 0.04 ±
0.61, respectively) was found to be significantly worse than in cases without
abnormality (102.25 ± 9.84, 0.14 ± 0.64 and 0.24 ± 0.76, respectively), (P <
0.05). In abnormal patients, the mean WHI, HZ, and WZ were significantly improved
to 101.63 ± 9.75, 0.26 ± 1.07, and 0.28 ± 0.98, respectively, and HZ or WZ scores
were found to be similar when compared to normals. In conclusion, postnatal early
management of infants with AH seems to prevent frequent UTIs and nutritional
disturbances enabling normal growth.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive value of renal ultrasound scanning and
99m-Technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy for high-grade
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in young children with a first urinary tract
infection (UTI).
STUDY DESIGN: The medical records of children who had been examined with renal
ultrasound scanning, DMSA scanning, and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) were
reviewed. The findings of renal ultrasound scanning, DMSA scanning, and their
predictive values were evaluated.
RESULTS: Of 699 children, high-grade VUR (grades III-V) was diagnosed in 119
(17.0%). Signs of renal hypodysplasia (OR, 16.15), cyclic dilatation of
pelvicaliceal system (OR, 11.73), hydroureter (OR, 4.00) with renal ultrasound
scanning, and renal hypodysplasia (OR, 8.78), acute pyelonephritis (OR, 2.76)
with DMSA scanning were associated with high-grade VUR. The sensitivities for
high-grade VUR of ultrasound scanning alone (67.2%) or DMSA scanning alone
(65.5%) were not as good as that of a both-test strategy, which had a sensitivity
rate of 83.2%. The negative predictive value of the both-test strategy was 91.5%.
CONCLUSION: Renal ultrasound scanning and DMSA scanning both should be routinely 
performed in children with a first febrile UTI. VCUG is only indicated when
abnormalities are apparent on either ultrasound scanning or DMSA scanning or
both.

BACKGROUND: Nonoperative treatment of blunt renal trauma in children is
progressively gaining acceptance; grade 5 renal trauma is associated with a
significant rate of complications.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and outcome of initial nonoperative
management of grade 5 blunt renal trauma in children.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective study included 18 children 
(12 boys and 6 girls; mean age: 8.4+/-3.4 yr) who presented to the authors'
institutes with grade 5 blunt renal trauma between 1990 and 2007.
MEASUREMENTS: An intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan
demonstrated grade 5 renal trauma in all patients. Associated major vascular
injuries were suspected in four patients. All were initially managed
conservatively. Indications for intervention included hemodynamic instability,
progressive urinoma, or persistent bleeding. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans
were performed at a mean time of 3.1 yr (range: 1-17) following the injury in
nine patients.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Four patients (22%) with suspected major vascular
injuries required nephrectomy 1-21 d following the trauma. Two patients with
continuing hemorrhage required selective lower-pole arterial embolization (11%). 
Three patients (17%) had their progressive urinoma drained percutaneously, and
two of them required delayed reparative surgery for ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) 
avulsion. Nine patients (50%) were successfully managed nonoperatively. Kidneys
were salvaged in 78% of patients. DMSA scanning showed a split function >40% in
44% of evaluated kidneys. Two patients (22%) had split function <30%. At last
follow-up, none of the children were hypertensive or had any abnormality on urine
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Nonoperative management of grade 5 renal trauma is feasible. Prompt 
surgical intervention is required for those with major vascular injuries.
Superselective arterial embolization can be an excellent option in patients with 
continuing hemorrhage and who have pseudoaneurysms. Patients with UPJ disruption 
can be salvaged by initial drainage of the urinoma followed by deferred
correction.

The study of the changes in the biochemical and mineral contents of bones of
Catla catla due to lead intoxication.

In the present study, an attempt has been made to analyze the changes in the
biochemical and mineral contents of lead-intoxicated bones of Catla catla at
subchronic (15.5 ppm) exposure, and also to determine whether the effects of Pb
intoxication can be reversed with the chelating agent meso 2,
3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on the bones of freshwater fingerlings Catla
catla by using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction
(XRD), and atomic absorption spectrophotometer techniques. The FT-IR spectra of
the lead-exposed bones show significant alteration in the biochemical
constituents. The XRD analysis showed a decrease in crystallinity due to lead
exposure. Further, the Ca, Mg, and P contents of the lead-exposed bones were less
than those of the control group, and there was an increase in the mineral
contents of the bones after DMSA treatment. In conclusion, the present study
suggests that the subchronic lead exposure results in severe loss of bone
minerals. The overall decrease in the FT-IR band intensity of Pb-exposed bones
relative to the control indicates a decrease in the biochemical constituents like
proteins and lipids. The increase in the band intensity after treatment with
chelating agent DMSA indicates increased biochemical constituents, showing that
the subchronic effects of lead can be reversed by DMSA. The amide I bands
observed at 1654 cm(-1) in the present study suggest that the protein is
dominated by alpha-helical structure.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of procalcitonin (PCT) as a 
marker of renal scars in infants and young children with a first episode of acute
pyelonephritis. Children aged 7 days to 36 months admitted for first febrile
urinary tract infection (UTI) to a pediatric emergency department were
prospectively enrolled. The PCT concentration was determined at admission. Acute 
(99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy was performed within 7 days
of admission and repeated 12 months later when abnormal findings were obtained on
the first scan. Of the 72 children enrolled in the study, 52 showed signs of
acute pyelonephritis (APN) on the first DMSA scan. A follow-up scintigraphy at
the 12-month follow-up performed on 41 patients revealed that 14 (34%) patients
had developed renal scars; these patients also presented significantly higher PCT
values than those without permanent renal lesions [2.3 (interquartile range
1-11.6) vs. 0.5 (0.2-1.4) ng/mL; p = 0.007]. A comparison of the PCT
concentration in patients with febrile UTI without renal involvement, with APN
without scar development and with APN with subsequent renal scarring revealed a
significant increasing trend (p = 0.006, Kruskal-Wallis test). The area under the
ROC curve for scar prediction was 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.61-0.85), with 
an optimum statistical cut-off value of 1 ng/mL (sensitivity 78.6%; specificity
63.8%). Based on these results, we suggest that serum PCT concentration at
admission is a useful predictive tool of renal scarring in infants and young
children with acute pyelonephritis.

Hydrophilic 2,3-dimercaptosuccinnic acid (HOOC-CH(SH)-CH(SH)-COOH, DMSA) coated
monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) were dispersed in water, RPMI-1640
with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, RPMI-1640, PBS and MES, respectively, to
investigate their stability under biologically relevant conditions. The Photon
Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) results showed that DMSA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles
existed as aggregate under biological conditions. UV-vis, MRI and AFM results
indicated that DMSA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles dispersed in RPMI-1640, PBS and MES
presented poor stability, whereas those dispersed in RPMI-1640 with fetal calf
serum exhibited excellent stability, which was due to their adsorption from fetal
calf serum, as confirmed by zeta potential and IR results. Additionally, in vitro
cell experiments showed that DMSA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles with adsorption from fetal 
calf serum had higher intracellular uptake than those without adsorption from
serum, indicating that fetal calf serum could play a great role in intracellular 
uptake of nanoparticles.

Evaluation of the binding properties of maghemite nanoparticle surface-coated
with meso-2-3-dimercaptosuccinic acid to serum albumin.

In this study the interaction between magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)
surface-coated with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) with both bovine
serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) was investigated. The binding
of the MNP-DMSA was probed by the fluorescence quenching of the BSA and HSA
tryptophan residue. Magnetic resonance and light microscopy analyses were carried
out in in vivo tests using female Swiss mice. The binding constants (Kb) and the 
complex stoichiometries (n) indicate that MNP-DMSA/BSA and MNP-DMSA/HSA complexes
have low association profiles. After five minutes following intravenous injection
of MNP-DMSA into mice's blood stream we found the lung firstly target by the
MNP-DMSA, followed by the liver in a latter stage. This finding suggests that the
nanoparticle's DMSA-coating process probably hides the thiol group, through which
albumin usually binds. This indicates that biocompatible MNP-DMSA is a very

While (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning is still considered the
most accurate method for the assessment of renal parenchymal defects (RPDs), our 
study 6 years previously suggested that ultrasonography (US) could be a safe and 
efficient substitute for this purpose, provided that it is reliably performed and
that renal function parameters are followed. By comparison of the original and
follow-up study data from 67 children, the accuracy of our recommendations was
re-evaluated. US was performed and renal function parameters investigated and
correlated to the DMSA scans from the original study. US identified all six
patients with clinically significant RPD and 52/61 with clinically insignificant 
RPDs, seen on the DMSA scans. Twenty two out of 22 severe RPDs, 21/23 moderate
RPDs and 20/40 mild RPDs seen on the DMSA scans were detected by US. In ten cases
normal US findings from the original study were rendered abnormal, correlating
well with the DMSA scans with respect to RPD localization and kidney size. These 
results further support our previous suggestion that US is a safe and harmless
alternative to DMSA scanning in the detection and follow-up of RPDs. While it
cannot be excluded that small RPDs missed on the initial US might 'develop'
clinical significance in later life, children with normal findings on initial US 
should have another sonogram done, at the shortest a year later, together with an
investigation of renal function parameters.

Scintigraphic imaging in renal infections.

Rossleigh MA(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Prince of Wales and Sydney Children's
Hospitals, Sydney, Australia.

The scintigraphic imaging modality of choice in the evaluation of renal
infections is renal cortical scintigraphy utilizing [(99m)Tc]dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA). This technique is able to demonstrate upper tract involvement with
infection and to assess for the presence of renal cortical scarring following a
urinary tract infection (UTI). There are recent publications advocating its use
to determine which patients need to proceed to further investigation with
cystography. It is also being utilized in the evaluation of different treatment
regimes used in patients with UTI. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and leukocyte
scanning have only a minor role in the diagnosis of renal infection. Their main
application is in the diagnosis of renal cyst infections in patients with
polycystic renal disease.

BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to determine the incidence of urinary tract
infection (UTI) and the frequency of anatomical abnormalities in newborns with
unexplained jaundice and to find out if there is any correlation between
bilirubin level and renal damage.
METHODS: We studied 462 full-term neonates for UTI. They were aged 3-25 days,
with either high (>10 mg/dL) or prolonged (>10 days) hyperbilirubinemia, with or 
without manifestations such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, poor feeding, lethargy,
and irritability. Neonates positive for UTI were further investigated with
ultrasound, cystourethrography, and acute phase renal scintigraphy with
technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinate acid (DMSA).
RESULTS: Thirty neonates (6.5%) were found to have UTI. Twenty-eight of them had 
indirect hyperbilirubinemia and two had direct hyperbilirubinemia, with total
bilirubin levels of 11.8-20.1 mg/dL. None of the neonates was found to have
jaundice because of other reasons such as infection. Vesicoureteral reflux was
found in 5 neonates and one of them was combined with hydronephrosis. Renal
scintigraphy with technetium-99m DMSA showed renal cortex changes in 14 (46.7%)
of the 30 neonates with UTI. These 14 neonates also had increased levels of
bilirubin in comparison to those with normal findings of DMSA.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of UTI in uncomplicated neonatal jaundice is
relatively high. Anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract are not rare in
infected children. Increased bilirubin levels are related to pathological
findings in renal scintigraphy.

AIMS: To evaluate whether transient renal artery clamping and external renal
hypothermia cause any detrimental effect on the remaining renal parenchyma after 
nephron-sparing surgery with the use of (99m)Tc-DMSA-SPECT.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with a unilateral renal mass but a normal
contralateral kidney underwent nephron-sparing surgery. Serum biochemistry,
24-hour urinary creatinine clearance and absolute uptakes of the injected dose
(%ID) of both kidneys as measured by renal (99m)Tc-DMSA-SPECT were compared
preoperatively and in the 3rd postoperative month. (99m)Tc-DMSA uptakes in the
contralateral kidney were used as controls.
RESULTS: The average tumor size and mean renal artery clamping time were 37.4 +/-
11.3 (range 25-68) mm and 53.7 +/- 13 (range 38-90) min, respectively. Pre- and
postoperative mean absolute uptakes of %ID in the remaining parenchyma of the
operated kidneys were 15.13 +/- 3.30 and 14.74 +/- 3.38%, respectively (p =
0.052). In the contralateral kidneys, there was also no significant difference
between the two studies (18.82 +/- 6.26 vs. 19.14 +/- 7.19%, respectively; p =
0.546). Likewise, there was no statistically significant difference between pre- 
and postoperative serum creatinine (p = 0.179) and creatinine clearance values (p
= 0.108).
CONCLUSION: Renal artery clamping and external cooling during nephron-sparing
surgery have no demonstrable harmful effects on the renal parenchyma as measured 
by (99m)Tc-DMSA-SPECT analysis.

Comment in
    J Urol. 2010 Nov;184(5):2134-5.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the reliability of procalcitonin (PCT) with conventional
laboratory parameters in predicting for renal parenchymal inflammation (RPI).
METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 57 children who were admitted for a
first-episode urinary tract infection. All patients underwent measurement of the 
leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), 
and serum PCT. RPI was evaluated by technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy within 7 days of admission. If the first DMSA findings were
abnormal, another analysis was performed 6 months later. The cutoff points for
ESR, CRP, and PCT were established by comparing the areas under their receiver
operating characteristic curves. Statistical analysis was performed using 1-way
analysis of variance.
RESULTS: Of the 57 children, 27 were diagnosed with RPI on the basis of positive 
DMSA results. The ESR, CRP, and PCT levels were significantly greater (P < .001) 
in the patients with RPI than in those without RPI. In contrast, the leukocyte
count was the same in both groups (P > .05). PCT was a more sensitive and
specific marker for differentiating upper and lower urinary tract infection than 
ESR and CRP. Persistent lesions at the site of previous RPI were found in 12
patients in the follow-up DMSA analysis, with total regression evident in the
remaining 15. The PCT levels were significantly greater in those with persistent 
renal lesions than in those with total regression (P = .005).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum PCT is a more reliable biologic marker than the ESR, CRP, or
leukocyte count for the early prediction of RPI in children with a first episode 
of urinary tract infection. In addition, the greater the elevation of PCT at
admission, the more positive the correlation for subsequent permanent renal
damage.

OBJECTIVES: The present study reports on the preparation and testing of a
desoxycholate amphotericin B (D-AMB) sustained delivery system based on
poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) polymeric
blends (Nano-D-AMB) aimed at reducing the number of AMB administrations required 
to treat mycosis.
METHODS: BALB/c mice were infected with the yeast Paracoccidioides brasiliensis
intravenously to mimic the chronic form of paracoccidioidomycosis. At 30 days
post-infection, the animals were treated with Nano-D-AMB [6 mg/kg of encapsulated
D-AMB, intraperitoneally (ip), interval of 72 h] or D-AMB (2 mg/kg, ip, interval 
of 24 h). Drug efficacy was investigated by the fungal burden recovery from
tissues. Toxicity was assessed by renal and hepatic biochemical parameters,
physical appearance of the animals and haematological investigation. The control 
groups used were non-infected and the infected mice mock treated with PBS.
RESULTS: Nano-D-AMB presented results comparable to free D-AMB, with a marked
antifungal efficacy. The Nano-D-AMB-treated group presented lower loss of body
weight and absence of stress sign (piloerection and hypotrichosis) observed after
D-AMB treatment. No renal [blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine] or hepatic
(pyruvic and oxalacetic glutamic transaminases) biochemical abnormalities were
found. The micronucleus assay showed no significant differences in both the
micronucleus frequency and percentage of polychromatic erythrocytes for
Nano-D-AMB, indicating the absence of genotoxicity and cytotoxic effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The D-AMB-coated PLGA-DMSA nanoparticle showed antifungal efficacy, 
fewer undesirable effects and a favourable extended dosing interval. Nano-D-AMB
comprises an AMB formulation able to lessen the number of drug administrations.
Further studies would elucidate whether Nano-D-AMB would be useful to treat
systemic fungal infections such as paracoccidioidomycosis, candidiasis,
aspergillosis and cryptococcosis.

Renal cortical involvement in children with first UTI: does it differ in the
presence of primary VUR?

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphic
patterns in children with first symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: A total of 45 children with the diagnosis of first symptomatic UTI (28
girls, 17 boys, mean age 18 months, range 1 month-11 years) were reviewed. All
DMSA scans were obtained within 2 months of bacteriologically proven UTI (median 
21 days, mean 26 +/- 21, 14). After the exclusion of the patients with bilateral 
cortical lesions, 82 renal units were analyzed. The scintigraphic patterns
included regional and global description of renal cortical abnormality (normal or
decreased differential renal function, regional renal function (RRF), and the
number and severity of cortical lesions).
RESULTS: Vesicoureteral reflux was detected in 26 (32%) renal units (15 with
grade 1-2, 11 with grade 3-4). Renal cortical abnormality was observed in 10
renal units without VUR (10/56, 17%) and 13 renal units with VUR (13/26: 50%). Of
the 15 renal units, 5 with grade 1-2 VUR (5/15) and 8 of the 11 renal units with 
grade 3-4 VUR (8/11) had renal cortical involvement. The most common
scintigraphic pattern in the patients without VUR was the preserved RRF (>or=45%)
and two or fewer photon-deficient areas. On the other hand, a decreased RRF (<45)
associated with cortical lesions was the most frequent finding in patients with
refluxing kidneys (8/26, 30%), especially in those with grade 3-4 disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This investigation showed that the presence of VUR affects DMSA
patterns in children with first symptomatic UTI.

INTRODUCTION: The presence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in an infant with
urinary tract infection (UTI), does not necessarily lead to an acquired renal
injury. Only serious reflux can be a factor in fostering its appearance.
OBJECTIVES: To assess whether in infants diagnosed for the first time with a UTI 
with a fever, a routine initial DMSA can be used as a screening method for
detecting severe reflux and replace voiding cystourethrography (VCUG).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 162 infants under 2 years old
admitted to our hospital due to having a ITU with fever for the first time (92
males and 70 females). In all cases, a renal ultrasound, DMSA and VCUG had been
performed a few days after the diagnosis.
RESULTS: Of the 162 patients, 62 (38 %) had VUR, of which 56 (90 %) were mild and
6 (10 %) were severe. The DMSA was abnormal in 26/100 patients without VUR (26
%), 12/56 with mild VUR (21 %) and 6/6 of those with severe VUR (100 %). DMSA
sensitivity for detecting severe reflux was 100 % and specificity was 76 %. The
positive predictive value and negative predictive value was 14 % and 100 %
respectively. The positive likelihood ratio was 4.17 and the negative likelihood 
ratio was 0.
CONCLUSIONS: It is unnecessary to carry out VCUG in an infant with an initial
UTI, and a negative DMSA.

Urine mercury excretion following meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid challenge in fish 
eaters.

CONTEXT: Public awareness of methylmercury in fish has caused patients to seek
testing for mercury poisoning. In some patients, the diagnosis of mercury
poisoning has been made based on urine mercury excretions following oral dosing
of meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), a metal chelator. However, studies
comparing urine mercury excretion following DMSA in healthy non-fish eaters with 
healthy fish eaters could not be located.
OBJECTIVES: To describe urinary mercury excretion before and after DMSA in
healthy fish eaters and non-fish eaters, and to determine whether urine mercury
excretion after DMSA would rise above baseline levels to a greater extent in fish
eaters.
DESIGN: A total of 24 healthy physicians were assigned to 1 of 3 groups based on 
fish consumption: non-fish eaters; 1 to 2 fish servings per week; and 3 or more
servings per week. Blood mercury concentrations and 12-hour urine mercury and
creatinine excretions were measured before and after oral ingestion of 30 mg of
DMSA per kilogram of body weight.
RESULTS: A total of 24 subjects completed the study, and 2 subsequently were
excluded. No difference in baseline urinary mercury excretion was detected
between groups. All groups demonstrated an increase in urinary mercury excretion 
following DMSA, which was higher in fish eaters (P = .04). Multiple linear
regression found that the best predictor of a rise in urine mercury excretion
following DMSA challenge was the prechelation blood mercury concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study of healthy physicians, oral DMSA produced a rise in
urine mercury excretion both in non-fish eaters and fish eaters. The increase in 
chelated mercury excretion was higher in fish eaters. A simple rise in chelated
mercury excretion over baseline excretion is not a reliable diagnostic indicator 
of mercury poisoning.

marco.zaffanello@univr.it

To review the most relevant clinical studies that evaluate kidney damage in
children with primary vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR), we reviewed and compared
randomized controlled trials and clinical trials from scientific literature. In
these studies, vesico-ureteral reflux was diagnosed by voiding cystourethrogram
and kidney damage was assessed by either DMSA scan or urography. Relative risk
with 95% confidence intervals was calculated using Review Manager Software (The
Cochrane Collaboration, 2000). The overall relative risk of kidney damage shown
by DMSA scan and urography was statistically higher in children with
vesico-ureteral reflux of various degrees than in controls (3.7 times and 2.8
times, respectively). However, in high-grade VUR, the relative risk of congenital
kidney damage was 5.6 times that of controls. We conclude that severe VUR is
frequently associated with early kidney damage, perhaps with prenatal onset.
Progression of kidney damage may depend on the severity of VUR and untreated
urinary tract infections. Prevention of congenital kidney damage from severe VUR 
is possible when there is early intervention, even during fetal growth.

Heavy metal induced oxidative stress & its possible reversal by chelation
therapy.

Flora SJ(1), Mittal M, Mehta A.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Defence Research & Development
Establishment, Gwalior, India. sjsflora@hotmail.com

Exposure to heavy metals is a common phenomenon due to their environmental
pervasiveness. Metal intoxication particularly neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, or
carcinogenicity is widely known. This review summarizes our current understanding
about the mechanism by which metalloids or heavy metals (particularly arsenic,
lead, cadmium and mercury) induce their toxic effects. The unifying factor in
determining toxicity and carcinogenicity for all these metals is the generation
of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The toxic manifestations of these metals
are caused primarily due to imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant
homeostasis which is termed as oxidative stress. Besides these metals have high
affinity for thiol groups containing enzymes and proteins, which are responsible 
for normal cellular defense mechanism. Long term exposure to these metals could
lead to apoptosis. Signaling components affected by metals include growth factor 
receptors, G-proteins, MAP kinases and transcription factors. Chelation therapy
with chelating agents like calcium disodium ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid
(CaNa(2)EDTA), British Anti Lewisite (BAL), sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropane
1-sulfonate (DMPS), meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) etc., is considered
to be the best known treatment against metal poisoning. Despite many years of
research we are still far away from effective treatment against toxicity caused
due to exposure to heavy metals/metalloids. The treatment with these chelating
agents is compromised with number of serious side-effects. Studies show that
supplementation of antioxidants along-with a chelating agent prove to be a better
treatment regimen than monotherapy with chelating agents. This review attempts a 
comprehensive account of recent developments in the research on heavy metal
poisoning particularly the role of oxidative stress/free radicals in the toxic
manifestation, an update about the recent strategies for the treatment with
chelating agents and a possible beneficial role of antioxidants supplementation
to achieve the optimum effects. We have selected only arsenic, lead, mercury and 
cadmium for this article keeping in view current concerns and literature
available.

(1)Department of Kidney and Rheumatism, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, 
Shanghai 200032, China.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical features, renal damage and prognosis of
primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in children, hoping to give more attention to
early recognition and treatment of the disease.
METHODS: Between June 1995 and December 2006, 974 patient were admitted in our
hospital because of urinary tract infection (UTI), 139 primary VUR children were 
enrolled in the retrospective study. VUR grades, renal scar development, renal
ultrasound and urinalysis were evaluated.
RESULTS: The incidence of VUR in UTI children was 14.3% (139/974), however, the
incidence in infants and toddlers (younger than two years of age) was 17.2%
(79/458), which was greatly higher than that in school children. Of the 139
children, 79(56.8%) were younger than two years and the number of boys was much
larger than that of girls (P = 0.001). Bilateral reflux was found in 69 cases,
unilateral in 70 cases; the percentages of mild reflux (grade I-II) was 19.7%
(41/208), moderate reflux (grade III) was 35.6% (74/208), severe reflux (grade
IV-V) was 44.7% (93/208). Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning was performed
for 135 patients, and renal scar was found in 37% (50/135), and the rate of scar 
in infants was the highest (42.4%), and 30 (60%) patients with renal scar were
younger than two years of age. Among them five patients were found to have renal 
scar during the follow up period, four of them were younger than two years. The
rate of renal scar in moderate and severe reflux was much higher than that in
mild reflux cases, the risk of occurring renal scar would increase with its
severity of reflux (P < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of renal
ultrasound in suggesting VUR were 24.8% and 94.3%, respectively. The positive
outcome of urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase was a bit high, but there were
no associations between renal scar and urinary microprotein (P > 0.05).
Thirty-one cases were followed up for long time (> 1 year); and 90% of urinary
infection was controlled and in 44.4% of patients VUR disappeared with medical
treatment. No child had decreasing renal function in follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: Children with primary VUR need early diagnosis and treatment.
Insisting on normal therapy and long-term follow-up will protect renal function
effectively.

MRP2 involvement in renal proximal tubular elimination of methylmercury mediated 
by DMPS or DMSA.

Zalups RK(1), Bridges CC.

2, 3-Dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS) and meso-2, 3-Dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) are dithiols used to treat humans exposed to methylmercury
(CH(3)Hg(+)). After treatment, significant amounts of mercury are eliminated
rapidly from the kidneys and are excreted in urine. In the present study, we
extended our previous studies by testing the hypothesis that MRP2 mediates the
secretion of DMPS or DMSA S-conjugates of CH(3)Hg(+). To test this hypothesis,
the disposition of mercury was assessed in control and Mrp2-deficient (TR(-))
rats exposed intravenously to a 5.0-mg/kg dose of CH(3)HgCl. Twenty-four and 28 h
after exposure, groups of four control and four TR(-) rats were injected with
saline, DMPS, or DMSA. Tissues were harvested 48 h later. Renal and hepatic
contents of mercury were greater in saline-injected TR(-) rats than in controls. 
In contrast, the amounts of mercury excreted in urine and feces by TR(-) rats
were less than those by controls. DMPS and DMSA significantly reduced the renal
and hepatic content of mercury in both groups of rats, with the greatest
reduction in controls. A significant increase in urinary and fecal excretion of
mercury (which was greater in the controls) was also observed. Our findings in
inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from hMRP2-transfected Sf9 cells show that 
uptake of DMPS and DMSA S-conjugates of CH(3)Hg(+) was greater in the vesicles
containing hMRP2 than in control vesicles. Overall, these dispositional findings 
indicate that MRP2 does play a role in DMPS- and DMSA-mediated elimination of
mercury from the kidney.

OBJECTIVE: Young children may develop renal scarring following a urinary tract
infection (UTI) especially after pyelonephritis which is difficult to diagnose.
Permanent renal scars are diagnosed by dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scan
several months later. To decrease unnecessary exposure to radiation, we
investigate the role of renal power Doppler (RPD) in predicting those who may not
require a late DMSA scan.
METHODS: Children under four years of age with a first UTI underwent an RPD study
soon after diagnosis, and a DMSA scintigraphy six months later. The predictive
values of the early RPD to detect DMSA renal scarring were calculated.
RESULTS: Twenty three children (median age 30 months) were enrolled: 13 had a
febrile presentation, two with bacteraemia. Permanent scarring occurred in three 
children (13%). In the 46 kidney units studied, initial RPD was abnormal in two
and late DMSA abnormal in three units. Overall concordance between RPD and DMSA
was 93.5%. The sensitivity of RPD for renal scar as per DMSA was 33.3%,
specificity 97.7%; positive predictive value 50% and a negative predictive value 
of 95.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: RPD offered no advantage over ultrasound to predict renal scarring
and cannot be recommended to predict renal scarring following UTI.

The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) systems from Bacillus subtilis display a
conserved mode of complex organization and similar substrate recognition
requirements.

The twin arginine translocation (Tat) system transports folded proteins across
the bacterial plasma membrane. In Gram-negative bacteria, membrane-bound TatABC
subunits are all essential for activity, whereas Gram-positive bacteria usually
contain only TatAC subunits. In Bacillus subtilis, two TatAC-type systems,
TatAdCd and TatAyCy, operate in parallel with different substrate specificities. 
Here, we show that they recognize similar signal peptide determinants. Both
systems translocate green fluorescent protein fused to three distinct Escherichia
coli Tat signal peptides, namely DmsA, AmiA and MdoD, and mutagenesis of the DmsA
signal peptide confirmed that both Tat pathways recognize similar targeting
determinants within Tat signals. Although another E. coli Tat substrate,
trimethylamine N-oxide reductase, was translocated by TatAdCd but not by TatAyCy,
we conclude that these systems are not predisposed to recognize only specific Tat
signal peptides, as suggested by their narrow substrate specificities in B.
subtilis. We also analysed complexes involved in the second Tat pathway in B.
subtilis, TatAyCy. This revealed a discrete TatAyCy complex together with a
separate, homogeneous, approximately 200 kDa TatAy complex. The latter complex
differs significantly from the corresponding E. coli TatA complexes, pointing to 
major structural differences between Tat complexes from Gram-negative and
Gram-positive organisms. Like TatAd, TatAy is also detectable in the form of
massive cytosolic complexes.

Effects of chelators on mercury, iron, and lead neurotoxicity in cortical
culture.

Chelation therapy for the treatment of acute, high dose exposure to heavy metals 
is accepted medical practice. However, a much wider use of metal chelators is by 
alternative health practitioners for so called "chelation therapy". Given this
widespread and largely unregulated use of metal chelators it is important to
understand the actions of these compounds. We tested the effects of four commonly
used metal chelators, calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (CaNa2EDTA),
D-penicillamine (DPA), 2,3 dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS), and
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) for their effects on heavy metal neurotoxicity in 
primary cortical cultures. We studied the toxicity of three forms of mercury,
inorganic mercury (HgCl2), methyl mercury (MeHg), and ethyl mercury (thimerosal),
as well as lead (PbCl2) and iron (Fe-citrate). DPA had the worst profile of
effects, providing no protection while potentiating HgCl2, thimerosal, and
Fe-citrate toxicity. DMPS and DMSA both attenuated HgCl2 toxicity and potentiated
thimerosal and Fe toxicity, while DMPS also potentiated PbCl2 toxicity. CaNa2EDTA
attenuated HgCl2 toxicity, but caused a severe potentiation of Fe-citrate
toxicity. The ability of these chelators to attenuate the toxicity of various
metals is quite restricted, and potentiation of toxicity is a serious concern.
Specifically, protection is provided only against inorganic mercury, while it is 
lacking against the common form of mercury found in food, MeHg, and the form
found in vaccines, thimerosal. The potentiation of Fe-citrate toxicity is of
concern because of iron's role in oxidative stress in the body. Potentiation of
iron toxicity could have serious health consequences when using chelation
therapy.

Surfactant-laden soft contact lenses for extended delivery of ophthalmic drugs.

Eye drops are inefficient means of delivering ophthalmic drugs because of limited
bioavailability and these can cause significant side effects due to systemic
uptake of the drug. The bioavailability for ophthalmic drugs can be increased
significantly by using contact lenses. This study focuses on the development of
surfactant-laden poly-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate (p-HEMA) contact lenses that can
release Cyclosporine A (CyA) at a controlled rate for extended periods of time.
We focus on various Brij surfactants to investigate the effects of chain length
and the presence of an unsaturated group on the drug release dynamics and
partitioning inside the surfactant domains inside the gel. The gels were imaged
by cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) to obtain direct evidence of
the presence of surfactant aggregates in the gel, and to investigate the detailed
microstructure for different surfactants. The images show a distribution of nano 
pores inside the surfactant-laden hydrogels which we speculate are regions of
surfactant aggregates, possibly vesicles that have a high affinity for the
hydrophobic drug molecule. The gels are further characterized by studying their
mechanical and physical properties such as transparency, surface contact angle
and equilibrium water content to determine their suitability as extended wear
contact lenses. Results show that Brij surfactant-laden p-HEMA gels provide
extended release of CyA, and possess suitable mechanical and optical properties
for contact lens applications. The gels are not as effective for extended release
of two other hydrophobic ophthalmic drugs, dexamethasone (DMS) and dexamethasone 
21 acetate (DMSA) because of insufficient partitioning inside the surfactant
aggregates.

The aim of this study was to determine whether a postnatal ultrasound (US) can
detect infants with antenatal renal pelvis dilatation (ARPD) who run a minimal
risk of renal damage 2 years after birth. The study cohort consisted of 14,000
pregnant women who consecutively underwent routine US examinations during the
second trimester. Subsequent examinations were performed on the basis of
obstetrical indications. In total, 106 foetuses were diagnosed with ARPD > or =5 
mm. Two postnatal US were performed on the newborns: on postpartum days 5-7 and
during the third week of life. The findings were considered to be normal when the
renal pelvis diameter (RPD) was < or = 7 mm and when there was no calyceal or
ureteric dilatation or signs of renal dysplasia or other anomalies. Voiding
cystourethrography (VCUG) was done at 6-8 weeks after birth. When the children
reached 2 years of age, renal status was evaluated with DMSA scintigraphy or, if 
not possible, US. In 53 of the 103 children available for evaluation, the
postnatal US findings were normal; 49 of the 53 children were also given a DMSA, 
and the results were normal in all cases. An US scan (all normal) only was
performed in three children because the families refused a DMSA. One family
refused any form of examination at the 2-year follow-up. Based on our results, we
conclude that postnatal US can detect infants who do not require follow-up
assessments of renal development.

OBJECTIVE: The relationships among urinary tract infection (UTI), vesicoureteral 
reflux (VUR), and permanent renal damage in children are not fully understood.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of renal scarring in children
with a history of UTI and to determine the change in the probability of permanent
renal damage owing to the presence of VUR documented on micturating
cystourethrography (MCU).
METHODS: We analyzed 201 children (400 renal units, two children with solitary
kidney). Seventy-four boys and 127 girls (aged 7 months to 7 years, median 2.5
years) with culture verified UTI were referred for technetium-labeled
dimercaptosuccinic (DMSA) renal scintigraphy 4-6 months after acute UTI. MCU was 
also performed mostly 1 month prior to DMSA. Statistical analysis was performed
using chi2 test or Fisher's exact test. Likelihood ratio (LR) positive and
negative, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and post-test probability of (no) disease 
were calculated for VUR on MCU versus scarring on DMSA.
RESULTS: Vesicoureteral reflux was found in 158 (39.5%) kidneys, and evaluated as
grades I, II, III, IV, and V in 3, 70, 43, 25, and 17 refluxing renal units
(RRU), respectively. Permanent renal damage according to DMSA was seen in 15.2%
(61/400) kidneys. Scarring was shown in 29.7% (47/158) of kidneys with VUR and in
5.8% (14/242) kidneys without VUR (P<0.0001). LR positive was 2.353 (95% CI
1.889, 2.865), LR negative 0.341 (95% CI 0.209, 0.523), and DOR 6.895 (95% CI
3.533, 14.093). Rate of scarring significantly increased with VUR of grades III, 
IV, and V. There was no significant difference in the incidence of scarring in
kidneys without VUR and RRU with low-grade (I and II) VUR (P=0.306). The presence
of VUR on MCU increased the chance of renal damage on DMSA by about 15%, whereas 
negative MCU increased the chance of no-renal involvement by 9%.
CONCLUSIONS: Micturating cystourethrography should not be used as a first-line
test to rule out the permanent renal damage owing to UTI. The priority of imaging
strategy should be focused on early identification of renal lesions to prevent
further deterioration.

OBJECTIVE: Acute pyelonephritis is a common infectious disease in children and
can result in permanent renal damage. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important
mediator of inflammation in response to bacterial infection. This study
investigated the potential relationship between acute-phase IL-6 and subsequent
renal scarring in children with a first time febrile acute pyelonephritis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 79 children (age range 1-120 months) with a first
time febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) were included. The diagnosis of acute 
pyelonephritis was confirmed by (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal
scan. Serum and urine samples were collected for IL-6 measurement by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before antibiotic treatment for the infection.
RESULTS: The 79 children were divided into acute pyelonephritis (n=45) and lower 
UTI (n=34) groups according to the findings of DMSA scans. The initial serum and 
urine IL-6 levels of children with acute pyelonephritis were significantly higher
compared with lower UTI (p < 0.001). Renal scarring was detected at the follow-up
DMSA scans in 15 (34.1%) of the 44 children with acute pyelonephritis. Both serum
and urine IL-6 levels during the acute phase of pyelonephritis were significantly
higher in children with renal scarring than in those without (p=0.005 and p =
0.002). The median age of children with renal scarring was significantly lower
than those without (p=0.034). Multiple regression analysis showed that higher
initial serum and urine IL-6 levels and a younger age were associated with renal 
scarring.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that in younger children with a first time 
febrile acute pyelonephritis, elevations of the acute-phase serum and urine IL-6 
levels were correlated with an increased risk of subsequent renal scarring.

A flow-injection procedure for spectrophotometric determination of sulphate in
soil solutions is proposed. Samples are directly soaked from the soils under
field conditions, in-line filtered through ceramic plates, and preserved with
thymol. The method involves reaction with barium dimethylsulphonazo(III) (DMSA)
in the presence of dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) with further measuring the decrease 
in absorbance at 668nm. A linear response is observed up to about 5mgl(-1) SO(4),
and detection limit (3sigma criterion) is 0.1mgl(-1) SO(4). Only 4.5mug DMSA is
consumed per determination. The system is rugged and baseline drift is not
observed during extended operation periods. About 60 samples are injected per
hour, and the results are precise (r.s.d. <2%) and in agreement with ion
chromatography.

(1)Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki University, Stenbäckinkatu 11,
00290 Helsinki, Finland.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether renal scars and
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) are associated with bladder dysfunction in children
after first clinical pyelonephritis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four children were evaluated with urodynamics and
voiding cystourethrography at a median of 8 weeks after their first episode of
clinical pyelonephritis. All patients had ultrasonography and dimercaptosuccinic 
acid (DMSA) scintigraphy during the infection. After 2 years, DMSA scintigraphy
was repeated in 58 patients. Re-infections were recorded.
RESULTS: Overactive detrusor was found in 27 (42%) patients. There was no
significant difference in the incidence of overactive detrusor between boys and
girls. The maximal voiding pressure was higher in boys (median 92.5, range 48-191
cmH(2)O) than in girls (median 82, range 37-150 cmH(2)O) (P=0.0117). Thirty-one
(48%) patients had renal defects in scintigraphy during the infection.
Ultimately, 12 patients (21%) developed renal scars; 11 patients (17%) had VUR.
Renal defects in DMSA scintigraphy and the presence of VUR were not associated
with overactive detrusor or high voiding pressures.
CONCLUSION: Overactive detrusor is a common finding after first episode of
pyelonephritis. The dysfunction may explain the development of urinary tract
infections in some children. There were no differences in the incidence of
overactive detrusor or voiding pressures in patients with and without VUR, or in 
those with and without renal defects on DMSA scintigraphy. Urodynamic study is
not a primary investigation in pyelonephritic children.

Author information:

Rafiqui Shaheed Road, Karachi 75530, Pakistan.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of renal parenchymal damage following
percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) in children.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-six children undergoing PCNL in 60 renal units
between January 2000 and December 2004 were included in this prospective study,
and were subjected to postoperative technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid
((99m)Tc-DMSA). Using a standard questionnaire, demographics, number, size and
location of stones, procedure details, outcome as indicated by clearance with
PCNL alone or additional procedures, and follow up were documented. Presence of
focal renal damage and its association with the PCNL tract were examined.
RESULTS: Out of 60 renal units, cortical defects on (99m)Tc-DMSA scan were seen
in 10 renal units (17%). In three of these kidneys, the site of focal defect
corresponded to the access site for tract formation during PCNL. Two additional
kidneys had scarring at multiple sites, one of which corresponded to the access
site during PCNL. In the remaining five kidneys no association between focal
renal damage and nephrostomy tract site could be ascertained. No association was 
seen between renal damage and the size of nephroscope used during PCNL.
CONCLUSION: There exists a risk of focal damage to renal parenchyma from the
formation of the nephrostomy tract. In our series, focal damage was seen in 5% of
patients; this may be an overestimate since preoperative (99m)Tc-DMSA scans were 
not available for our patients. Meticulous technique is important combined with a
smaller nephroscope to minimize renal damage. Long-term follow up of such
children is required to assess how many are left with permanent renal scars.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical factors that influence the outcome of
endoscopically treated primary grade III and IV vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Excluding secondary VUR and patients with incomplete
follow up, a retrospective and prospective cohort observational study was
performed on 90 children (130 renal units) with primary grade III or IV reflux
treated endoscopically with Polytef or Macroplastique from March 1997 to January 
2004. All patients underwent voiding cystourethrography (or galactose-based
sonocystourethrography), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, renal ultrasound
and clinical exploration of micturition. Data were collected on age, gender,
urinary tract infection (UTI), bilaterality, renal scarring, voiding dysfunction,
and success rate. A new factor was defined, ureteral dilatation of the renal unit
(not related to grade according to findings of pelvi-calyceal images), and graded
by a single pediatric urologist blinded to its International Classification
grade.
RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio of patients was 2.91. Reflux was bilateral in
44.4%. There was UTI at presentation in 64 cases, and 21 newborns had been
prenatally diagnosed (ratio M/F 5.2:1). We found a strong relation between the
incidence of renal scarring at presentation and voiding dysfunction (P<0.01).
Cure rate at first injection was 64%. While univariate analysis appeared to show 
a strong association between resolution at first injection and bilaterality,
voiding dysfunction, nephropathy and ureteral dilatation grade, with simultaneous
logistic regression, the only statistically significant predictor was the
presence of high-grade dilatation vs low ureteral dilatation (P<0.001; OR 0.045; 
95% CI 0.01-0.16). Progression of renal damage was noted especially in patients
with voiding dysfunction (P=0.053), bilaterality (P=0.034), and severe ureteral
dilatation (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between success rate of endoscopic treatment and
grade of ureteral dilatation is demonstrated. Other factors significantly
involved in the resolution of VUR are voiding dysfunctional syndrome,
bilateralism of reflux, and scarring on initial DMSA. Gender, age, number of
infections during follow up and prenatal diagnosis do not influence the outcome
of endoscopic treatment.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To estimate the results of treatment of vesicoureteral refluxes
(VUR) in children. 156 children were involved into the study. 68 children aged 10
years and above (mean age 13.1 +/- 2.4 years) were analysed in detail. The
patients were divided into groups depending on method of treatment: surgical (26 
children), transurethral injection of teflon/collagen (11 children), conservative
(31 children). The results of treatment were evaluated on basis of subsidence of 
VUR, kidney function, renal scarring on DMSA scan and arterial hypertension.
RESULTS: Persistence of VUR was observed in 6 patients treated conservatively
(19.4%), 5 of them had voiding disturbances, in 1 patient treated with injections
(9.1%) and in no operated patients. There was no significant difference between
groups in kidney function and in presence of hypertension. Operated patients had 
significantly higher grade of VUR and grade of renal scarring on DMSA scan.
CONCLUSION: Method of treatment of vesicoureteral refluxes does not influence
kidney function or occurence of hypertension.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) could present with different clinical forms
dependent on intensity and localization of infection and child's age. The
symptoms could be non specific in children. Condition that provoke to urinary
stasis, especially voiding dysfunction is the favourable factor for UTI
appearance. Gram-negative enteric bacteria is the most common pathogen. Urine
culture is the basic investigation that allow to identify pathogen and its drug
sensitiveness but simultaneous urinalysis is necessary to recognize the
inflammation of urinary organs. In addition, the number of leukocytes gives an
idea about inflammation intensity. Ultrasonographic (USG) scan is necessary to
examine urostasis. DMSA study performed during febrile UTI allow to identify
children with acute pyelonephritis and when repeated 6 months later - those with 
renal scars. A normal USG and DMSA scan during infection makes voiding
cystourethrography (VCU) unnecessary in the primary examination. The presence of 
vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) not always predispose children to renal lesions.
Early and appropriate treatment of UTI, especially during the first 24 hours,
diminishes the likelihood of renal involvement during the acute phase of
infection but does not prevent scar formation. The proper hygiene of the urethral
meatus, voiding and drinking habits and preventing of constipation are crucial in
UTI prophylaxis.

This study compares the accuracy of 99mTc(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc(V)-DMSA) Single Photon Emission Computer Tomography (SPECT) by intravenous
or local injection in the detection of occult cervical lymph node metastases in
clinically N0 squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Fifty-eight previously 
untreated patients without clinically detectable cervical metastases were
included in the study and were divided into two groups. Twenty-eight patients
were in the intravenous injection group and 30 patients were in the local
injection (around primary tumors) group. Both groups received 99mTc(V)-DMSA, and 
99mTc(V)-DMSA SPECT was performed on all patients. All isolated lymph nodes in
neck dissection specimens were stained using H & E. The sensitivity, specificity,
and accuracy for intravenous injection of 99mTc(V)-DMSA was 62.5%, 95.0%, and
85.7%, respective, and 84.6%, 82.4%, and 83.3%, respectively, for local
injection. SPECT scan of 99mTc(V)-DMSA injected around the tumor is a simple and 
efficient approach to detecting metastatic lymph nodes in clinically N0 patients 
with oral cancer.

In order to establish the most reliable marker for distinguishing urinary tract
infections (UTI) with and without renal parenchymal involvement (RPI), we
recorded the clinical features and admission leukocyte count, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum procalcitonin (PCT)
in 57 children (including 43 girls) aged 2-108 months admitted with a first
episode of UTI. RPI was evaluated by Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy within 7 days of admission. To establish cut-off points for ESR,
CRP, and PCT, we used receiver operating characteristics curves and compared the 
area under the curve for ESR, CRP, and PCT. Twenty-seven children were diagnosed 
as having RPI based on positive renal scintigraphy. A body temperature of >38
degrees C, a history of diarrhea, and poor oral intake were more common in
patients with RPI. ESR, CRP, and PCT, but not leukocyte count, were significantly
higher in patients with RPI (P < 0.001). PCT was more sensitive and specific for 
the diagnosis of upper versus lower UTI than ESR and CRP. Using a cut-off value
of 0.85 ng/ml, PCT had the best performance, with sensitivity, specificity, and
positive and negative predictive values of 89%, 97%, 96%, and 91% respectively.
Serum PCT is a better marker than ESR, CRP, and leukocyte count for the early
prediction of RPI in children with a first episode of UTI.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) frequently recurs and increases the risk of renal
scarring even in infants with normal urinary tracts. Our study was aimed to find 
preventive measures for recurrent UTI in these infants. One-hundred ninety
infants, who were diagnosed with their first febrile UTI and were proven to have 
normal urinary systems, were enrolled. We investigated the incidence of recurrent
UTI during the following year and the following risk factors: gender, young age, 
phimosis, vaginal reflux, and acute pyelonephritis (APN) diagnosed by
99m-technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA)(+) scintigraphy. The
incidence of recurrent UTI was 21.1%. The difference in recurrence rate according
to gender was not significant. The recurrence rate in infants less than 6 months 
of age was 25.8%, which was significantly higher than the 7.7% in older infants
(P = 0.045). In male infants with persistent non-retractile prepuces, recurrent
UTI developed in 34.0%, which was significantly higher than the 17.6% in male
infants with retractile prepuces (P = 0.022). The presence of APN in male infants
increased the likelihood of recurrent UTI when analyzed by multivariate logistic 
regression [odds ratio 4.6, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.6-13.0, P =
0.003]. The presence of vaginal reflux and APN in female infants gave no
significant difference to the incidence of recurrent UTI. In infants with normal 
urinary systems, age less than 6 months, non-retractile prepuces and APN in male 
infants, were the most important risk factors for recurrent UTIs. It is suggested
that non-retractile prepuces should be adequately treated to become retractile in
young male infants with APN.

Crete, Greece.

AIM: To evaluate the role of pentavalent Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid [Tc-99m
(V) DMSA] in the diagnosis of ischemic colitis.
METHODS: Fourteen patients with endoscopically and histologically confirmed
ischemic colitis were included in the study. Tc-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy was
performed within 2 d after colonoscopy. Images were considered positive when an
area of increased activity was observed in the region of interest and negative
when no abnormal tracer uptake was detected.
RESULTS: In 3 out of the 14 patients, Tc-99m (V) DMSA images showed moderate
activity in the bowel. The scintigraphic results corresponded with the endoscopic
findings. In the other 11 patients, no abnormal tracer uptake was detected in the
abdomen.
CONCLUSION: Besides the limited number of patients, Tc-99m (V) DMSA could not be 
considered as a useful imaging modality for the evaluation of ischemic colitis.

infection: a possible predictor of acute pyelonephritis.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important pro-inflammatory
cytokine expressed at sites of inflammation. We have assessed this factor (MIF)
in urinary tract infections with the aim of determining a non-invasive and
sensitive method to differentiate upper and lower renal involvement. Thirty-three
pediatric patients with urinary track infection (25 with acute pyelonephritis,
eight with acute cystitis) and 40 healthy subjects were recruited for this
prospective case-control study. Pyelonephritis was differentiated from cystitis
by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Urinary MIF concentration was determined 
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The urine MIF/creatinine (Cr) 
ratio was significantly higher in pyelonephritis patients than in those with
acute cystitis and the control group (P < 0.001). The optimal cut-point of 4.90
pg/micromol Cr for the urine MIF/Cr ratio has the potential to be a biomarker for
distinguishing patients with acute pyelonephritis from those with acute cystitis.
Determination of the urinary MIF was also useful in selecting the patients at
risk of permanent renal damage. Of those patients with pyelonephritis, based on
the DMSA scan at the time of infection, scarring on follow-up DMSA scan 9-12
months later occurred in patients with the highest urinary MIF/Cr ratios. We
conclude that the urine MIF/Cr ratio is a sensitive test for differentiating
acute pyelonephritis from acute cystitis and also for detecting children with
acute pyelonephritis who are at a higher risk for permanent renal scars in the
future.

INTRODUCTION: Intravenous injection of mercury has seldom been reported,
especially in cases of attempted suicide, and is associated with variable
clinical outcomes.
CASE REPORT: A young woman came to our attention after self-injecting and
ingesting mercury drawn from 37 thermometers. The patient suffered lung
embolization complicated by adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), toxic
dermatitis, anemia, mild hepato-renal impairment, and died after 30 days. Mercury
was monitored in biological fluids (blood, plasma, urine, and bronchoalveolar
fluid) to study its toxicokinetics and to evaluate dose-effect relationships. Its
urinary clearance significantly increased after a chelation challenge test with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) (median values of 2.48 and 8.85 before
and after the test, respectively, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Mercury poisoning by intravenous injection is a clinical emergency, 
potentially leading to death. When injected, the element has a very slow
clearance, mainly renal. Our data do not allow any conclusion about the
effectiveness of chelation therapy.

There is ongoing controversy regarding the association between vesicoureteric
reflux (VUR), recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI), and renal damage. Despite
this, routine work up for VUR is still recommended after febrile UTI in most
children. The present article reviews the indications and imaging modalities
available for VUR diagnosis. Alternative newer techniques like MR cystography and
voiding urosonography are discussed. The increasing evidence of the role of DMSA 
scans in managing children with VUR is highlighted.

Influence of pigment substitution on the electrochemical properties of
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 601 reaction centers.

With the help of pigment substitution, self-assembled monolayer film and square
wave voltammetry, the influence of pigment substitution on the electrochemical
properties of Rhodobacter sphaeroides 601 reaction centers was investigated.
Results showed that the charge separation could also be driven by externally
electric field, similar to the primary photochemical reaction in purple bacterial
reaction center. On the surface of Au electrode, a self-assembled monolayer film 
(the RC-PDDA-DMSA film) was made up of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),
poly-dimethyldiallylammonium chloride (PDDA) and reaction center (RC). When
square wave voltammetry was used to study the RC-PDDA-DMSA film, four redox pairs
in the photochemical reaction of RC were observed by changing frequency. With
nonlinear fitting, the standard potential of P/P(+) and the corresponding
electrode reaction rate constant were determined to be 0.522 V and 13.04 S(-1),
respectively. It was found that the redox peak at -0.02 V changed greatly when
bacteriopheophytin was substituted by plant pheophytin in the reaction center.
Further studies indicated that this change resulted from the decrease in electron
transfer rate between Bphe(-)/Bphe (Phe(-)/Phe) and Q(A) (-)/Q(A) after pigment
substitution. After investigations of spectra and electrochemical properties of
different RCs and comparisons of different function groups of pigments, it was
indicated that the phytyl tail, similar to other substituted groups of
pheophytin, affected the efficiencies of pigment substitution.

CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Studies using radionuclides are the most appropriate
method for estimating renal function. Dimercaptosuccinic acid chelate labeled
with technetium-99m (99mTc-DMSA) is the radiopharmaceutical of choice for
high-resolution imaging of the renal cortex and estimation of the functional
renal mass. The aim of this study was to evaluate a simplified method for
determining the absolute renal uptake (ARU) of 99mTc-DMSA prior to nephrectomy,
using the radioactivity counts of nephrectomy specimens as the gold standard.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective study at the Division of Nuclear Medicine,
Department of Radiology, Universidade Estadual de Campinas.
METHODS: Seventeen patients (12 females; range 22-82 years old; mean age 50.8
years old) underwent nephrectomy for various reasons. Renal scintigraphy was
performed three to four hours after intravenous administration of a mean dose of 
188.7 MBq (5.1 mCi) of 99mTc-DMSA, which was done six to 24 hours before surgery.
The in vivo renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA was determined using the radioactivity of 
the syringe before the injection (measured using a dose calibrator) and the
images of the syringe and kidneys, obtained from a scintillation camera. After
surgery, the reference value for renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA was determined by
measuring the radioactivity of the nephrectomy specimen using the same dose
calibrator.
RESULTS: The ARU measurements were very similar to those obtained using the
reference method, as determined by linear regression (r-squared = 0.96).
CONCLUSION: ARU estimation using the proposed method before nephrectomy seems to 
be accurate and feasible for routine use.

The aim of this study was to assess the association between the transforming
growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) gene polymorphisms rs1800469 (commonly known as
T-509C) and rs1982073 (commonly known as Leu (10)-->Pro) and primary
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and renal scarring. Using a case-control approach, we
examined 121 children with primary VUR and 169 controls. Genotyping of the
TGF-beta1 gene polymorphisms was performed by restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The (99m)Tc-DMSA- or (99m)Tc-unitiol-single photon 
emission computed tomography method was used to evaluate renal scars in 84 of 121
VUR children. Statistical analysis revealed differences in rs1800469 genotype
frequencies between VUR patients and controls (p = 0.0021). Our data demonstrate 
that individuals homozygous for the TT genotype are at risk of primary VUR [odds 
ratio (95% confidence interval) = 2.7 (1.46-5.08)]. Distribution of the rs1982073
polymorphism was similar in VUR children and controls. In terms of renal
scarring, patients were stratified into non-scar and scar subgroups, and no
differences in the genotype frequencies of either polymorphism was found.
Previous reports have shown that the TT genotype of the rs1800469 polymorphism is
a risk factor for renal scarring in primary VUR, and the results of our study
suggest that this same polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to this
congenital uropathy.

Value of comprehensive renal ultrasound in children with acute urinary tract
infection for assessment of renal involvement: comparison with DMSA scintigraphy 
and final diagnosis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of comprehensive renal ultrasound
(US), i.e., combining greyscale US and amplitude-coded color Doppler sonography
(aCDS), for assessment of urinary tract infection (UTI) in infants and children, 
compared to (1) (99m)Tc DMSA scintigraphy and (2) final diagnosis. Two hundred
eighty-seven children with UTI underwent renal comprehensive US and DMSA
scintigraphy. The results were compared with regard to their reliability to
diagnose renal involvement, using (1) DMSA scintigraphy and (2) final diagnosis
as the gold standard. Sixty-seven children clinically had renal involvement.
Sensitivity increased from 84.1% using only aCDS to 92.1% for the combined US
approach, using DMSA scintigraphy as the reference standard. When correlated with
the final diagnosis, sensitivity for DMSA scintigraphy was 92.5%; sensitivity for
comprehensive US was 94.0%. Our data demonstrate an increasing sensitivity using 
the combination of renal greyscale US supplemented by aCDS for differentiation of
upper from lower UTI. Sensitivity for DMSA and comprehensive US was similar for
both methods compared to the final diagnosis. Comprehensive US should gain a more
important role in the imaging algorithm of children with acute UTI, thereby
reducing the radiation burden.

INTRODUCTION: The congenital obstruction of the pieloureteral junction (UPJ) is
the most frequent cause of hydronephrosis in children. Sometimes, establishing
the convenience of a surgical procedure is difficult, mainly if we consider the
literature published on the spontaneous resolution of the slight, moderate and
even severe hydronephrosis in newborns.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prognostic value of ultrasound in the evolution of
the unilateral hydronephrosis, by assesing the size of the contralateral kidney. 
To verify if the "supranormal" renal function (SRF) is real or an artefact.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have performed a descriptive observational study over a 
10 years period (1995-2005). The study included all patients with the only
diagnosis of obstructive unilateral hydronephrosis that underwent pieloplasty,
and were controlled for 1 year period after the surgical treatment.
RESULTS: Of the 66 patients in the study, 42 were boys (63.6%) and 24 girls
(36.4%). After the first diuretic renogram (DR), in 57 of the patients (86.4%)
the clearance half-time (T1/2) was over 20 minutes, in 6 cases (9.1%) it was
10-20 minutes and only in 3 cases it was shorter than 10 minutes. A similar
differential renal function (FRD) was observed in the moderate and severe
hydronephrosis. Supranormal function (FRD > 52%) was detected on DR in 11
patients, predominating in left hidronefrosis, and in more than 50% of the cases 
this value it did not agree with the renal function measured by
dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA), Pearson's correlation coefficient: 0.19. These
kidneys experienced a greater reduction of the postoperative renal function.
CONCLUSIONS: In the unilateral obstructive hydronephrosis, the healthy
contralateral kidney experiences hypertrophy detectable by ultrasound, but these 
ecographic diameters are within the band of individual confidence of the healthy 
children of reference. The supranormal function exists, but in most cases it is
an artefact.

reflux.

We evaluated the predictors of renal scar in children with urinary tract
infections (UTIs) having primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Data of patients
who were examined by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy between 1995 and
2005 were evaluated retrospectively. Gender, age, reflux grade,
presence/development of scarring, breakthrough UTIs, and resolution of reflux,
were recorded. The relation of gender, age and VUR grade to preformed scarring
and the relation of gender, age, VUR grade, presence of preformed scarring,
number of breakthrough UTIs and reflux resolution to new scarring were assessed. 
There were 138 patients [male/female (M/F) 53/85]. Multivariate analysis showed
that male gender [odds ratio (OR) 2.5], age > or = 27 months in girls (OR 4.2)
and grades IV-V reflux (OR 12.4) were independent indicators of renal scarring.
On the other hand, only the presence of previous renal scarring was found to be
an independent indicator for the development of new renal scar (OR 13.4). In
conclusion, while the most predictive variables for the presence of renal
scarring among children presenting with a UTI were male gender, age > or = 27
months in girls, and grades IV-V reflux, the best predictor of new scar formation
was presence of previous renal scarring.

Primary vesicoureteric reflux in Nepalese children.

Shrestha S(1), Basukala S, Pokhrel N.

Author information: 
(1)Patan Hospital, Lalitpur, Nepal. shri_rishi@hotmail.com

BACKGROUND: Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is a common urinary tract abnormality
observed in children with urinary tract infection and children with VUR are at
risk of reflux nephropathy and renal parenchymal damage. In Nepal, till date
there are no published series of VUR in children.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To study the incidence of VUR in Nepalese children with
Urinary tract infection (UTI), to analyze the age and sex wise distribution and
clinical course of children with VUR together with the rate of spontaneous
resolution of VUR in children
METHODOLOGY: A retrospective hospital based study conducted at Department of
Paediatrics Patan Hospital from June 2002 to December 2005. Hospital record files
of all the children undergoing micturating cystourethrography (MCUG) as part of
UTI work up were traced and the files of children with positive VUR were
separated and analyzed.
RESULTS: Over the 3 and a half years study period total 145 micturating
cystourethrograph were done in children with UTI, out of which 35(24%) were
positive for VUR. Among the children with VUR, the most common age group was
between two to twelve months and the male female ratio was 1.2:1.More than 60%
had bilateral VUR and bilateral grade II VUR was the most common finding. Renal
scan (DMSA) was done in only 5 cases and out of those two showed renal scaring.
Eight cases underwent repeat MCUG after 1-1 1/2 years and spontaneous resolution 
of VUR was seen in 5 (62.5%) cases. Six cases were lost in follow up, 5 cases
went for surgical intervention.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of VUR in children with UTI in our part is almost
comparable to western data. Children with VUR need regular and long term
follow-up.

Three magnetic fluid (MF) samples containing gamma-Fe2O3 (maghemite)
nanoparticles surface-coated with either meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),
citric acid or lauric acid were prepared, characterized, and assessed for their
cytotoxic potential on the human SK-MEL-37 melanoma cell line. Ultra-structural
analysis was also performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In
vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated by the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The
inhibitory concentration (IC50) derived from the sigmoidal dose response curve
was 254 microg-iron/mL (95% confidence interval 239-270 microg-iron/mL) for
lauric acid-coated nanoparticles. DMSA-coated nanoparticles did not exhibit a
clear trend toward toxicity (IC50 value is more than 2260 +/- 50 microg-iron/mL) 
and the IC50 value was about 433 +/- 14 microg-iron/mL for citric-acid coated
nanoparticles. The cytotoxic response correlated with both the hydrodynamic
diameter and the zeta potential suggests that the chain length of the carboxylic 
acid of the coating species may influence metabolic cellular process. Also the
assayed nanoparticles can be considered non-cytotoxic to human melanoma cells
since IC50 values are higher than plasma concentration usually observed in
clinical use of contrast agents. Using TEM we verified that all assayed
nanoparticles were internalized by cells through endocytic vesicles.
Additionally, cells treated with lauric acid-coated nanoparticles at high
concentration (588 or 840 microg-iron/mL) displayed morphological features of
apoptosis (surface blebbing, intense vacuolization and chromatin condensation) or
a typical DNA ladder pattern when analyzed by TEM or agarose gel electrophoresis,
respectively. Apoptotic events may be operative, suggesting a promising
therapeutic application for the lauric acid-coated nanoparticle in the treatment

INTRODUCTION: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is an uncommon and potentially
serious mucocutaneous disease. The most important step in the management of SJS
is early recognition and immediate withdrawal of the causative agent. We present 
a patient with SJS associated with dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) therapy.
CASE REPORT: An asymptomatic 11-year old boy who had been exposed chronically to 
mercury vapour had a 24-hour urine mercury concentration of 37 microgram/L
(reference value <10 microgram/L). Exposure to the mercury vapour was stopped and
treatment with oral DMPS was begun. After two weeks of therapy, he developed a
disseminated cutaneous eruption of red pruritic macules on his chest and back,
which three days later had spread all over his body with the discrete maculae
becoming confluent; erosions and crusts developed on his lips and he had blisters
in his mouth. The diagnosis of SJS was made, the DMPS was stopped, and the SJS
resolved gradually.
DISCUSSION: Chelation agents like DMPS or DMSA are increasingly used and are
available over the counter in some countries. These drugs are used in patients
with complaints that are attributed to mercury-containing dental amalgams and in 
children with autism.
CONCLUSION: The reported association suggests that SJS may be a potential
complication of DMPS therapy, and this should be considered in the risk-benefit
analysis of chelation. The reported association suggests that SJS may be a
potential complication of DMPS therapy, and this should be considered in the
risk-benefit analysis of chelation.

The compatible-solute-binding protein OpuAC from Bacillus subtilis: ligand
binding, site-directed mutagenesis, and crystallographic studies.

In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, five transport systems work in concert
to mediate the import of various compatible solutes that counteract the
deleterious effects of increases in the osmolarity of the environment. Among
these five systems, the ABC transporter OpuA, which catalyzes the import of
glycine betaine and proline betaine, has been studied in detail in the past.
Here, we demonstrate that OpuA is capable of importing the sulfobetaine
dimethylsulfonioacetate (DMSA). Since OpuA is a classic ABC importer that relies 
on a substrate-binding protein priming the transporter with specificity and
selectivity, we analyzed the OpuA-binding protein OpuAC by structural and
mutational means with respect to DMSA binding. The determined crystal structure
of OpuAC in complex with DMSA at a 2.8-A resolution and a detailed mutational
analysis of these residues revealed a hierarchy within the amino acids
participating in substrate binding. This finding is different from those for
other binding proteins that recognize compatible solutes. Furthermore, important 
principles that enable OpuAC to specifically bind various compatible solutes were
uncovered.

Comparison of differential renal function using technetium-99m
mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) and technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
renography in a paediatric population.

BACKGROUND: In children who have undergone both 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-MAG3 studies
for the assessment of differential renal function (DRF) and drainage,
respectively, we have noticed good agreement between the calculated DRF values,
and hypothesized that there is no significant difference in DRF values calculated
from these tests. Therefore, both tests may not always be necessary.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a statistically significant difference
between DRF values calculated using 99mTc-DMSA and those calculated using
99mTc-MAG3.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified children imaged with
99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-MAG3. We recorded DRF values, age, indication, and renal
pelvis diameter. For the 99mTc-DMSA studies we recorded the imaging time after
injection. For the 99mTc-MAG3 studies we recorded the delay between injection and
data acquisition, diuretic use and evidence of delayed drainage or reflux.
RESULTS: We identified 100 episodes in 92 children where both 99mTc-DMSA and
99mTc-MAG3 scans had been performed within a few days. The commonest indication
was urinary tract infection or pelviureteric junction obstruction. The mean age
of the children was 6.96 years. A significant but clinically acceptable trend was
seen between abnormal DRF and difference between tests. A significant link was
found with the difference between tests and the time of imaging after DMSA
injection, and also with scarring. No significant effect was caused by renal
pelvis dilatation, delayed drainage, frusemide administration, or delayed
99mTc-MAG3 imaging.
CONCLUSION: If a 99mTc-MAG3 study has been performed then a 99mTc-DMSA study is
unnecessary provided DRF is normal on the 99mTc-MAG3 study and there is no
scarring. A change in practice would lead to considerable savings in time, cost
and radiation burden.

MRP2 and the DMPS- and DMSA-mediated elimination of mercury in TR(-) and control 
rats exposed to thiol S-conjugates of inorganic mercury.

Cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy)-S-conjugates of inorganic mercury (Hg2+)
are transportable species of Hg2+ that are taken up readily by proximal tubular
cells. The metal chelators, 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS) and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), have been used successfully to extract
Hg2+ from these cells, presumably via the multidrug resistance protein (Mrp2). In
the current study, we tested the hypothesis that Mrp2 is involved in the DMPS-
and DMSA-mediated extraction of Hg2+ following administration of Hg2+ as an
S-conjugate of Cys or Hcy. To test this hypothesis, control and TR(-)
(Mrp2-deficient) rats were injected with 0.5 micromol/kg HgCl2 (containing
203Hg2+) conjugated to 1.25 micromol/kg Cys or Hcy. After 24 and 28 h, rats were 
treated with saline or 100 mg/kg DMPS or DMSA. Tissues were harvested 48 h after 
Hg2+ exposure. The renal and hepatic burden of Hg2+ was greater in
saline-injected TR- rats than in corresponding controls. Accordingly, the content
of Hg2+ in the urine and feces was less in TR- rats than in controls. Following
treatment with DMPS or DMSA, the renal content of Hg2+ in both groups of rats was
reduced significantly and the urinary excretion of Hg2+ was increased. In liver, 
the effect of each chelator appeared to be dependent upon the form in which Hg2+ 
was administered. In vitro experiments provide direct evidence indicating that
DMPS and DMSA-S-conjugates of Hg2+ are substrates for Mrp2. Overall, these data
support our hypothesis that Mrp2 is involved in the DMPS and DMSA-mediated
extraction of the body burden of Hg2+.

PURPOSE: We investigated the functional consequences of relieving ureteric
obstruction in young pigs with experimental hydronephrosis (HN) induced by
partial unilateral ureteropelvic obstruction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups of animals were followed from the age of 2
weeks to the age of 14 weeks: Eight animals had severe or grades 3-4 HN
throughout the study. Six animals had relief of the obstruction after 4 weeks.
Six animals received sham operations at both ages. Morphological and functional
examinations were performed at age 6 weeks and again at age 14 weeks and
consisted of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
technetium-diethylenetriaminepentaaceticacid ((99m)Tc-DTPA) renography, renal
technetium-dimercaptosuccinicacid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy, and glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) measurement.
RESULTS: After relief of the partial obstruction, there was reduction of the
pelvic diameter and improvement of urinary drainage. Global and relative kidney
function was not significantly affected by either obstruction or its relief.
Renal (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy showed a change in both the appearance of the
kidney and a change in the distribution within kidneys even after relief of
obstruction.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that partial ureteric obstruction in young pigs may 
be associated with little effect on global and differential kidney function.
However, even after relief of HN, the distribution of (99m)Tc-DMSA in the kidney 
remains abnormal suggesting that a normal differential renal function may not
represent a normal kidney.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux are 
the most frequent entities identified on the basis of antenatal hydronephrosis.
The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and pattern of abnormal
renal scintigraphy findings in postnatal investigation of children with antenatal
hydronephrosis.
METHODS: Twenty-four infants (19 boys and five girls) presented with antenatal
hydronephrosis and mild to moderate hydronephrosis on ultrasound in newborn
period were referred for renal scintigraphy. Ten patients with vesicoureteral
reflux documented on micturating cystoureterography underwent 99mTc-DMSA renal
scintigraphy and 14 patients were subjected to 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy.
RESULTS: Anteroposterior pelvic diameter on ultrasound ranged from 11 to 24 mm.
Renal DMSA scans identified congenital scars in two boys with bilateral reflux of
grade V and unilateral reflux of grade III. Relative kidney uptake (RKU) less
than 40% was found in three, and poor kidney function (RKU less than 10%) in two 
patients. Significant obstruction was shown on DTPA diuretic renal scintigraphy
in 6/14 patients. Some slowing in dranaige (T1/2 greater than 10 minutes) with no
reduction in differential renal function was identified in three patients.
Differential renal function less than 10% was obtained in one case.
CONCLUSION: A high percent of abnormal renal scintigraphy findings was obtained. 
Renal scintigraphy was useful in determination of underlying cause of antenatally
detected hydronephrosis.

[Determination of renal function at the end of the follow-up period in children
with vesicoureteral reflux].

OBJECTIVES: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been associated, since the old times,
with chronic renal failure (CRF). Nevertheless, some functional parameters may be
altered before glomerular filtration rate deteriorates, such as maximum urinary
osmolality (Uosm) and urinary excretion of microalbumin.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied the records of 77 children (37 males and 14
females; 48% and 52% respectively) with the diagnosis of VUR that were cured at
the time of the study and were two years old or older (6.28 +/- 3.75; range: 2-16
years). In addition to Uosm and urinary excretion of microalbumin, the grade of
VUR, creatinine levels, GFR, and morphological anomalies detected in 99Tc
dimercaptosuccinate gammagrams (DMSA) were collected.
RESULTS: Only four patients had moderate CREF. No differences in Uosm values were
observed according to VUR grade. All children with grade I and II VUR had a
normal renal concentration test. A long-term concentration defect was observed in
15 children, six with grade III, 8 with grade IV and 1 with grade V. Only 2
patients with normal DMSA had reduced Uosm. Uosm had a direct correlation with
GFR (r = 0.6; p < 0.001). Regarding urinary excretion of microalbumin, elevated
values were found in 11 children, one with grade II, four with grade III, and six
with grade IV. Only four patients with normal DMSA showed microalbumin values
over the normal range. A negative correlation between osmolality levels and
microalbumin/creatinine quotient was observed (r = - 0.37; p < 0.001). In
comparison with patients with normal DMSA, patients with bilateral scars showed
significantly lower values of Uosm and GFR.
CONCLUSIONS: At the end of the follow-up period we observed a defect on
concentration capacity in 19.5% and increase of microalbuminuria in 14.3% of the 
children with the diagnosis of VUR. The frequency of CRF in our series is very
low (5.1%). The observed renal tubular function deterioration is more in relation
with the loss of renal parenchyma than the initial grade of VUR.

OBJECTIVES: Although vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a very frequent pathology in 
the pediatric age and represents an important part of the activity of
pediatricians, pediatric urologists, nephrologists, and radiologists, yet there
is controversy about its global management both in diagnosis and treatment. The
objective of this paper is to perform an update in the use of different imaging
techniques in the diagnosis and followup of VUR and to propose a work up
protocol.
METHODS: We describe the imaging techniques: VCUG, ultrasound, intravenous
urography, bladder-ultrasound, DMSA, MRI, and their role in the evaluation and
followup of VUR. We performed a bibliographic review about the topic and present 
the experience of our working group on VUR.
RESULTS: The bibliographic review shows a clear evolution of the concepts of VUR 
and also the management algorithms. The concepts of congenital renal lesion
without urinary tract infection (UTI) or acquired lesion after UTI are clearly
differentiated in the most recent reviews. Reflux is passing from being the
center of the problem to a secondary phenomenon in relation to UTI, and this is
leading to a change of diagnostic strategy, less and less invasive.
CONCLUSIONS: VCUG has been to date the first and indisputable technique for the
management of VUR, mainly in the diagnostic phase, but technological advances in 
the area of ultrasound (ultrasound contrasts, harmonic image, etc.) have
converted ultrasound in the first imaging technique for the management of VUR in 
pediatric age. On the other hand, work-up algorithms have changed due to the
great impact prenatal diagnosis is having in the management of urinary tract
anomalies.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of spot urine creatinine
concentration (UCC) as a new test for the evaluation of differential renal
function in obstructed kidneys (DRF(ok)) drained by percutaneous nephrostomy tube
(PCNT).
METHODS: In patients with obstructed kidneys drained by PCNT, DRF(ok) was derived
from UCC by comparing the value of UCC in the obstructed kidney to the value in
the contralateral kidney, and was derived from dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
renal scans and creatinine clearance (CCr) using standard methods. Subsequently, 
the results of UCC were compared to the results of DMSA and CCr.
RESULTS: 61 patients were enrolled. Bland-Altman plots to compare DMSA and UCC
showed that the upper limit of agreement was 14.8% (95% CI 10.7-18.5) and the
lower limit was -19.9% (95% CI -23.8 to -16.1). The sensitivity and specificity
of detecting DMSA DRF(ok) < or = 35% using UCC was 85.2 and 91.2%, respectively. 
When UCC was compared to CCr, Bland-Altman tests gave an upper limit of agreement
of 10.4% (95% CI 7.9-12.8) and a lower limit of agreement of -11.3% (95% CI -13.8
to -8.9).
CONCLUSIONS: UCC is accurate in the estimation of DRF(ok) drained by PCNT.

AIM: To develop a prediction model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) for 
the treatment selection in vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
METHODS: A total of 96 children with VUR (145 ureteric units (UU)) were treated
at our institution during 2004-2006. An ANN based on quick propagation
architecture was created with the commercially available software package. The
patients' age and sex, the cause and grade of VUR, the affected ureter, the type 
of treatment (conservative, subureteric injection, or open surgery), existence of
renal scar on DMSA, follow-up times and the number of injections were used as
variables. These data were also transferred to a statistical software package and
regression analysis was done.
RESULTS: In all, 105 UU showed no reflux, 5 UU showed improvements in reflux
grade (considered only in the conservative management group), and the remaining
35 UU showed persistence. In the training group (n = 99), ANN showed 98.5%
sensitivity, 92.5% specificity, 97% positive predictive value, and 96% negative
predictive value in predicting treatment outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that ANN can accurately predict the resolution 
of VUR, and thus could be useful in daily clinical practice. This approach would 
allow urologists to aid in the decision-making process of VUR treatment.

Catla catla fingerlings were reared in freshwater and exposed to 15.5 ppm
concentration of lead for 60 days. The morphological changes on the gill of the
C. catla fingerlings due to lead intoxication and the effect of DMSA (meso
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) on the affected tissues were observed using Scanning
Electron Microscope. It has been found that the lead treated gill tissues showed 
certain marked changes, such as cell hypertrophy, alteration in the lamellar
surfaces, epithelial hyperplasia and the fusion of adjacent lamellae. The
antidote DMSA treatment reduces the toxic effects and helps the recovery of gill 
tissue and its return to the level of the control/normal.

Radionuclide assessment of patients with urinary tract infection and
vesico-ureteric reflux using tc-99m-dimercaptosuccinic Acid.

Jordan.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate pediatric patients with urinary tract
infection and to identify the risk of developing renal scarring and its
relationship to the presence of vesico-ureteric reflux. The subjects in this
study were 29 pediatric patients between two months and 11 years of age with a
history of urinary tract infection among which 69% were females. All the patients
underwent radio-isotope scanning using Technetium-99-m-dimercaptosuccinic acid,
4-6 weeks after the eradication of the acute infection. Micturating
cysto-urethrography and renal ultrasound examinations were performed before the
radio-isotope scanning. Isotope scanning showed evidence of scarring in 34% of
the kidneys, while ultrasound scanning was positive in only 29% of the kidneys.
The agreement between the results of the two examinations was in 88% of the
kidneys. Reflux was noted in 53% of the kidneys of which 62% showed scarring by
isotope scanning. Only 11% of the kidneys with no reflux showed evidence of
scarring, while 92% of kidneys with severe reflux had renal scarring. In patients
with reflux, 57% of the kidneys in female patients and 50% of the kidneys in male
patients developed renal scarring evident on DMSA scanning. Absence of reflux had
a high predictive value for absence of renal scarring, while the presence of
reflux did not necessarily imply the presence of renal scarring but the
possibility increased with the severity of reflux.

DMSA renal scans and the top-down approach to urinary tract infection.

Hardy RD(1), Austin JC.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, U.T. Southwestern Medical Center,
Dallas, TX, USA.

Assessment of first febrile urinary tract infection in young children has usually
involved 2 imaging techniques: renal ultrasonogram and voiding
cystourethrography. Currently, there is growing interest in using the
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan labeled with technetium-99m as an alternative
initial study, in the evaluation of UTI. DMSA renal scanning is the most
sensitive radiologic study to detect acute pyelonephritis. Early DMSA renal
scanning has been called the top-down approach, because the focus is the
identification of kidney injury rather than reflux. Positive and negative aspects
of DMSA renal scans are discussed by a pediatric urologist.

One-, two-, and three-dimensional superstructures of gold nanorods induced by
dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Instrument Facility, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai-600 036,
India.

A method is described for assembling gold nanorods into one-, two-, and
three-dimensional superstructures. The addition of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
into the nanorod solution was found to induce self-assembly of the latter to
one-dimensional "tapelike", two-dimensional "sheetlike" and three-dimensional
"superlattice-like" structures depending on the DMSA concentration. The assembly 
was found to follow a smectic structure, where the nanorod long axes are parallel
to each other. The rods are spaced 8.5 +/- 0.3 nm apart in the resulting
structures, which extend over several micrometers in length. Organizations
perpendicular to the grid were also found. The nanorod tapes were found to bend, 
and they form circular assemblies as well. The assembly and morphology of the
nanorod structures were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and
UV-vis spectroscopy. The effect of the DMSA concentration as well as the pH of
the medium was also studied. On the basis of several control experiments
utilizing similar molecules, charge neutralization of the nanorods by the
carboxylic group of DMSA was found to be the principal reason for such an
assembly, while the mercapto groups render additional stability to its structure.
A mechanistic model of the assembly is proposed. This type of assembly would
plausibly function as a plasmonic waveguide in potential nanodevices.

underwent 18F-DOPA PET, 18F-FDG PET, DMSA-V scintigraphy, and MRI or CT. Patient-
and lesion-based sensitivities were calculated using a composite reference
consisting of all imaging modalities.
RESULTS: In 76% of all patients with MTC, one or more imaging modalities was
positive for MTC lesions. In 6 of 8 patients with a calcitonin level of <500
ng/L, imaging results were negative. In 15 patients with positive imaging
results, 18F-DOPA PET detected 13 (sensitivity, 62%; with 4.6 lesions per patient
[lpp]). Morphologic imaging (n = 19) was positive in 7 (sensitivity, 37%; 4.7
lpp), DMSA-V (n = 18) in 5 (sensitivity, 28%; 1.1 lpp), and 18F-FDG PET (n = 17) 
in 4 (sensitivity, 24%; 1.6 lpp). In a lesion-based analysis, 18F-DOPA PET
detected 95 of 134 lesions (sensitivity, 71%), morphologic imaging detected 80 of
126 (sensitivity, 64%), DMSA-V detected 20 of 108 (sensitivity, 19%), and 18F-FDG
PET detected 48 of 102 (sensitivity, 30%). In 2 of 3 patients with a
calcitonin/carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) doubling time of < or =12 mo, 18F-FDG
PET performed better than 18FDOPA PET; in the third patient, 18F-FDG PET was not 
performed.
CONCLUSION: MTC lesions are best detectable when serum calcitonin was >500 ng/L. 
18F-DOPA PET is superior to 18F-FDG PET, DMSA-V, and morphologic imaging. With
short calcitonin doubling times (< or =12 mo), 18F-FDG PET may be superior.

[Vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring].

[Article in Serbian]

Peco-Antić A.

Reflux nephropathy is an acquired focal renal scarring due to the combination of 
vesicoureteral (VUR) and intrarenal reflux (IRR) associated with urinary tract
infections (IUT) and/or permanently high intravesical pressure. Up to 30-60% of
children with VUR and a history of symptomatic IUT have renal scarring at the
time of their initial studies. The onset of renal scarring usually occurs early
in life, usually before age five years and most frequently before three years of 
age. Girls are at greater risk for developing reflux nephropathy, because of
increased incidence of IUT. Reflux nephropathy is different from a diffuse
congenital renal scarring (hypo-dysplasia), which is usually discovered
antenatally or during infancy in boys with severe VUR. Without serial follow-up
(ultrasonography, intravenous pyelourography, 99mTc-DMSA scan) from birth, it is 
not always possible to differentiate congenital renal scarring from reflux
nephropathy. In contrast to reflux nephropathy, congenital renal scarring cannot 
be prevented. 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy is the gold standard technique
(sensitivity 92%, specificity 98%) for the diagnosis of reflux nephropathy, but
ultrasound is a good modality to monitor kidney growth over time. Reflux
nephropathy and hypodysplasia are the main causes of chronic renal failure and
arterial hypertension in children and adolescents in our country. The long-term
follow-up of children with reflux nephropathy is mandatory, since its
complications may take 10 to 20 years to develop. Uncontrollable arterial
hypertension and proteinuria are the predictors of poor prognosis. The selective 
use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor
blockers is the efficient antihypertensive therapy, which also modify intrarenal 
haemodynamics and can preserve renal function.

INTRODUCTION: This study assesses long-term outcome of patients with neuropatic
bladders who underwent a bladder augmentation before puberty.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 21 patients with low compliant neuropathic
bladders who did not respond satisfactory to clean intermittent catheterization
and/or anticholinergic therapy underwent bladder augmentation (mean age 8.3 yr,
range; 2.5-12). Eighteen patients (86%) had VUR and/or ureterohydronephrosis and 
17 (81%) had DMSA renal scars. Renal function was normal in all cases except one.
All patients were followed at regular intervals with serum electrolyte and
creatinine determination, urinary tract imaging, urodynamic evaluation and
24-hour urine collection. In the 18 cases augmented with intestine, urine
cytology, cystoscopy and biopsy were also performed.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 11 yr (8-14.5) and mean age at the end of follow-up
was 19 yr (13.3-26.8). Urodynamic studies showed a significant improvement in
bladder compliance. Upper urinary tract dilatation disappeared in all patients,
VUR in 13/15p (86%) and no new renal scarring occurred. Renal function was normal
at the end of follow-up in 20. Only 1 patient had UTI and another had a bladder
stone. All patients are dry and 2 of them do not need clean intermittent
catheterization. Urine cytology and cystoscopy were normal and no malignat
lessions have been found in the biopsy specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: Bladder augmentation done pre-puberty preserves renal function and
resolves VUR and/or hydronephrosis in most cases without reimplanting the
ureters. Close lifelong follow-up, including a cystoscopy, improves the results
and prevents complications.

[Five years of renal trauma in a paediatric trauma center: new tools in the
diagnostic and therapeutic process].

INTRODUCTION: There is general agreement in the conservative management of most
renal traumas, but questions like the role of angiography are still
controversial. Our objective is to review the paediatric renal trauma
characteristics, propose a therapeutic protocol and suggest new therapeutic
tools.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical records (epidemiology,
diagnostic methods, renal injury grade according to the AAST Organ Injury Scale, 
treatment and follow up) of the paediatric renal injuries at Vail d'Hebron
Hospital in the last 5 years. Outline of a diagnostic-therapeutic protocol
consistent with the literature.
RESULTS: Since 2001, 18 cases of paediatric renal trauma have been diagnosed.
Median of age was 10 years (range 2-17). Renal injury grade was: I (4), II (5),
III (4), IV (4), V (1). Main mechanisms of injury were car and motorcicle
accidents (4), fall (3), bicycle (3) and sports (3). There were different
severity associated injuries in 10 patients. Abdominal exploration was normal in 
6 cases, and in 5 (including the grade V injury) hematuria was absent or was
microscopic. Mean hematocrit and hemoglobine were 34.5% y 11.8 g/dl. Abdominal CT
was performed in all cases, detecting injuries that were unnoticed with
ultrasound exploration. Complications were: renal artery pseudoaneurism (1),
urinoma (1), uretero-pelvic joint disruption (1), arterial hypertension (3),
renal colic (1). Management was: conservative in 13 cases, angiography in 4 (2
embolizations of bleeding vessels, 1 pseudoaneurism embolization, 1 placement of 
endovascular stents in an injury of the arterial intima), delayed surgery in 2 (1
nefrectomy, 1 uretero-pyeloplasty). All of them received prophylactic
antibiotics; 10 had self-limited fever with negative cultures. Only in 2 cases
DMSA at 6 months was inferior to 20%. There were no deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: In paediatric patients, there can be severe renal injuries despite
absence of hematuria and a normal physical exam and hemogram. Abdominal CT with
endovenous contrast is the keystone of diagnosis, and identifies vascular
injuries that might need immediate treatment, like renal ischemia. Angiography is
an important tool to consider in case of persistent bleeding or renal
infarctation.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the functional and morphological effects of
postpercutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) superselective renal angiographic
embolization.
METHODS: Between January 1995 and March 2006, superselective renal angiography
was needed to control severe bleeding after 41 of 4095 PCNL procedures (1%). We
evaluated the short-term effects of embolization after 3 months with renal
ultrasonography (RUS), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan, and estimation 
of serum creatinine. We evaluated long-term morphological and functional effects 
with RUS, DMSA renal scan, and excretory urography (IVU).
RESULTS: Bleeding was controllable with superselective embolization in 38
patients (93%). Six of them developed early postembolization complications, in
the form of perinephric hematoma in 4 and urinary leakage in 2 patients. At 3
months, serum creatinine levels increased in 3 of 9 patients with a solitary
kidney, but none required renal replacement therapy. Long-term follow-up was
completed for 30 patients for a mean period of 3.9 +/- 2.3 years. We performed
IVU for 27 patients. Among them, 2 renal units (7%) showed no dye excretion. DMSA
scans showed homogeneous distribution of radiotracer with no evidence of
photopenic areas in 6 renal units (20%). The mean percentage of DMSA uptake by
the corresponding kidney improved from 25 +/- 9% at the 3-month scans to 34 +/-
11% at the last follow-up scans (P <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The short-term deleterious effects of superselective renal
embolization for post-PCNL renal vascular injuries were more pronounced in
patients with a solitary kidney. However, the long-term follow-up showed
functional and morphological improvements.

Urine is universally recognized as one of the best non-invasive matrices for
biomonitoring exposure to a broad range of xenobiotics, including toxic metals.
Detection of metal ions in urine has been problematic due to the protein
competition and electrode fouling. For direct, simple, and field-deployable
monitoring of urinary Pb, electrochemical sensors employing superparamagnetic
iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles with a surface functionalization of
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been developed. The metal detection involves
rapid collection of dispersed metal-bound nanoparticles from a sample solution at
a magnetic or electromagnetic electrode, followed by the stripping voltammetry of
the metal in acidic medium. The sensors were evaluated as a function of solution 
pH, the binding affinity of Pb to DMSA-Fe3O4, the ratio of nanoparticles per
sample volume, preconcentration time, and Pb concentrations. The effect of
binding competitions between the DMSA-Fe3O4 and urine constituents for Pb on the 
sensor responses was studied. After 90 s of preconcentration in samples
containing 25 vol.% of rat urine and 0.1 g L(-1) of DMSA-Fe3O4, the sensor could 
detect background level of Pb (0.5 ppb) and yielded linear responses from 0 to 50
ppb of Pb, excellent reproducibility (%RSD of 5.3 for seven measurements of 30
ppb Pb), and Pb concentrations comparable to those measured by ICP-MS. The sensor
could also simultaneously detect background levels (<1 ppb) of Cd, Pb, Cu, and Ag
in river and seawater.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of background subtraction (BS) 
on estimation of differential kidney function (DF) on the static scintigraphy
with (99m)Tc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and dynamic scintigraphy with (99m)Tc
mercaptoacetyltriglicine (MAG3) and to establish possible differences between DF 
values estimated with these methods.PATIENTS, METHODS: Patients (n=106) were
selected among those scheduled to static and dynamic scintigraphies within 3
months, with no interim clinical and laboratory changes, regardless the kidney
pathology. DF was estimated according to the uptake ratio method. Four background
regions of interest (ROIs) were applied, identical for both studies, and DF
values were recalculated after BS. The corrected values were compared to the
values before correction, separately for DMSA and MAG3, and between the studies. 
The results showed that ROIs used introduce variable results for the same
patients, predominantly when noncorrected DF values were <45%. There were no
significant differences between DF values (corrected and noncorrected) obtained
from static and dynamic scintigraphy in all groups of patients. Since numerous
reasons can bring to the errors in DF estimation when BS is used, the conclusions
are that it would probably be more accurate to avoid BS, particularly when DF
values are compared in a patient follow-up, and when kidney function is normal.
BS should be used, but always in the same way, only when there is a significant
difference in kidney size, or when DF is <25%, since background activity is then 
considerable. MAG3 and DMSA can be equally used for DF estimation and their
results compared in patient follow-up.

The twin-arginine translocase (Tat) system is used for the targeting and
translocation of folded proteins across the cell membrane of most bacteria.
Substrates of this system contain a conserved "twin-arginine" (RR) motif within
their signal/leader peptide sequence. Many Tat substrates have their own
system-specific chaperone called redox enzyme maturation proteins (REMPs). Here, 
we study the binding of DmsD, the REMP for dimethyl sulfoxide reductase in
Escherichia coli, toward the RR-containing leader peptide of the catalytic
subunit DmsA. We have used a multipronged approach targeted at the amino acid
sequence of DmsD to define residues and regions important for recognition of the 
DmsA leader sequence. Residues identified through bioinformatics and THEMATICS
analysis were mutated using site-directed mutagenesis. These DmsD residue
variants were purified and screened with an in vitro dot-blot far-Western assay
to analyze the binding to the DmsA leader sequence. Degenerative polymerase chain
reaction was also used to produce a bank of random DmsD amino acid mutants, which
were then screened by an in vivo bacterial two-hybrid assay. Using this hybrid
method, each DmsD variant was classified into one of three groups based on their 
degree of interaction with the DmsA leader (none, weak, and moderate). The data
from both the in vitro and in vivo analyses were then applied to a model
structure of DmsD based on the crystal structure of the Salmonella typhimurium
homologue. Our results illustrate the positions of important DmsD residues
involved in binding the DmsA leader peptide and identify a "hot pocket" of
residues important for leader binding on the structure of DmsD.

As a critical step toward elucidating the mechanism of localization of Tc-99m (V)
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), we investigated its binding and transport in
blood in comparison with Ga-67 citrate. The studies were performed in vitro by
incubating Tc-99m (V) DMSA with blood (one sample at 4 degrees Celcius and
another at 37 degrees Celcius) to assess its binding to plasma proteins using
ultrafiltration, dialysis, electrophoresis, gel filtration chromatography and
affinity chromatography. A parallel experiment for determining the blood binding 
of Ga-67 citrate was performed using the same procedures. Using ultrafiltration, 
dialysis, electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography, labeled plasma
samples showed that protein binding for Tc-99m (V) DMSA was 45-54% at 37 degrees 
Celcius and 73-80% at 4 degrees Celcius. The figures for Ga-67 citrate were
43-53% at 37 degrees Celcius and 75-81% at 4 degrees Celcius. Electrophoresis
showed that Tc-99m (V) DMSA was mostly bound to plasma albumin (36.05 +/- 2.48%
at 37 degrees Celcius and 60.04 +/- 1.87% at 4 degrees Celcius), and that the
proportion of Ga-67 radioactivity associated with beta-globulin was 34.23 +/-
1.37% at 37 degrees Celcius and 55.71 +/- 3.69% at 4 degrees Celcius. In affinity
chromatography experiments, Tc-99m (V) DMSA did not bind to transferrin, unlike
Ga-67 citrate. This study demonstrates that, at the radiopharmaceutical tracer
level, most Tc-99m (V) DMSA in blood is protein-bound, primarily to albumin, but 
not to transferrin. In contrast, Ga-67 citrate was bound primarily to
transferrin. The knowledge that albumin is the main transport protein of Tc-99m
(V) DMSA may contribute to a better understanding of its biodistribution and
pharmacokinetics.

INTRODUCTION: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare disease. Serum
calcitonin levels and Tc-99m DMSA (V) scans are used in the follow-up of these
patients after surgical resection. We present our experience in the follow-up of 
these patients at a tertiary institution.
METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records was performed. Patients
with histologically-proven MTC, and who had serum calcitonin assays and DMSA (V) 
scans in their postoperative follow-up, were included.
RESULTS: There were 17 patients with 56 DMSA (V) scans. Four out of seven
patients with elevated preoperative calcitonin measurements had calcitonin
normalisation within six months of surgery, and have remained disease-free. Two
patients had persistently elevated calcitonin levels after six months, which
predated positive DMSA (V) scans. Results of DMSA (V) scans and serum calcitonin 
levels were concordant in 38 of 48 instances (79.2 percent) and discordant in 10 
of 48 instances (20.8 percent). Sensitivity of DMSA (V) scans for detecting
recurrence was 71.4 percent. There were no false-positive scans.
CONCLUSION: Serum calcitonin level is a sensitive and specific indicator of
disease recurrence in postoperative follow-up of patients with MTC. Early (within
six months) normalisation of calcitonin levels postsurgery may predict subsequent
disease-free status. Discordant results between serum calcitonin levels and DMSA 
(V) scans may be due to undetectable lesions and follow-up scans or alternative
radionuclide imaging may be required.

AIM: To evaluate the association between primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and 
renal scarring in children using 99 m Technetium-labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA).
METHODS: Children attending at Songklanagarind Hospital from 1987 to 2002 were
evaluated.
RESULTS: Ages at diagnosis of VUR in 46 boys and 52 girls were 1.1+/-1.6 and
2.9+/-2.5 years, median 0.6 and 2.3 years, respectively (P<0.001). DMSA scans
were performed at 4.1+/-3.6 years. Renal parenchymal damage was detected in 34
kidneys (22%) of 154 demonstrated refluxing ureters, and one kidney (2%) of 42
non-refluxing ureters (P=0.002). Of 79 refluxing ureters in boys and 75 refluxing
ureters in girls, there were 25 and nine renal scars, respectively (32% and 12%, 
P=0.003). Renal scars in VUR grades I-V were 11%, 7%, 12%, 44% and 64%,
respectively (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that high grade VUR
(P<0.001), age of diagnosis of VUR greater than 5 years (P=0.001), and male
gender (P=0.002) were the most significant risk factors for renal scarring.
CONCLUSION: High-grade VUR, age of diagnosis of VUR greater than 5 years and male
gender were the most significant risk factors for renal scarring.

A relationship between the Teflon deposit, visible with ultrasound, and long-term
success of subureteric Teflon injection (STING) treatment was investigated. The
study included only those patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), in
whom the reflux had disappeared and the Teflon deposits were visible 6 weeks
following STING treatment. Cessation of VUR was proven by voiding
cysto-urethrography (VCUG) in 99 patients (143 ureters). Average follow-up time
was 9 (4-12) years. Patients were divided into two groups: group I, deposits
visible with ultrasound [deposit (+)], and group II, no visible deposits at the
end of the follow-up period [deposit (-)]. Reflux recurrence, the occurrence of
urinary tract infection (UTI), and pyelonephritis were investigated, and
technetium scintigraphy scans were examined. The deposit (+) group included 43
patients (65 ureters), and the deposit (-) group contained 56 patients (78
ureters). In the deposit (+) group there were no recurrences of VUR; however, 17 
recurrences were found in the deposit (-) group (P < 0.05). Dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) scintigraphy scans and occurrence of UTI showed significant
difference between the groups (P < 0.05). A close relationship was found between 
the disappearance of the Teflon deposit and the recurrence of VUR. Disappearance 
of the Teflon deposit and repeated bacteriuria is a warning sign of the
recurrence of VUR; therefore, VCUG might be warranted for these patients.

The DmsD protein is necessary for the biogenesis of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)
reductase in many prokaryotes. It performs a critical chaperone function
initiated through its binding to the twin-arginine signal peptide of DmsA, the
catalytic subunit of DMSO reductase. Upon binding to DmsD, DmsA is translocated
to the periplasm via the so-called twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway.
Here we report the 1.38 A crystal structure of the protein DmsD from Salmonella
typhimurium and compare it with a close functional homolog, TorD. DmsD has an
all-alpha fold structure with a notable helical extension located at its
N-terminus with two solvent exposed hydrophobic residues. A major difference
between DmsD and TorD is that TorD structure is a domain-swapped dimer, while
DmsD exists as a monomer. Nevertheless, these two proteins have a number of
common features suggesting they function by using similar mechanisms. A possible 
signal peptide-binding site is proposed based on structural similarities.
Computational analysis was used to identify a potential GTP binding pocket on
similar surfaces of DmsD and TorD structures.

Establishment, Jhansi Road, Gwalior-474 002, India.

Arsenicosis, due to contaminated drinking water in the Indo-Bangladesh region, is
a serious health hazard in terms of morbidity and mortality. Reactive oxygen
species (ROS) generated due to arsenic toxicity have been attributed as one of
the initial signals that impart cellular toxicity, which is controlled by the
internal antioxidant glutathione (GSH). In the present study, we investigated (i)
the role of GSH and its linked enzymes, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione
reductase, in reversing chronic arsenic toxicity using a thiol chelating agent,
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), or one of its analogues individually or 
in combination; (ii) if alterations in the carbon side chain of DMSA increased
efficacy; and (iii) whether the combination therapy enhance arsenic removal from 
hepatic tissue and prevent hepatic apoptosis. Results indicated that chronic
arsenic exposure led to a ROS-mediated, mitochondrial-driven, caspase-dependent
apoptosis in hepatic cells with a significant increase in glutathione disulfide
(GSSG) levels and decreased glutathione reductase levels. Monotherapy with DMSA
and its analogues did show minimal recovery postchelation. However, the
combination of DMSA with long carbon chain analogues like monoisoamyl DMSA
(MiADMSA) or monocyclohexyl DMSA (MchDMSA) showed a better efficacy in terms of
reducing the arsenic burden as well as reversing altered biochemical variables
indicative of oxidative stress and apoptosis. We also observed that GSH and its
linked enzymes, especially glutathione reductase, play a vital role in scavenging
ROS, maintaining GSH pools, and providing clinical recoveries. On the basis of
the above observations, we recommend that combinational therapy of DMSA and its
long carbon chain analogues MiADMSA or MchDMSA would be more effective in arsenic
toxicity.

in children.

The aim of this biomedical trial was to clarify the physiological role of
procalcitonin (PCT) in renal parenchyma apoptosis and fibrosis caused by acute
childhood pyelonephritis. This prospective study enrolled 183 children. All
children were treated with bi-therapy according to the French consensus on acute 
pyelonephritis treatment dated November 16, 1990: intra-vascular administration
of ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg/day and netromicine 7 mg/kg/day during the first 48
hours, followed by specific antibiotherapy suited to antibiogram. On admission,
PCT, C-reactive protein, and phospholipase A2 were quantified in serum.
Scintigraphy monitoring with (99m)Tc-DMSA was performed on day 4 and 9 months
later, in the presence of persistent abnormalities. On day 4, 78% presented renal
parenchyma alterations and 30% renal fibrosis 9 months after admission.
Paradoxically, PCT level was significantly lower in the presence of renal
fibrosis due to cell apoptosis (4.19 vs 7.59 μgL(-1)). A significant increase in 
PCT indicated favorable progress (recovery 7.55 vs aggravation 3.34) and no
difference between recovery and improvement. This result suggests the protective 
effect of PCT against apoptosis by nitric oxide down-regulation.

Clinical differentiation of acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary tract
infection in children.

Huang DT(1), Huang FY, Tsai TC, Tsai JD, Chiu NC, Lin CC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical variables for diagnosing childhood
acute pyelonephritis (APN) when technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy is not available.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 590 children with febrile UTI
seen from January 1999 to February 2004. On the basis of DMSA scintigraphy
performed within 7 days after admission, they were divided into APN (n = 237) or 
non-APN (n = 353) groups. Gender, age, clinical presentation, absolute neutrophil
count, C-reactive protein (CRP), urinalysis, culture, and sonographic findings
were recorded from charts.
RESULTS: A CRP level of > or =66.4 mg/L, in patients with >2 days prior to
admission had a sensitivity of 71.6% and a specificity of 72.5% for APN.
Similarly, a CRP of >27.3 mg/L in patients with < or =2 days prior to admission
and a white cell count of >14,990/mm3 had sensitivities of 68.6% and 62.0% and
specificities of 66.1% and 63.0%, respectively. Combining two or more variables
did not result in better discrimination.
CONCLUSIONS: If a DMSA scan is not available, it is reasonable to treat a febrile
UTI as APN if the CRP is >66.4 mg/L in a patient with >2 days of fever or if the 
CRP is >27.3 mg/L in a patient febrile for < or =2 days.

The hypothesis was tested that oral antibiotic treatment in children with acute
pyelonephritis and scintigraphy-documented lesions is equally as efficacious as
sequential intravenous/oral therapy with respect to the incidence of renal
scarring. A randomised multi-centre trial was conducted in 365 children aged 6
months to 16 years with bacterial growth in cultures from urine collected by
catheter. The children were assigned to receive either oral ceftibuten (9 mg/kg
once daily) for 14 days or intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg once daily) for 3
days followed by oral ceftibuten for 11 days. Only patients with lesions detected
on acute-phase dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy underwent follow-up
scintigraphy. Efficacy was evaluated by the rate of renal scarring after 6 months
on follow-up scintigraphy. Of 219 children with lesions on acute-phase
scintigraphy, 152 completed the study; 80 (72 females, median age 2.2 years) were
given ceftibuten and 72 (62 females, median age 1.6 years) were given
ceftriaxone/ceftibuten. Patients in the intravenous/oral group had significantly 
higher C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations at baseline and larger lesion(s)
on acute-phase scintigraphy. Follow-up scintigraphy showed renal scarring in
21/80 children treated with ceftibuten and 33/72 with ceftriaxone/ceftibuten (p =
0.01). However, after adjustment for the confounding variables (CRP and size of
acute-phase lesion), no significant difference was observed for renal scarring
between the two groups (p = 0.2). Renal scarring correlated with the extent of
the acute-phase lesion (r = 0.60, p < 0.0001) and the grade of vesico-ureteric
reflux (r = 0.31, p = 0.03), and was more frequent in refluxing renal units (p = 
0.04). The majority of patients, i.e. 44 in the oral group and 47 in the
intravenous/oral group, were managed as out-patients. Side effects were not
observed. From this study, we can conclude that once-daily oral ceftibuten for 14
days yielded comparable results to sequential ceftriaxone/ceftibuten treatment in
children aged 6 months to 16 years with DMSA-documented acute pyelonephritis and 
it allowed out-patient management in the majority of these children.

Evaluation of reflux nephropathy, pyelonephritis and renal dysplasia.

Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA. Damien.grattan-smith@choa.org

MR urography has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the 
relationship between reflux nephropathy, pyelonephritis, vesicoureteric reflux
and renal dysplasia. MR urography utilizes multiple parameters to assess both
renal anatomy and function and provides a more complete characterization of
acquired and congenital disease. Pyelonephritis and renal scarring can be
distinguished by assessing the parenchymal contours and signal intensity.
Characteristic imaging features of renal dysplasia include small size,
subcortical cysts, disorganized architecture, decreased and patchy contrast
enhancement as well as a dysmorphic pelvicalyceal system. Because of its ability 
to subdivide and categorize this heterogeneous group of disorders, it seems
inevitable that MR urography will replace DMSA renal scintigraphy as the gold
standard for assessment of pyelonephritis and renal scarring. MR urography will
contribute to our understanding of renal dysplasia and its relationship to reflux
nephropathy.

piglets.

BACKGROUND: Congenital obstructive renal disease often requires a decision early 
in the child's life on whether or not surgery is required. Differential renal
function (DRF) calculated from the renogram provides important information for
the correct decision in this process. A recent publication cast doubt as to the
reliability of the renogram in providing DRF in the young child.
AIM: To describe the day-to-day variation and reproducibility of the two commonly
used agents for estimating DRF.
METHODS: Within 1 week, 4-week-old pigs each underwent three examinations with
both 99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-DMSA. DRF values from the 99mTc-DTPA renograms were
calculated using both the area under the curve (AUC) and the Rutland-Patlak
equation. Day-to-day variations in the results using different background
subtraction methods were analysed using the coefficient of variation for each
case and the repeatability coefficient for each type of background subtraction.
RESULTS: DRF calculated from the 99mTc-DMSA studies showed little variation, with
a coefficient of variation of 3.9% in the worst case. The repeatability
coefficient calculated from the 99mTc-DTPA studies using the AUC technique
combined with the background subtraction method giving the least variation was
14.9% while using the Rutland-Patlak technique with its best background
subtraction showed an RC of 9.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that DRF calculated from 99mTc-DMSA studies
have low variability and the results are highly reproducible in immature pigs.
The DRF calculated from 99mTc-DTPA renograms failed to show acceptable
reproducibility when analysed using either the AUC method or the Rutland-Patlak
equation.

School, University of Crete, Crete, Greece.

PURPOSE: Evaluation and comparison between pentavalent 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic
acid (99mTc(V)-DMSA) and 99mTc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime white blood cell
(99mTc-HMPAO WBC) scintigraphy in the detection and assessment of disease
activity in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 99mTc(V)-DMSA scintigraphy was performed in 23 patients
with active IBD and true positive 99mTc-HMPAO WBC scintigraphy. Images were
considered positive when an area of increased uptake was observed. To assess
severity of IBD, semi-quantitative analysis was included with reference to the
uptake in the iliac crest. Comparison with endoscopic, radiological and clinical 
data was performed.
RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy of 99mTc-HMPAO WBC and 99mTc(V)-DMSA was 91% and
84%, respectively. A significant correlation between the findings of both
radioisotopic methods and scintigraphy score was demonstrated. Endoscopic
findings were significantly correlated with scintigraphic results. Kappa
statistics showed a moderate to good agreement between the two scintigraphic
methods. Two patients (8.8%) had negative findings with 99mTc(V)-DMSA
scintigraphy (false negative results).
CONCLUSION: 99mTc(V)-DMSA compared to 99mTc-HMPAO WBC could provide a simple,
non-invasive alternative method for the assessment of disease activity, although 
it is slightly inferior to 99mTc-HMPAO WBC scintigraphy especially in the
evaluation of disease localization in IBD patients.

To examine the effects of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on
developmental toxicity resulting from exposure to lead in utero, female albino
mice were exposed to lead by drinking water contaminated with lead acetate for 4 
weeks. After the cessation of lead exposure, female mice were supplemented by
gavage with saline solution, DMSA, or DMSA and calcium as well as ascorbic acid
from the fourth day of gestation until parturition, respectively. Lead levels
(blood, liver, and bone) were measured at birth. Pups were then tested about
neural development including surface righting reflex, cliff avoidance and air
righting reflex. The markers of physical maturation, such as body weight, pinna
unfolding, incisor eruption, and eye opening were also recorded. DMSA treatment
decreased blood lead levels of pregnant mice, however, increased lead levels in
both liver and bone of fetus, and delayed the early physical and neural
development of offspring. Calcium and ascorbic acid reduced the transfer of lead 
to fetus. In conclusion, DMSA treatment during pregnancy enhances lead-induced
fetal developmental toxicity.

Generation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in skin by exposure to
ultraviolet (UV) radiation induces a number of cutaneous pathologies such as skin
cancer, photosensitization, and photoaging among others. Skin iron catalyzes UV
generation of ROS. Topical application of iron chelators reduces erythema,
epidermal and dermal hypertrophy, wrinkle formation, tumour appearance. It has
been proposed that iron chelators can be useful agents against damaging effects
of both short- and long-term UV exposure. A better understanding of the action
mechanisms of iron chelators, might be useful to developing effective anticancer 
and antiphotoaging cosmetic products. Iron chelators may lead to accumulation of 
protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a strong photosensitizer. The action of iron chelators 
in skin, related to PpIX increase has not yet been thoroughly studied. Therefore,
we have investigated the formation of PpIX in normal mouse skin after topical
application of creams containing metal chelators. The amount and distribution of 
porphyrins formed was determined by means of non-invasive fluorescence
spectroscopy. Deferoxamine (DF), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
1,2-diethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one (CP94), but not meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA), caused increased accumulation of endogenous porphyrins in the skin. 
Fluorescence excitation and emission spectroscopy confirmed that PpIX was the
main fluorescent species. The amount of PpIX accumulated in skin under the
present conditions was not large enough to produce any significant erythema after
light exposure. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of PpIX induced
by iron chelators used, against photoaging and cancer prevention.

Urinary interleukin-6 is useful in distinguishing between upper and lower urinary
tract infections.

This study was designed to determine whether the measurement of interleukin
(IL)-6 in urine is useful for distinguishing between acute pyelonephritis and
lower urinary tract infection. This observational study was carried out at León
Hospital (Spain) on 35 patients (ten boys) aged between 0 and 14 years with
urinary tract infection. Urinary levels of IL-6 were determined with
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at diagnosis and after recovery. Renal 
dimercaptosuccinate acid (DMSA) scan was performed on all patients to discard or 
confirm acute pyelonephritis. The mean urinary concentration [x +/- standard
deviation (SD)] of IL-6 at diagnosis was 20.3 +/- 23.3 and 5.3 +/- 9.7 pg/ml in
patients with acute pyelonephritis and lower urinary infection, respectively [95%
confidence interval (CI): 2.6-27.4; p < 0.01]. Specificity for a value of IL-6
>15 pg/ml, was 94.1% (95% CI: 91.1-97.1). Positive predictive value for IL-6 >15 
pg/ml was 87.5% (95% CI: 81.1-93.8). IL-6 was undetectable in the urine of both
groups of patients at the time of recovery. Urinary levels of IL-6 are useful in 
differentiating between upper and lower urinary tract infection in children. In
this clinical setting, a value >15 pg/ml is a strong indicator of acute
pyelonephritis.

The Escherichia coli TatABC system and a Bacillus subtilis TatAC-type system
recognise three distinct targeting determinants in twin-arginine signal peptides.

The Tat system transports folded proteins across bacterial and thylakoid
membranes. In Gram-negative organisms, it is encoded by tatABC genes and the
system recognizes substrates bearing signal peptides with a conserved
twin-arginine motif. Most Gram-positive organisms lack a tatB gene, indicating
major differences in organisation and/or mechanism. Here, we have characterized
the essential targeting determinants that are recognized by a Bacillus subtilis
TatAC-type system, TatAdCd. Substitution by lysine of either of the twin-arginine
residues in the TorA signal peptide can be tolerated, but the presence of
twin-lysine residues blocks export completely. We show that additional
determinants can be as important as the twin-arginine motif. Replacement of the
-1 serine by alanine, in either the TorA or DmsA signal peptide, almost blocks
export by either the B. subtilis TatAdCd or Escherichia coli TatABC systems,
firmly establishing the importance of this -1 residue in these signal peptides.
Surprisingly, the +2 leucine in the DmsA signal peptide (sequence SRRGLV) appears
to play an equally important role and substitution by alanine or phenylalanine
blocks export by both the B. subtilis and E. coli systems. These data identify
three distinct determinants, whose importance varies depending on the signal
peptide in question. The data also show that the B. subtilis TatAdCd and E. coli 
TatABC systems recognize very similar determinants within their target peptides, 
and exhibit surprisingly similar responses to mutations within these
determinants.

Normal dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy makes voiding cystourethrography
unnecessary after urinary tract infection.

Academy at Göteborg University, Göteborg, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that infants with dilating vesicoureteral
reflux (VUR) have abnormal acute dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy
results, as was suggested by an earlier retrospective study.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective study of infants <1 year old with first 
diagnosed symptomatic urinary tract infection at the Children's Hospital of
Göteborg, Sweden. Two hundred ninety consecutive children (161 boys and 129
girls) with complete records were examined. Renal ultrasound scanning and DMSA
scintigraphy were performed within a few days from diagnosis, and VCU was
performed within 2 months.
RESULTS: VUR was found in 52 children, of which 27 had dilating VUR (grade
III-V). DMSA scintigraphy results were abnormal in 149 infants (51%), 105 of 238 
(44%) without VUR, 18 of 25 (72%) with VUR grade I to II, and 26 of 27 (96%) with
VUR grade III to V (P <.001).
CONCLUSION: DMSA scintigraphy results were abnormal in all 27 infants with
dilating VUR except 1. This single false-negative finding should be compared with
140 unnecessary VCU investigations. This supports our hypothesis that DMSA
scintigraphy results are abnormal when there is dilating VUR. Thus, a normal DMSA
scan makes VCU unnecessary in the primary examination of infants with UTI.

Renal scarring is known to be associated with hypertension. The primary objective
of this study was to investigate the prevalence of renal scarring in children
referred to our clinic with hypertension. The secondary objective was to compare 
renal ultrasound (US) examination with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan 
in diagnosing renal scars in these patients. The study included 159 patients who 
underwent DMSA renal scan as well as renal US for the evaluation of hypertension 
of unknown etiology. Thirty-three (21%) patients were found to have renal scars; 
their demographic details, including mean age and gender distribution, were not
significantly different from those without renal scars. In comparison with the
DMSA renal scan, sensitivity and specificity of renal US in diagnosing renal
scars were 36% and 94%, respectively. In our study, in which the prevalence of
scarring was 21%, this gave positive predictive and negative predictive values of
63% and 85%, respectively. In conclusion, our study indicates that renal scarring
is present in 21% of otherwise healthy children who are evaluated for newly
diagnosed hypertension, and renal US is not a sensitive imaging modality to rule 
out renal scarring.

We report a 12-year-old girl with a long history of constant urinary dribbling
and apparently only a left kidney. Using a multimodality approach involving the
fusion of MR urography and (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) SPECT datasets,
it was finally possible to exactly localize the very small dystopic, dysplastic
right kidney and its ectopic ureter draining into the vagina.

BACKGROUND: To correlate the anatomical and functional information obtained using
MRI in comparison to the techniques traditionally used in the study of
uropathies, and to compare their physical and socioeconomic impacts.
METHODS: For a period of eleven months we carried out a prospective study of 22
patients of both sexes ranging in age from 1 to 180 months. All suffered from one
or another uropathy. Fifty-five percent of the patients were from external
consultation while 45% had been diagnosed prenatally. The imaging techniques
compared with MRI were as follows: echography, renogram, renal DMSA scan,
urography and cystography. For the MRI gadolinium was used, as well as general
anesthesia in some cases.
RESULTS: There was a significant correlation (r = 0.942 p < 0.01) between MRI and
the traditional explorations for the diagnosis of hydronephrosis, horseshoe
kidney, kidney duplication, kidney hypoplasia and hypertrophy, multicystic
kidney, ureterocele, pyeloureteral stenosis, vesicoureteral stenosis, atrophy of 
the renal artery, and missing kidney. It was not useful for reflux. Comparing to 
renal function differential on renogram there was an 86% agreement between the
results. The average number of visits was 5.7 and missed workdays 4.1. The cost
as a result of MRI was less than that for other explorations (Chi2 = 27,909 p <
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: MRI provides the same information, both morphological and concerning
functional quality, as well as vascular, as that obtained through traditional
explorations. Irradiation with MRI is nil. At times it requires anesthesia. Its
practice reduces costs, visits, missed workdays, and travel time. In the future
it could probably be possible to carry out cystography and hydric/diuretic
overload testing at the same time, the efficacy will be increased.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) exists in meso and racemic (rac) forms. Unlike a
meso isomer, rac-2,3-DMSA is very soluble in water, strongly acidic solutions and
organic solvents. Despite these differences, rac-2,3-DMSA has not been studied as
a radiopharmaceutical. In this study, (188)Re complexes with diastereomeric DMSA 
were prepared to compare the properties of 188Re(V)-rac-DMSA with those of
188Re(V)-meso-DMSA in in vitro and in vivo models.METHODS: rac-2,3-DMSA was
synthesized and radiolabeled with 188Re. The biodistribution and gamma camera
imaging of 188Re(V)-meso-DMSA and 188Re(V)-rac-DMSA were performed in nude mice
subcutaneously implanted with PC-12 cell lines.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Both 188Re(V)-meso-DMSA and 188Re(V)-rac-DMSA showed
excellent radiochemical purity and stability at room temperature. Compared with
188Re(V)-meso-DMSA, 188Re(V)-rac-DMSA needed a higher concentration of rac-DMSA
and metabisulfite for maximum yields. 188Re(V)-meso-DMSA showed high labeling
efficiency at pH 2, whereas 188Re(V)-rac-DMSA showed maximum yields at pH 5. The 
tumor uptake of 188Re(V)-rac-DMSA was 3.5 times higher than that of
188Re(V)-meso-DMSA at 1 h (P<.01). Gamma camera images showed that
188Re(V)-rac-DMSA was more selectively localized than 188Re(V)-meso-DMSA at the
tumor region in a xenograft model. These results demonstrate that
188Re(V)-rac-DMSA may have better potential than 188Re(V)-meso-DMSA as a
therapeutic agent against neuroendocrine tumors.

Organic and inorganic selenium speciation in environmental and biological samples
by nanometer-sized materials packed dual-column separation/preconcentration
on-line coupled with ICP-MS.

A novel, fast, and cheap nonchromatographic method for direct speciation of
dissolved inorganic and organic selenium species in environmental and biological 
samples was developed by flow injection (FI) dual-column
preconcentration/separation on-line coupled with ICP-MS determination. In the
developed technique, the first column packed with nanometer-sized Al(2)O(3) could
selectively adsorb the inorganic selenium [Se(IV), Se(VI)], and the retained
inorganic selenium could be eluted by 0.2 mol l(-1) NaOH, while the organic Se
[selenocystine (SeCys(2)) and selenomethionine (Se-Met)] was not retained. On the
other hand, the second column packed with mesoporous TiO(2) chemically modified
by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) could selectively adsorb Se(IV) and SeCys(2)
and barely adsorb Se(VI) and Se-Met. When the sample solution was passed through 
the column 1, separation of inorganic selenium and organic selenium could be
achieved first. Then, the effluent from column 1 was successively introduced into
the column 2 and the speciation of organic selenium could be attained due to the 
different adsorption behaviors of Se-Met and SeCys(2) on DMSA modified TiO(2).
After that, the eluent from column 1 contained Se(IV), and Se(VI) was adjusted to
desired pH and injected into column 2, and the speciation of Se(IV) and Se(VI)
could also be realized thanks to their different retention on column 2. The
parameters affecting the separation were investigated systematically and the
optimal separation conditions were established. The detection limits obtained for
Se(IV), Se(VI), Se-Met and SeCys(2) were 45-210 ng l(-1) with precisions of
3.6-9.7%. The proposed method has been successfully applied for the speciation of
dissolved inorganic and organic selenium in environmental and biological samples.
In order to validate the methodology, the developed method was also applied to
the speciation of selenium in certified reference material of SELM-1 yeast, and
the determined values were in good agreement with the certified values.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to analyse the postoperative
results of conservative management of functional ectopic ureter on duplicated
collecting system by low uretero-ureterostomy in children.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: The medical records of children with duplicated collecting 
system and a functional ectopic ureter admitted to our department between 2001
and 2005 were reviewed. A postnatal radiological assessment comprising urinary
tract ultrasound, retrograde cystography, intravenous urography and DMSA renal
scintigraphy was performed. In each patient, the operative technique consisted of
low uretero-ureterostomy with end-to-side uretero-ureteric anastomosis.
RESULTS: This series comprised 3 girls and 2 boys. The ectopic ureter was located
on the left side in all patients. Postnatal ultrasound confirmed the presence of 
dilatation of the upper collecting system and the retrovesical ureter estimated
at 10 +/- 2 mm in 3 cases; in one case, dilatation of the upper collecting system
was estimated at 25 mm and the retrovesical ureter was estimated at 16 +/- 2 mm; 
in the last patient, dilatation of the upper collecting system above the
retrovesical ureter was estimated at 6.5 mm. Mean renal function of the upper
pole (DMSA) was 23 +/- 7%. The mean age at the time of the operation was 8
months. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful in all patients. Mean
follow-up was 38 months (range: 18 months to 4.5 years). All children were
asymptomatic and a reduction of collecting system and ureteric dilatation was
confirmed on follow-up ultrasound at 10 months in all patients.
CONCLUSION: Low uretero-ureteric anastomosis is an alternative to high collecting
system anastomosis or ureteric reimplantation in the presence of a functional
ectopic ureter on duplicated collecting system in children.

Renal length discrepancy by ultrasound is a reliable predictor of an abnormal
DMSA scan in children.

Iran.

A renal length discrepancy (RLD) of more than 10 mm by ultrasound (US) is
accepted as a potential indicator of an underlying renal pathology; however,
there are few supporting data for this in children. Our objective was to
determine a cutoff at which RLD on US is a reliable predictor of
dimercaptosuccinate acid (DMSA) scan abnormality. We present data from 90
patients who had both renal US and a DMSA scan, as well as DMSA scan results
compared with bipolar RLD by US. Positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive
values were calculated for renal RLD from 6 to >10 mm. The left kidney was longer
in 56%, whereas the right kidney was longer in 37%; their lengths were equal in
8%. For children at all ages, a left kidney longer than the right by >or=10 mm or
a right kidney longer than the left by >or=7 mm gave a PPV for DMSA abnormality
of 79% and 100%, respectively. In children older than 4 years, if the right
kidney was longer by >or=7 mm or if the left kidney was longer by >or=10 mm, the 
PPVs for DMSA abnormality were 100% and 63%, respectively. In children younger
than 4 years, when the right kidney was longer by >or=6 mm or the left was kidney
longer by >or=10 mm, the PPV were 86% and 100%, respectively. Thus, children with
a right kidney longer than the left by even <10 mm is a reliable predictor of an 
abnormal DMSA scan.

Long-term functional and morphological effects of transcatheter arterial
embolization of traumatic renal vascular injury.

Mansoura, Egypt.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term morphological and functional outcome of
superselective transarterial embolization (TAE) for treating traumatic renal
vascular injury.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The surgical records of 124 patients with traumatic renal
vascular injury managed by TAE between 1990 and 2004 were reviewed, of whom 81
completed a long- term follow-up and were included in the final analysis.
Patients were followed using serum creatinine levels, grey-scale ultrasonography,
intravenous urography (IVU) and radioisotopic renography using
(99m)Tc-mercapto-acetyl triglycine (MAG3) and (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA).
RESULTS: Embolization resulted in the cessation of haematuria in all patients but
two (97.5%). At 3 months, serum creatinine levels increased in four of nine
patients with a solitary kidney, but only one of them required haemodialysis.
After a mean follow-up of 4.6 years, IVU showed a normal calyceal configuration
in 70% of renal units, pyelonephritic changes in 26% and no dye excretion in 4%. 
DMSA scans showed no evidence of photopenic areas in 17 renal units (21%). The
mean (sd) percentage of DMSA uptake by the corresponding kidney improved from 24 
(9)% at the 3-month scans to 32 (10)% at the last follow-up scan (P < 0.001).
Using MAG3, the mean (sd) glomerular filtration rate improved significantly from 
26 (11) mL/min at the 3-month scan to 32 (9) mL/min at the last follow-up (P <
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Superselective TAE is safe and effective for traumatic renal
vascular injury. The short-term deleterious effects were more pronounced in
patients with a solitary kidney. The long-term follow-up showed functional and
morphological improvements in the embolized renal units.

Critical prospective appraisal of renal morphology and function in children
undergoing shockwave lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

Wadhwa P(1), Aron M, Bal CS, Dhanpatty B, Gupta NP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi,
India.

PURPOSE: To assess the effect of shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) and percutaneous
nephrolithotomy (PCNL) on renal morphology and function in children undergoing
therapy for upper-tract urolithiasis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients less than 13 years of age with renal or
upper-ureteral calculi who were found suitable for primary SWL or PCNL were
evaluated for alteration of renal morphology and function after treatment. Of the
18 renal units treated, SWL and PCNL were performed in 9 units each. The average 
stone size was 880.2 mm2 (range 110-3800 mm2; median 660 mm2). All children
underwent ultrasonic estimation of renal length and parenchymal thickness, 99m
technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 99m Tc-ethylene dicystine (EDC)
scintigraphy, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation prior to
intervention and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: Extracorporeal lithotripsy achieved complete clearance in 8 renal units 
(88%), requiring an average of 6333 shockwaves and an average of 2.2 sessions per
renal unit. The efficiency quotient was 42. Percutaneous surgery likewise
achieved complete stone clearance in 88% of renal units, with three units
requiring more than one tract. Mixed calcium oxalate monohydrate and dihydrate
accounted for the majority of the stones. The mean preintervention GFR was 78.3
+/- 14.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 (median 82.5 mL/min/1.73 m2; range 54-98.6 mL/min/1.73
m2), whereas the mean GFR at 3 months was 78.95 +/- 14.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (median
78.95 mL/min/1.73 m2; range 52-98 mL/min/1.73 m2). A marginal improvement of an
average of 0.65 mL/min was noted. Split function EDC scans demonstrated improved 
drainage in five cases after intervention; the rest were unchanged.
Preintervention DMSA scans revealed renal cortical scars in three children. None 
of the renal units had developed fresh scars at follow-up scans. None of the
children developed new-onset hypertension, proteinuria, or alteration in renal
size.
CONCLUSION: In the present study, pediatric SWL and PCNL were not found to cause 
adverse renal morphologic or functional alteration. Stone clearance resulted in
marginally improved function and better drainage.

Multidrug resistance proteins and the renal elimination of inorganic mercury
mediated by 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid.

Current therapies for inorganic mercury (Hg(2+)) intoxication include
administration of a metal chelator, either 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid 
(DMPS) or meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). After exposure to either
chelator, Hg(2+) is rapidly eliminated from the kidneys and excreted in the
urine, presumably as an S-conjugate of DMPS or DMSA. The multidrug resistance
protein 2 (Mrp2) has been implicated in this process. We hypothesize that Mrp2
mediates the secretion of DMPS- or DMSA-S-conjugates of Hg(2+) from proximal
tubular cells. To test this hypothesis, the disposition of Hg(2+) was examined in
control and Mrp2-deficient TR(-) rats. Rats were injected i.v. with 0.5 mumol/kg 
HgCl(2) containing (203)Hg(2+). Twenty-four and 28 h later, rats were injected
with saline, DMPS, or DMSA. Tissues were harvested 48 h after HgCl(2) exposure.
The renal and hepatic burden of Hg(2+) in the saline-injected TR(-) rats was
greater than that of controls. In contrast, the amount of Hg(2+) excreted in
urine and feces of TR(-) rats was less than that of controls. DMPS, but not DMSA,
significantly reduced the renal and hepatic content of Hg(2+) in both groups of
rats, with the greatest reduction in controls. A significant increase in urinary 
and fecal excretion of Hg(2+), which was greater in the controls, was also
observed following DMPS treatment. Experiments utilizing inside-out membrane
vesicles expressing MRP2 support these observations by demonstrating that DMPS-
and DMSA-S-conjugates of Hg(2+) are transportable substrates of MRP2.
Collectively, these data support a role for Mrp2 in the DMPS- and DMSA-mediated
elimination of Hg(2+) from the kidney.

AIM: The preparation and stability of a new (188)Re-S(4)-complex [S(4) =
(1-aza-18-crown-6)(O)C-C(SH)-C(SH)-C(O)NH-(CH(2))(3)-NH-(CH(2))(3)-NHC(O)-C(SH)-C
(SH)-C(O)(1-aza-18-crown-6] was studied at therapeutic relevant radioactive
concentrations. The results were compared with (188)Re-MAG(3) (MAG(3):
mercaptoacetyltriglycine) and (188)Re-DMSA preparations (DMSA: dimercaptosuccinic
acid) performed with the same highly concentrated [(188)Re]perrhenate solution
(12-15 GBq/ml).
METHODS: The (188)Re complexes were prepared by direct reduction of perrhenate
((188)Re-S(4)-complex) as well as via the (188)Re-EDTA precursor complex
((188)Re-MAG(3), (188)Re-DMSA). The preparations were stabilised with 15 mg of
ascorbic acid and analysed after 1, 2, and 24 hours by TLC and HPLC.
Additionally, in vitro and in vivo stability studies were performed with the
purified complexes.
RESULTS: After stabilisation with 15 mg of ascorbic acid, all of the complexes
were nearly stable under nitrogen for hours, and only 2-8% of perrhenate was
observed after 24 h. In contrast, only the (188)Re-S(4) complex was completely
stable in vitro and in all investigated in vivo samples after separation of
ligand excess and reducing agent by HPLC.
CONCLUSION: The bridging amine group or free carboxylic groups of the S(4)-ligand
framework make available reactive positions for coupling biomolecules to the
chelate. Thus it appears that the new (188)Re-S(4) complexes offer the
possibility of stable and high specific activity labelling of biomolecules for
therapeutic application.

Arsenic induced oxidative stress and the role of antioxidant supplementation
during chelation: a review.

Arsenic is a naturally occurring metalloid, ubiquitously present in the
environment in both organic and inorganic forms. Arsenic contamination of
groundwater in the West Bengal basin in India is unfolding as one of the worst
natural geoenvironmental disaster to date. Chronic exposure of humans to high
concentration of arsenic in drinking water is associated with skin lesions,
peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, Blackfoot disease and high risk of
cancer The underlying mechanism of toxicity includes the interaction with the
sulphydryl groups and the generation of reactive oxygen species leading to
oxidative stress. Chelation therapy with chelating agents like British Anti
Lewisite (BAL), sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropane 1-sulfonate (DMPS), meso 2,3
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) etc., is considered to be the best known treatment
against arsenic poisoning. The treatment with these chelating agents however is
compromised with certain serious drawbacks/side effects. The studies show that
supplementation of antioxidants along with a chelating agent prove to be a better
treatment regimen. This review attempts to provide the readers with a
comprehensive account of recent developments in the research on arsenic poisoning
particularly the role of oxidative stress/free radicals in the toxic
manifestation, an update about the recent strategies for the treatment with
chelating agents and a possible beneficial role of antioxidants supplementation
to achieve the optimum effects.

Limited genetic diversity in Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis PT13.

Jamieson F, Gilmour MW.

BACKGROUND: Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis has emerged as a significant 
foodborne pathogen throughout the world and is commonly characterized by phage
typing. In Canada phage types (PT) 4, 8 and 13 predominate and in 2005 a large
foodborne PT13 outbreak occurred in the province of Ontario. The ability to link 
strains during this outbreak was difficult due to the apparent clonality of PT13 
isolates in Canada, as there was a single dominant pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) profile amongst epidemiologically linked human and food
isolates as well as concurrent sporadic strains. The aim of this study was to
perform comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), DNA sequence-based typing (SBT) 
genomic analyses, plasmid analyses, and automated repetitive sequence-based PCR
(rep-PCR) to identify epidemiologically significant traits capable of subtyping
S. Enteritidis PT13.
RESULTS: CGH using an oligonucleotide array based upon chromosomal coding
sequences of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 and the Salmonella
genomic island 1 successfully determined major genetic differences between S.
Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis PT13, but no significant strain-to-strain
differences were observed between S. Enteritidis PT13 isolates. Individual loci
(safA and fliC) that were identified as potentially divergent in the CGH data set
were sequenced in a panel of S. Enteritidis strains, and no differences were
detected between the PT13 strains. Additional sequence-based typing was performed
at the fimA, mdh, manB, cyaA, citT, caiC, dmsA, ratA and STM0660 loci. Similarly,
no diversity was observed amongst PT13 strains. Variation in plasmid content
between PT13 strains was observed, but macrorestriction with BglII did not
identify further differences. Automated rep-PCR patterns were variable between
serovars, but S. Enteritidis PT13 strains could not be differentiated.
CONCLUSION: None of the methods identified any significant variation between PT13
strains. Greater than 11,300 base pairs of sequence for each of seven S.
Enteritidis PT13 strains were analyzed without detecting a single polymorphic
site, although diversity between different phage types of S. Enteritidis was
observed. These data suggest that Canadian S. Enteritidis PT13 strains are highly
related genetically.

Erdosteine is a mucolytic agent having antioxidant properties through its active 
metabolites in acute injuries induced by pharmacological drugs. This study was
designed to investigate the renoprotective potential of Erdosteine against
gentamicin (GM)-induced renal dysfunction by using Technetium-99 m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99 m DMSA) uptake and scintigraphy in rats. For this 
purpose, male Wistar rats were randomly allotted into one of the four
experimental groups: Control, Erdosteine, GM, and GM + Erdosteine groups. GM and 
GM + Erdosteine groups received 100 mg/kg GM intramuscularly for 6 days. In
addition, Erdosteine and GM + Erdosteine groups received 50 mg/kg Erdosteine
orally for 6 days. Renal function tests were assessed by serum blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), creatinine levels, as well as scintigraphic and tissue
radioactivity measurements with Tc-99 m DMSA. Renal oxidative damage was
determined by renal malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, by antioxidant enzyme
activities; superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and activities of
oxidant enzymes; xanthine oxidase (XO) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). GM
administration resulted in marked renal lipid peroxidation, increased XO and MPO 
activities and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities. GM + Erdosteine group
significantly had lower MDA levels, higher SOD and CAT activities and lower XO
and MPO activities, when compared to GM. Also GM + Erdosteine had lower levels of
serum BUN, creatinine and higher renal tissue Tc-99 m DMSA uptake and
radioactivity with respect to GM. In conclusion, our results supported a
protective role of Erdosteine in nephrotoxicity associated with GM treatment.

Risk factors for renal scarring in children with lower urinary tract dysfunction 
(LUTD) were evaluated. The medical records of 120 patients were assessed
concerning gender, presence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), bladder capacity,
detrusor overactivity, residual urine, febrile urinary tract infection (UTI),
bacteriuria, constipation, detrusor sphincter incoordination (DSI), high detrusor
pressure at maximal cystometric capacity (PMCC), low compliance, and thickness
and trabeculation of the bladder wall. Renal scarring was diagnosed by
(99m)technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan (DMSA). Renal scarring was
detected in 38 patients (31%). VUR, UTI, decreased bladder capacity, urinary
residue, and trabeculated and thick bladder wall were associated with scarring at
univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed VUR (P < 0.0001) as the
independent risk factor for renal scarring. Thickness of the bladder wall was a
marginal risk factor (P = 0.07). Although UTI was not a risk factor, it was
associated with VUR (P = 0.03). In our analysis, VUR was the main risk factor;
however, renal scarring was probably due to multifactorial causes, as VUR was
associated with UTI.

The present study was planned to investigate if combined administration of
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA) could
achieve better recovery in the altered biochemical parameters suggestive of brain
oxidative stress and depletion of lead from blood and brain following acute lead 
exposure. Male Wistar rats were exposed to lead nitrate (50 mg/kg, i.p., once
daily for 5 days) followed by treatment with the above chelating agents using two
different doses of 25 or 50 mg/kg (orally) either alone and in combination once
daily for five consecutive days. Lead exposure resulted in the significant
inhibition of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity and depletion of
glutathione (GSH) in blood. These changes were accompanied by significant
reduction in blood hemoglobin, RBC levels and superoxide dismutase and catalase
activities. Significant increase in blood reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels were noted. We observed
marked increase in brain ROS level while GSH/oxidized glutathione ratio showed
significant decrease accompanied by a significant increase in blood and brain
lead concentration. The levels of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin in
different brain regions were also altered on lead exposure. Co-administration of 
DMSA and MiADMSA particularly at the lower dose was most effective in the
recovery of lead-induced changes in the hematological variables and oxidative
stress and resulted in more pronounced depletion of lead from blood and brain
compared to monotherapy with these chelators. On the other hand, combined
administration of MiADMSA (50 mg/kg) in combination with DMSA (25 mg/kg each) had
additional beneficial effect over the individual effect of chelating agent in the
recovery of altered levels of brain biogenic amines. The study suggests that
administration of MiADMSA is generally a better lead chelator than DMSA while
combined administration of DMSA and MiADMSA might be a better treatment option
compared to monotherapy at least in the removal of lead from the target tissues.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Prevention of renal scarring is the main therapeutic goal in
children with spina bifida. We aimed to determine factors affecting renal scar
development in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of 312 children admitted between 1994 and 2005
with spina bifida were reviewed. Age on admission, gender, presence of previous
febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs), vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and initial
urodynamic findings were noted. Patients were grouped regarding presence/absence 
of renal scars on DMSA scans. Chi2 and Student's t tests were used for
statistical evaluation.
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients had renal scars on admission. Mean age was 4.62 +/-
4.59 years for patients without renal scars and 6.35 +/- 4.9 years for patients
with scars. Male/female ratio was 1:1 in the scarless group and 1:2 in the group 
with scars. Previous febrile UTI was present in 11 of 240 scarless patients in
contrast to 7 out of 72 patients in the scar group (p > 0.05). VUR was present in
only 16.3% of cases without scars, whereas 36.1% of patients in the scar group
had VUR. Detrusor overactivity and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia were observed
in 67.1% of scarred patients, whereas this figure was 42.4% in the scarless
group. The comparison of age on admission, gender, detrusor overactivity, and
detrusor sphincter dyssynergia revealed significant differences between patients 
with and without renal scars.
CONCLUSIONS: Late referral, female gender, overactive detrusor, and detrusor
sphincter dyssynergia have detrimental effects on renal parenchymal function in
spina bifida patients. Patient selection for aggressive treatment using these
features may prevent renal parenchymal deterioration.

Turkey.

AIM: We aimed to investigate in children with a history of acute pyelonephritis
the influence of unilateral post-pyelonephritic renal scarring detected by DMSA
scan on serum (S(CysC)) and urine cystatin C (U(CysC)) as well as upon other
traditional markers of renal damage.
METHODS: Children with DMSA proven pyelonephritis (n = 28) were grouped as either
scar [+] (n = 19, unilateral renal scarring) or scar [-] (no scarring, n = 9).
The scar [+] group was further divided into scar-1 (differential DMSA uptake,
Delta(DMSA) </= 10%; n = 8) and scar-2 (Delta(DMSA) > 10%, n = 11) subgroups.
S(CysC), serum creatinine, urine NAG, microalbumin, protein, fractional sodium
excretion (FE(Na)), tubular phosphate reabsorption (TPR), and U(CysC/Cr) were
evaluated in all patients.
RESULTS: Neither S(CysC) nor U(CysC) were affected by age, height, and weight.
scar [+] versus scar [-] groups and scar-1 versus scar-2 subgroups were not
different with regard to all studied parameters. S(CysC) did not increase in
children with post-pyelonephritic unilateral renal scarring. However, 11 children
with slightly increased (>0.95 mg/l) S(CysC) levels in scar [+] group tended to
have higher Delta(DMSA), albeit not significantly. Furthermore, U(CysC/Cr)
correlated well with urine microalbumin, NAG, and FE(Na) in all children and the 
scar [+] group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: S(CysC) and U(CysC) did not differ among pediatric patients with and 
without unilateral post-pyelonephritic renal scarring. However, Delta(DMSA)
uptake between the two kidneys tended to be raised in children with S(CysC)
levels higher than the reference ranges. Additionally, U(CysC/Cr) exhibits
parallelism with tubular functions.

AIM: Acute pyelonephritis is a common infectious disease in children and can
result in permanent renal damage. Interleukin (IL)-1beta is an important
inflammatory mediator that appears early during bacterial infection. This
prospective study examined urine IL-1beta levels in children with acute
pyelonephritis documented by (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, and
also evaluated whether this cytokine correlated with renal scarring.
METHODS: A total of 75 children aged 1-121 months with a diagnosis of first-time 
febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) were studied. The following inflammatory
markers were assessed: fever, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, C-reactive
protein (CRP) and urine IL-1beta. Urine samples were collected for IL-1beta
measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after antibiotic
treatment of the infection. Follow-up DMSA scan was performed at 6-12 months
after the acute pyelonephritis to detect renal scarring. Twenty children with
other febrile illnesses served as non-renal febrile controls.
RESULTS: The 75 children were divided into acute pyelonephritis (n = 41) and
lower UTI (n = 34) groups according to the findings of DMSA scans. Fever, WBC
count, neutrophil count and CRP were significantly higher in the children with
acute pyelonephritis than in those with lower UTI (all P < 0.001). The initial
urine IL-1beta levels of children with acute pyelonephritis were significantly
higher when compared with lower UTI and non-renal febrile controls (P < 0.001).
Urine IL-1beta in children with acute pyelonephritis was positively correlated
with fever, CRP, WBC, neutrophil and leucocyturia. Renal scarring was found in 12
(29.3%) of the 41 children with acute pyelonephritis. The mean age was
significantly lower in the children with renal scarring compared with those
without (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: These results have shown that urine IL-1beta level may serve as a
useful marker for the early detection of acute pyelonephritis in febrile
children. Young children are at a risk of the development of renal scarring
following acute pyelonephritis.

University of Nis, Serbia. mrajic@EUnet.yu

AIM: The aim of this study was to assess renal function in different stages of
type 1 diabetes mellitus by radionuclide methods. Additionally, glomerular and
tubular functions were correlated with urinary albumin (UAER) and
N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGA) excretion rates.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients with diabetes mellitus were classified
into four groups: normoalbuminuric (NA, 18 patients), microalbuminuric (MiA, 12
patients), macroalbuminuric (MaA, 13 patients), and chronic renal failure group
(CRF, 10 patients). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by
diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-technetium 99m ((99m)Tc-DTPA) clearance rate 
while tubular function was calculated as a percentage of net injected activity
fixed in both kidneys, 4 h after intravenous injection of dimercaptosuccinate
acid-technetium 99m ((99m)Tc-DMSA). Additionally, (99m)Tc-DTPA clearance was
correlated with estimated GFR (eGFR) by using modified Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease (MDRD) Study Group formula.
RESULTS: (99m)Tc-DTPA clearance and (99m)Tc-DMSA fixation were found
significantly higher in normoalbuminuric group (p < 0.05 and p < 0.02,
respectively), unchanged in microalbuminuric group (p > 0.05, p > 0.05), and
decreased in both macroalbuminuric (p < 0.0001, p < 0.00001) and chronic renal
failure group (p < 0.0001, p < 0.00001). Renal function was denoted as normal,
increased (hyperfunction), or decreased (hypofunction). It was found normal in a 
high percentage of patients with normalbuminuria (filtration 44.4%, fixation
72.2% pts) and microalbuminuria (66.7% and 66.7%). Renal hyperfunction was not
only found frequent in normalbuminuric group (55.6% and 27.8%), but was also
recorded in microalbuminuric group (8.3% and 8.3%). Renal hypofunction was
present in all macroalbuminuric patients and in one-quarter of those with
microalbuminuria as well. Such distribution of renal function conditions
indicated normalbuminuric and microalbuminiric groups functionally heterogeneous.
Regression analysis showed a significant correlation between (99m)Tc-DTPA
clearance and eGFR in MaA and CRF groups only. Although urinary NAGA excretion
rate was shown as a less sensitive staging parameter, being significantly
increased when compared to control group only in MaA and CRF groups (p < 0.05),
it significantly correlated with (99m)Tc-DTPA clearance rate (r = -0.485, p =
0.0004) and (99m)Tc-DMSA tubular fixation (r = -0.526, p = 0.0002).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study favor the performance of radionuclide
studies together with the determination of urinary albumin excretion rate in
patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in order to achieve more reliable staging 
of diabetic kidney disease. The demonstration of glomerular hyperfiltration and
tubular hyperfunction by radiopharmaceuticals contributes to the early detection 
of diabetic kidney disease, while the quantification of renal function enables
the follow-up of the progressive function loss in the later course of the
disease.

OBJECTIVES: Experimental data suggest a role for calcitonin gene-related peptide 
(CGRP) in normal breast development and angiogenesis. This pilot study correlated
CGRP with neoangiogenesis and the uptake of the tumor-seeking,
proliferation-imaging radiotracer pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinate 
(99mTc-(V)DMSA) in invasive and preinvesive breast lesions.
METHODS: Among women evaluated preoperatively by 99mTc-(V)DMSA scintimammography,
29 invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) were retrospectively studied: 15 isolated
(Group I); 14 mixed with preinvasive pathologies (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]
and/or epithelial hyperplasia [EH]; Group M). CGRP staining and neoangiogenesis
were compared between invasive and DCIS/EH regions and were correlated.
99mTc-(V)DMSA displayed a diffusely increased uptake pattern corresponding to
DCIS/EH; its lesion-to-background (L/B) ratio was compared between images
acquired at 10 and 60 minutes and its retention ratio (RR) was correlated with
CGRP.
RESULTS: Seven of 15 group I and 10 of 14 group M patients (58.6% of the
population) were CGRP-positive. CGRP was prevalent in the DCIS/EH component of
mixed-lesions (even in the surrounding normal epithelium of nearly half), with
declining intensity as advancing from DCIS/EH to high-grade IDC. Similarly,
neoangiogenesis was considerably higher in DCIS/EH than in group I pure IDCs. A
significant CGRP-neoangiogenesis correlation was verified only in group I. The
diffuse 99mTc-(V)DMSA uptake exhibited significant, time-related L/B increase and
a RR positively correlating with CGRP.
CONCLUSIONS: CGRP expression and neoangiogenesis are intensified in mixed
invasive-preinvasive breast lesions; an underlying relation may exist, requiring 
further investigation. CGRP also appears associated with 99mTc-(V)DMSA's
propensity to depict preinvasive pathologies. This relationship could denote an
additional proliferative role for CGRP.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of
99mTc(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc(V)-DMSA) scintigraphy for the assessment 
of disease activity in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) and compare
their clinical parameters.
METHODS: The study involved 20 patients who were clinically inactive and eight
patients who were clinically active, a total 28 GO patients (18 female, 10 male; 
mean age: 39.2+/-13.4 years) and 12 control subjects (six female, six male; mean 
age: 57.12+/-12 years). Planar and SPECT orbital images were obtained 4 h after
the intravenous injection of 555-740 MBq 99mTc(V)-DMSA, using low-energy,
high-resolution, parallel-hole collimators with dual-head detectors. All SPECT
data were reconstructed on conventional axial, sagittal and coronal projections
using an iterative reconstruction. Semi-quantitative evaluation was performed
comparing the orbital activity with nasal activity based on four grades. GO was
classified according to the NOSPECS classification of the American Thyroid
Association. Disease was considered clinically active if symptoms and signs
deteriorated over 3 months.
RESULTS: No significant correlation was detected between clinical activity and
classification (P=0.192). However, clinical activity and 99mTc(V)-DMSA uptake
were significantly correlated (P=0.0001). There was no correlation between the
clinical classification and scintigraphic grading. Bilateral orbital index of the
active group was significantly higher than that of the inactive group (P=0.0001).
CONCLUSION: 99mTc(V)-DMSA imaging discriminates the active from inactive GO as
well as showing an ongoing subclinical inflammation in the orbits of the patients
with GO, regardless of the disease activity clinically. Our results revealed that
99mTc(V)-DMSA is a promising agent for the diagnosis of active Graves'
ophthalmopathy.

The objective of this study was to explore the optimum combination of
micronutrients used with 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in the treatment of
moderately lead-intoxicated mice. Experiment was carried out based on the
orthogonal design L(8)(2(7)) setting six factors with two different levels of
each, and eight groups of mice were needed. Mice were exposed to lead by drinking
water contaminated with 0.1% lead acetate for four consecutive weeks, and then
supplemented by gavage with different combinations of micronutrients with and
without DMSA as designed in the orthogonal table. Lead levels in blood, liver,
kidney, brain and bone and activities of blood delta-aminolevulinic acid
dehydratase (ALAD) were analyzed after cessation of supplementation. The results 
suggested that DMSA was the only factor which could decrease significantly lead
levels in blood, liver, kidney and bone; calcium and ascorbic acid were the
notable factors decreasing lead levels in blood, liver, kidney, bone and brain;
zinc and calcium were the notable factors reversing the lead-inhibited activities
of blood ALAD; taurine was the notable factor decreasing lead levels in kidney
and brain; and thiamine was the notable factor decreasing lead levels in brain.
The lowest lead level in blood, liver, kidney and bone was shown in the mice
supplemented with combination of calcium and ascorbic acid along with DMSA. In
conclusion, the optimum combination of micronutrients used with DMSA suggested in
present study was calcium and ascorbic acid, which seemed to potentiate the
chelating efficacy of DMSA in the treatment of moderately lead intoxicated mice.

Surface immobilization of chondroitin 6-sulfate/heparin multilayer on stainless
steel for developing drug-eluting coronary stents.

Huang LY(1), Yang MC.

Author information:

Technology, Taipei 10607, Taiwan, ROC.

A thin layer of gold was sputtered onto SUS316L stainless steel (SS) sheet. After
thiolizing the Au layer with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), layers of
chondroitin 6-sulfate (ChS) and heparin (HEP) were alternatively immobilized on
the Au-treated SS. The resulting stent would be both anti-atherogenic and
anti-thrombogenic. After repeating one to five cycles, one to five layers of
polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) of ChS/HEP were successfully fabricated. A model
drug, sirolimus, was loaded in the ChS/HEP layers. The SS-ChS-HEP surface was
examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle, and atomic
force microscopy (AFM) measurement. Biological tests including hemocompatibility,
drug release pattern, and the inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation were
also performed. The results show that the multilayer of ChS/HEP exhibits longer
blood clotting time than pure SS substrates. Therefore, this biopolymer
multilayer can avoid thrombosis on the stainless. The releasing rate of sirolimus
can be controlled through the number of ChS/HEP PEC layers. With a five-layer
coating, sirolimus can be released continuously for more than 20 days.
Furthermore, the multilayer ChS/HEP loaded with sirolimus can suppress
specifically to the growth of smooth muscle cells to avoid restenosis. This
suggests that the PEC multilayer of ChS/HEP modified-SS could be applied in
making drug-eluting stents.

We report the case of an 81-year-old woman in whom clinical signs and features of
electromyographic activity patterns were consistent with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS). Increased blood level and massive urinary excretion of mercury
proved mercury intoxication. Despite a chelation treatment with Meso 2-3
dimercaptosuccininc acid (DMSA), she died after 17 months. The pathophysiology of
sporadic ALS remains unclear. However, the role of environmental factors has been
suggested. Among some environmental factors, exposure to heavy metals has been
considered and ALS cases consecutive to occupational intoxication and accidental 
injection of mercury have been reported. Although no autopsy was performed, we
discuss the role of mercury intoxication in the occurrence of ALS in our case,
considering the results of experimental studies on the toxicity of mercury for
motor neuron.

We have shown that superparamagnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles with a
surface functionalization of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) are an effective
sorbent material for toxic soft metals such as Hg, Ag, Pb, Cd, and Tl, which
effectively bind to the DMSA ligands and for As, which binds to the iron oxide
lattices. The nanoparticles are highly dispersible and stable in solutions, have 
a large surface area (114 m2/g), and have a high functional group content (1.8
mmol thiols/g). They are attracted to a magnetic field and can be separated from 
solution within a minute with a 1.2 T magnet. The chemical affinity, capacity,
kinetics, and stability of the magnetic nanoparticles were compared to those of
conventional resin based sorbents (GT-73), activated carbon, and nanoporous
silica (SAMMS) of similar surface chemistries in river water, groundwater,
seawater, and human blood and plasma. DMSA-Fe3O4 had a capacity of 227 mg of
Hg/g, a 30-fold larger value than GT-73. The nanoparticles removed 99 wt% of 1
mg/L Pb within a minute, while it took over 10 and 120 min for Chelex-100 and
GT-73 to remove 96% of Pb.

(1)Department of Urology, Clinics Hospital of the University of São Paulo, São
Paulo, Brazil. fabio.vicentini@sbu.org.br

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ureteral quadruplication is an extremely unusual
developmental abnormality. We present the eighth reported case but the first to
be associated with a ureteral cyst, with massive vesicoureteral reflux that was
treated with laparoscopic nephroureterectomy.
CASE REPORT: A 3-year-old boy was evaluated for recurrent urinary-tract
infection. Massive left-sided vesicoureteral reflux associated with incomplete
ureteral triplication was identified. A DMSA scan disclosed impaired function of 
this kidney. An uneventful total laparoscopic nephroureterectomy was performed at
which a fourth atresic ureter was identified. All the four proximal ureters
opened into a large ureteral cyst, and a distal monoureter opened into the
bladder.
CONCLUSION: The patient recovered fully and was asymptomatic 6 months
postoperatively.

Late recurrent urinary tract infections may produce renal allograft scarring even
in the absence of symptoms or vesicoureteric reflux.

United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: The significance of late urinary tract infections (UTIs) after renal 
transplantation and their association with scarring and graft dysfunction remains
controversial. We sought to define the prevalence of renal scarring in allograft 
recipients with a history of late recurrent UTIs, to determine whether the
presence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) confers an increased risk of scarring and
to establish whether scarring correlates with graft dysfunction.
METHODS: Among 307 renal allograft recipients, we identified 56 (18%) with late
recurrent UTIs (> or =3/year). A total of 32 patients had undergone further
investigation by both 2,3 dimercapto-succinic acid single-photon emission
computed tomography (99mTc-DMSA SPECT) scan and micturating cystourethrogram
(MCUG).
RESULTS: Of the 32 patients, 24 (75%) had scars on 99mTc-DMSA SPECT and 15 (47%) 
had reflux on MCUG. Thirteen of these 15 patients with reflux (87%) had scars,
although there was no significant correlation between number of scars and degree 
of reflux. Eleven of 17 patients (65%) with UTIs but without VUR had scars, as
did 12 of 14 (86%) with previous graft pyelonephritis. The pattern of scarring
(typically multiple focal cortical defects) suggested infection as the cause.
This pattern was not seen in a contemporary cohort with vascular occlusions and
was rarely seen in patients with chronic allograft nephropathy. Scarring was not 
associated with inferior graft survival (median follow-up, 15 years).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with late UTIs, renal scarring is a frequent finding.
Scarring may occur even in asymptomatic patients without VUR. The lack of an
effect on graft survival may reflect successful intervention with prophylactic
antibiotics and surveillance urine cultures. Late recurrent UTIs may be damaging 
to renal allografts, even in the absence of reflux.

BACKGROUND: Most primary non-refluxing megaureters resolve spontaneously and the 
indications for surgery are not sufficiently well established.
OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical features, treatment and outcome of
asymptomatic primary non-refluxing megaureter.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 58 infants with primary
non-refluxing megaureter. The diagnostic methods used were renal ultrasound,
renal isotopic renogram, DMSA scan, and evaluation of renal function.
RESULTS: The mean age at postnatal diagnosis was 24 days. The mean follow-up was 
4 years. Sixty-nine percent of the patients were male. Fifty-seven percent were
left megaureters and 22% were bilateral (71 affected renal units). Eleven percent
of megaureters were grade I, 48% were grade II, and 41% were grade III. Only nine
patients (15%) received surgical treatment. The indications for surgical
treatment were severe megaureter (3/9 patients; 33%), prolonged T1/2 (3/9
patients; 33%), reduced function (1/9 patients; 11%), prolonged T1/2 plus reduced
function (1/9 patients; 11%) and increased dilation (1/9 patients; 11%). The mean
age at surgery was 7 months. Outcomes in the non-surgical group (85% of the
patients; 60 renal units) were as follows: 90% of megaureters were corrected or
improved on ultrasound scan and 10% showed no change. In the first renogram,
function was low in 4/60 kidneys (7%) and T1/2 was prolonged in 3/60 (5%).
Finally, all kidneys in the non-surgical group had normal function, except one,
which was injured from the beginning. T1/2 was normal in all kidneys. Outcomes in
the surgical group (10 megaureters) were as follows: 80% of megaureters were
corrected or improved after surgical intervention and 20% showed no change. At
diagnosis, 4/10 kidneys (40%) had reduced function. In the post-surgical renogram
2/10 kidneys (20%) continued to show reduced function, 1/10 kidney (10%) showed
restored renal function, and 1/10 kidney (10%) was nephrectomized. Initial T1/2
was prolonged in 4/10 patients (40%), and after surgery T1/2 was normal in all
patients. The final DMSA scan showed 5/71 kidneys (7%) with irreversible damage
(one slightly injured, two moderately injured, and three severely injured). The
remaining 66 kidneys were normal. Overall renal function and blood pressure were 
normal in all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary non-refluxing megaureter is usually a functional and benign 
congenital malformation that resolves during the first months of life. Although
the malformation can persist, only a few patients require surgical treatment.
Most authors agree that initial treatment should not be surgical and that surgery
should be reserved for patients who develop ureteral dilation, a decrease in
differential renal function, and/or severe symptoms during follow-up. In a few
patients (7% of our series), the renal unit belonging to the megaureter shows
irreversible congenital injury. In these patients, surgery is not useful.

99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy is generally accepted as the method of choice for
detecting renal parenchymal damage in pyelonephritis. 99mTc-MAG3 dynamic
scintigraphy is not routinely used for this purpose. The AIM of this study was to
evaluate the MAG3 scintigraphic presentation in the acute phase of pyelonephritis
in children and re-evaluate them at least 6 months later, as well as to establish
whether a MAG3 in the parenchymal phase is as reliable and sensitive in the
detection of a renal parenchymal damage as the DMSA.PATIENTS, METHODS: The MAG3
scintigraphic pattern was evaluated during the first episode of acute
pyelonephritis in 31 children (median age: 2.5 years) and compared to the DMSA
scan. The scintigraphy was performed on the same day with both
radiopharmaceuticals. After at least 6 months the whole procedure was repeated on
28 patients. A scoring system was designed to evaluate the parenchymal lesions,
and categorize them as positive or equivocal. The findings on the initial scans
were compared to those obtained in the follow up studies.
RESULTS: When all lesions (equivocal + positive) were analysed, MAG3 sensitivity 
was 98%, and specificity 78%, while for positive lesions only, the values were 83
and 100%, respectively. The average acute severity score was significantly lower 
for both MAG3 and DMSA then the follow up score (p < 0.0001). These results
corresponded to a clinical convalescence, which was observed in 26/28 children in
the follow up.
CONCLUSION: With the MAG3 scintigraphy a reliable semi quantitative and
qualitative detection of the renal inflammatory lesions can be obtained in acute 
pyelonephritis, as well as their recovery, thus obviating the need for a DMSA
scan. Moreover, the duration of the MAG3 procedure is shorter, enabling the
visualization of the entire collecting system as well, while the radiation
exposure is approximately a half of that delivered by the DMSA scan.

The objective of this study was to assess clinical characteristics and results of
radio imaging studies and compare community-acquired urinary tract infection
(UTI) with nosocomial UTI in 301 neonates with UTI consecutively admitted to 28
neonatal units in Spain over 3 years (community-acquired UTI, n = 250; nosocomial
UTI, n = 51). UTI was diagnosed in the presence of symptoms of infection together
with any colony growth for a single pathogen from urine obtained by suprapubic
aspiration, or >or=10(4) CFU/ml for a single pathogen from urine obtained by
urethral catheterization. Abnormal renal ultrasound was present in 37.1% of cases
(34% in community-acquired UTI and 54.5% in nosocomial UTI, P < 0.01). The
voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) showed vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in 27% of
cases (23.8% in community-acquired UTI and 48.6% in nosocomial UTI, P < 0.01). In
patients with abnormal renal ultrasound and VUR, renal scan with
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) performed early after UTI revealed cortical
defects in 69.5% of cases. However, in patients with abnormal renal ultrasound
and normal VCUG, DMSA also revealed cortical defects in 39% of cases. The absence
of VUR in neonates with UTI and abnormal renal ultrasound does not exclude the
presence of cortical defects suggestive of pyelonephritis.

OBJECTIVE: Gallium-67 (Ga-67) and labeled leukocytes are useful in the detection 
of an unknown infectious source. However, the delay in the diagnosis of a Ga-67
citrate scan (gallium scan) and the complicated labeling technique of a leukocyte
scan are major drawbacks to their clinical use. Recently, Tc-99m (V)
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been found to be very useful in the detection 
of infection. Tc-99m (V) DMSA is inexpensive, easy to prepare, and provides a
result within hours. In this study, we evaluated the potential of Tc-99m (V) DMSA
scan (DMSA scan) in the detection of intra-abdominal infection.
METHODS: A total of 33 patients who suffered from an unknown cause of fever after
colorectal surgery were enrolled in this study. All patients received both a
gallium scan and a DMSA scan. DMSA scintigraphy was performed 3-4 h after an
injection of 740 MBq (20 mCi) of Tc-99m DMSA. After completion of the DMSA image,
111 MBq (3 mCi) of Ga-67 citrate was injected intravenously. Gallium scintigraphy
was performed after 24 h and later as needed.
RESULTS: Of the 33 patients, 17 (51.5%) were diagnosed with intra-abdominal
abscesses. For DMSA scans, the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy
were 88.2%, 93.7%, and 90.9%, respectively. For gallium scans, the diagnostic
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 100%, 87.5%, and 93.9%, respectively.
No statistical difference was found in the diagnostic accuracy between these two 
diagnostic modalities using Fisher's exact test.
CONCLUSIONS: DMSA scan is a useful alternative to gallium scan in the detection
of intra-abdominal infection in patients with colorectal surgery because Tc-99m
DMSA is inexpensive, easy to prepare, and most importantly the result can be
obtained within hours.

The role of Tc-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy in the diagnosis and follow-up of lung
cancer lesions.

OBJECTIVE: To define the role of Tc-99m (V) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scanning in the detection of lung cancer (LC) and its metastases, and monitoring 
the response of LC lesions (LCL) to chemo/radiotherapy (TH).
METHODS: Tc-99m (V) DMSA whole-body scans, planar thorax views, and thorax
Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were obtained both 30
min (early) and 5 h (late) after Tc-99m (V) DMSA administration in 12
small/nonsmall cell LC patients (11 men, 1 woman; mean age 59 years). Five
patients also had bone scans. The same scintigraphic protocol was performed in 7 
of 12 patients, 3 weeks after first-line TH. TH response was evaluated visually
in all LCL and semiquantitatively in primary tumors (PT) of six patients, by
comparing the tumor uptake ratios (TUR) of pre-TH and post-TH Tc-99m (V) DMSA
SPECT [TUR = mean counts of region of interests (ROI) in PT/mean counts in
contralateral ROI]. In seven patients, a 6-month survival was determined.
RESULTS: Tc-99m (V) DMSA accumulated in 34 LCL (11 PT, 19 bone metastases, 1
suprarenal mass, 1 axillary node, 2 supraclavicular nodes). A total of 11
patients displayed Tc-99m (V) DMSA uptake in LCL and one patient did not show
uptake. In six patients, SPECT imaging showed deeply located PT in the lung
parenchyma better than planar views. In five patients, both planar and SPECT
views revealed peripherally located PT in the lungs. Early scans showed 18 LCL
and late scans displayed all the LCL. Nine bone metastases on pre-TH Tc-99m (V)
DMSA scans revealed matched areas of increased Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate
(MDP) uptake on bone scans; six bone metastases were additionally detected on
Tc-99m (V) DMSA scans when compared with bone scans, and four bone metastases on 
Tc-99m (V) DMSA scans could not be compared with bone scans because bone scan was
not performed. In one patient, Tc-99m (V) DMSA scans became positive for bone
metastases on post-TH later than the bone scans for some of the bone metastases. 
Neither planar nor SPECT imaging showed mediastinal lesions defined on thorax CT 
in nine patients. On TH monitoring, 17 LCL showed diminished Tc-99m (V) DMSA
uptake, one disappeared, four were unchanged, three displayed increased uptake,
and five new lesions were established. Of the six patients, TUR in PT increased
in two (one survived), decreased in one (exitus), was unchanged in two (two
exitus) on post-TH scans, and PT totally disappeared in one (survived) patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Tc-99m (V) DMSA scans are useful in detecting LCL, except for those 
around the blood pool regions, making it a promising modality to monitor TH
response. Obtaining a single fifth hour late Tc-99m (V) DMSA scan is appropriate.
SPECT should be applied to all patients for the detection of deeply located
lesions.

In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), the dose-limiting organ is, most
often, the kidney. However, the precise mechanism as well as the exact
localization of kidney damage during PRRT have not been fully elucidated. We
studied renal damage in rats after therapy with different amounts of
[(177)Lu-DOTA(0), Tyr(3)]octreotate and investigated (99m)Tc-DMSA
(dimercaptosuccinic acid) as a tool to quantify renal damage after
PRRT.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-nine (29) rats were divided into 3 groups and
injected with either 0, 278, or 555 MBq [(177)Lu-DOTA(0), Tyr(3) ]octreotate,
leading to approximately 0, 46, and 92 Gy to the renal cortex. More than 100 days
after therapy, kidney damage was investigated using (99m)Tc-DMSA single-photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT) autoradiography, histology, and blood
analyses.
RESULTS: In vivo SPECT with (99m)Tc-DMSA resulted in high-resolution (<1.6-mm)
images. The (99m)Tc-DMSA uptake in the rat kidneys was inversely related with the
earlier injected activity of [(177)Lu-DOTA(0), Tyr(3)]octreotate and correlated
inversely with serum creatinine values. Renal ex vivo autoradiograms showed a
dose-dependent distribution pattern of (99m)Tc-DMSA. (99m)Tc-DMSA SPECT could
distinguish between the rats that were injected with 278 or 555 MBq
[(177)Lu-DOTA(0), Tyr(3) ]octreotate, whereas histologic damage grading of the
kidneys was nearly identical for these 2 groups. Histologic analyses indicated
that lower amounts of injected radioactivity caused damage mainly in the proximal
tubules, whereas as well the distal tubules were damaged after high-dose
radioactivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Renal damage in rats after PRRT appeared to start in a
dose-dependent manner in the proximal tubules and continued to the more distal
tubules with increasing amounts of injected activity. In vivo SPECT measurement
of (99m)Tc-DMSA uptake was highly accurate to grade renal tubular damage after
PRRT.

urinary tract infection.

Comment in
    Acta Paediatr Taiwan. 2007 Mar-Apr;48(2):51.

BACKGROUND: Routine imaging studies following first urinary tract infection(UTI) 
in infancy are clinically used to identify who has vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)
and acute pyelonephritis or renal scars. The potential value of these images in
avoiding children acquiring renal complication and whether the children benefited
from these examinations were not well justified.
METHODS: Analysis was undertaken of 114 infants (228 renal units) at the time of 
first documented UTI. All underwent renal ultrasound, voiding cystourethrography 
(VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan on admission and repeated
follow-up VCUG, DMSA or both after 4-6 months if initial examinations showed
abnormal at first time. The VUR on VCUG when UTI and its statistical correlations
with both acute and follow-up DMSA renal scan revealing renal scar were
calculated.
RESULTS: Seventeen children (14.9%) had VUR detected by VCUG. Forty-six patients 
(40.4%) had abnormal findings on acute DMSA renal scans (acute pyelonephritis or 
renal scars). The sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction rate and negative
prediction rates of DMSA for VUR were 63%, 82.6%, 32.7% and 94.3%, respectively. 
The initial identified VUR versus renal scarring on follow-up DMSA showed little 
correlation.
CONCLUSIONS: There is limited effectiveness of routine investigation by VCUG in
infants with first confirmed UTI. VCUG may be withheld in a child who presents
with first UTI before the age of one year if there has been no demonstrable
abnormal DMSA scan.

Risk factors for renal injury in patients with meningomyelocele.

Arora G(1), Narasimhan KL, Saxena AK, Kaur B, Mittal BR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Surgery, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education 
and Research, Chandigarh, India.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty operated patients of myelodysplasia were clinically 
evaluated for the age at presentation, the extent of lesion and neurological
deficit. Urological assessment was done with urine cultures, serum creatinine,
radiological (ultrasound of kidney, ureters and bladder, voiding
cystourethrogram) and urodynamic (water cystometry) parameters. An objective
scoring for bladder (Galloway, et al.) was applied. Dimercapto-succinic acid
(DMSA) scan was done in all the patients for evidence of renal scars. The results
of above investigations were correlated with presence or absence of renal scars
(renal injury) on DMSA scan. None of the patients had received any prior bladder 
care.
RESULTS: Twenty one patients had no renal scars and 9 patients had evidence of
renal scarring. Patients with renal scars were older at presentation, they had
greater degree of hydroureteronephrosis (P < or = 0.001) and vesicoureteric
reflux (P < or = 0.005). The incidence of high leak pressures (>25 cm of water, P
< or = 0.05), unacceptable bladder volumes (maximum cystometric capacity < 60%
for age, P < or = 0.005) and high risk Galloway's score (> 5, P < or = 0.05) was 
high in patients with associated renal scarring as compared to their nonscarred
counterparts. Three of these patients had serum creatinine >1 mg/dl (P < or =
0.005). The incidence of urinary complaints and positive urine cultures was also 
higher in these patients (NS).
CONCLUSION: Increasing age, evidence of hydroureteronephrosis and vesicoureteric 
reflux, high leak pressures, low bladder volume and high combined Galloway score 
(>5) define a high risk bladder in our population and predispose to renal injury 
in patients of myelodysplasia. Early referral for bladder risk assessment and
management of all myelodysplasia patients is recommended.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of oral antibiotic treatment alone with
treatment started parenterally and completed orally in children with a first
episode of acute pyelonephritis.
DESIGN: Multicentre, randomised controlled, open labelled, parallel group,
non-inferiority trial.
SETTING: 28 paediatric units in north east Italy.
PARTICIPANTS: 502 children aged 1 month to <7 years with clinical pyelonephritis.
INTERVENTION: Oral co-amoxiclav (50 mg/kg/day in three doses for 10 days) or
parenteral ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/day in a single parenteral dose) for three days,
followed by oral co-amoxiclav (50 mg/kg/day in three divided doses for seven
days). Main outcomes measures Primary outcome was the rate of renal scarring.
Secondary measures of efficacy were time to defervescence (<37 degrees C),
reduction in inflammatory indices, and percentage with sterile urine after 72
hours. An exploratory subgroup analysis was conducted in the children in whom
pyelonephritis was confirmed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy
within 10 days after study entry.
RESULTS: Intention to treat analysis showed no significant differences between
oral (n=244) and parenteral (n=258) treatment, both in the primary outcome
(scarring scintigraphy at 12 months 27/197 (13.7%) v 36/203 (17.7%), difference
in risk -4%, 95% confidence interval -11.1% to 3.1%) and secondary outcomes (time
to defervescence 36.9 hours (SD 19.7) v 34.3 hours (SD 20), mean difference 2.6
(-0.9 to 6.0); white cell count 9.8x10(9)/l (SD 3.5) v 9.5x10(9)/l (SD 3.1), mean
difference 0.3 (-0.3 to 0.9); percentage with sterile urine 185/186 v 203/204,
risk difference -0.05% (-1.5% to 1.4%)). Similar results were found in the
subgroup of 278 children with confirmed acute pyelonephritis on scintigraphy at
study entry.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with oral antibiotics is as effective as parenteral then
oral treatment in the management of the first episode of clinical pyelonephritis 
in children.

BACKGROUND: Renal duplication is the most common malformation of the urinary
tract and is frequently seen among children with urinary tract infection (UTI).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate problems in the interpretation of dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA) scintigraphy and to establish the range of relative function in
uncomplicated unilateral duplication.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 303 children less than 2 years
of age with first time non-obstructive urinary tract infection investigated by
both urography and DMSA scintigraphy. At DMSA scintigraphy, renal lesions and/or 
relative function below 45% was considered abnormal. Urography was used as
reference for the diagnosis of duplication.
RESULTS: Duplex kidneys were found in 22 of 303 patients (7%). Of the 16 children
with unilateral duplication, 10 had bilaterally undamaged kidneys with a range of
relative function varying between 51% and 57% in the duplex kidney. In two of the
children with unilateral duplication the imaging results were discordant.
CONCLUSION: There was risk of underdiagnosis as well as overdiagnosis of renal
damage at scintigraphy. Although it is important to be aware of this risk, the
rate of misinterpretation was low. A range of 51% to 57% can be used as the limit
for normality of the relative function of a unilateral duplex kidney.

Is a complete urological evaluation necessary in all newborns with asymptomatic
renal ectopia?

Sciences, University of Messina, Messina, Italy. arenaf@unime.it

AIM: To evaluate if a complete urological screening is justified by potential
urological anomalies in newborns or infants with asymptomatic renal ectopia (RE).
METHODS: The database records of 60 consecutive neonatal cases of RE diagnosed at
the authors' hospital from 1990 to 2004 were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: At diagnosis, mean patient age was 1.6 months. In 58 of 60 patients, the
suspected diagnosis of RE was made during prenatal or postnatal screening
ultrasonography, including two newborns with anorectal malformation. There were
24 patients with crossed RE (C-RE) and 36 patients with simple RE (S-RE). A
solitary RE was present in two patients. The most frequent associated urological 
abnormality was vesico-ureteral reflux (37.5% of C-RE and 16.6% of S-RE).
Hydronephrosis was detected in seven RE and five contralateral kidneys. An
obstructive megaureter was present in one patient with C-RE. In 40% of S-RE and
92.9% of C-RE, the (99m)Tc DMSA documented reduction of function of RE. The
longitudinal diameter of the ectopic kidney was significantly smaller than the
contralateral one. Other non-renal diseases were present in 15% of patients, of
which the most frequent was cryptorchidism (6.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: A complete urological evaluation is necessary in newborns with C-RE 
for the high incidence of associated urological anomalies, of which VUR is the
most frequent. A complete urological evaluation is also reasonable in patients
with S-RE who have a pelvic dilatation. No diagnosis or treatment of the
associated urological diseases, in consideration of congenital decreased function
of the ectopic kidney, might predispose these children to improvement of renal
function impairment.

Sciences, Urmia, Iran. anikibakhsh@yahoo.com

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of Technetium Tc
99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy in the diagnosis of
urinary tract infection (UTI) in children with suspected infection but with a
negative urine culture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of all children with suspected or definite
diagnosis of UTI presented during a 2-year period were reviewed in this study.
Abnormal findings on renal scintigraphy, voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), and
ultrasonography were evaluated and compared between the patients with the
definite diagnosis of UTI and those with suspected UTI and negative urine
cultures.
RESULTS: Of 210 patients, 86 had a definite diagnosis of UTI (group 1) and 124
had suspected UTI without a positive culture (group 2). Abnormal findings on DMSA
scans were seen in 76 patients (88.4%) in group 1 and 84 (67.7%) in group 2.
Vesicoureteral reflux was detected by VCUG in 50% and 32.3% of the patients in
groups 1 and 2, respectively. In group 2, vesicoureteral reflux was seen in 40.5%
of the patients with abnormal DMSA scan. Ultrasonography findings were abnormal
in 51.3% and 39.8% of the patients with abnormal DMSA scan findings in groups 1
and 2, respectively.
CONCLUSION: According to our findings, in children with a negative urine culture 
and abnormal urinalysis, 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy is helpful in diagnosing
UTI and vesicoureteral reflux; we recommend VCUG when DMSA scan supports UTI
despite a negative urine culture and a normal ultrasonography.

Pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid [99m Tc-(V)DMSA] brain
scintitomography--a plausible non-invasive depicter of glioblastoma proliferation
and therapy response.

The biological behavior and prognosis of gliomas depend largely on cellular
proliferation, resistance to chemotherapy, and metastatic potential.
Proliferative propensity has significant implications on patient management but
its assessment requires tissue sampling; the non-invasive estimation of brain
tumor proliferation represents therefore a major goal. Pentavalent technetium-99 
m dimercapto-succinic acid [99m Tc-(V)DMSA] is a tumor-seeking radiotracer
displaying affinity for gliomas; its intracellular accumulation is directly
linked to cell proliferation. We performed a tomographic 99m Tc-(V)DMSA brain
scan in a 35-year-old male baring a recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, to depict 
its proliferative disposition. The patient had been diagnosed 14 months earlier
and had been submitted to surgery, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and
temozolomide-based chemotherapy. On clinical suspicion of recurrence 5 months
later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion at the site of preceded
surgery, which was treated by imatinib mesylate. No improvement was ascertained
the following months and radiographic assessment verified tumor progression.
Scintitomography revealed avid radiotracer uptake in the entirety of the lesion
(the distribution of radioactivity closely conforming to the morphological tumor 
boundaries), an indication that the neoplasm demonstrated no substantial
proliferation decline in response to imatinib. The patient deceased a few weeks
later. Mounting in vivo and in vitro evidence indicates that 99m Tc-(V)DMSA is a 
credible non-invasive proliferation depicter, its cellular accumulation linked
closely to phosphate uptake and kinase pathway activation. A potential role in
patient management, prognosis estimation, and therapy response monitoring could
occur for this tracer.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease of childhood. The investigation
of UTI in children has been the subject of debate and controversy for many years.
Most workers agree that the first imaging modality to be used should be an
ultrasound examination to exclude obstruction, structural abnormalities, and
renal calculi. The role of (99m)Tc dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) in
the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is becoming increasingly important. Many
argue that if the DMSA study is normal at the time of acute UTI, no further
investigation is required because the kidneys have not been involved and thus
there will be no late sequelae. Others use the acute DMSA study to determine the 
intensity of antibiotic therapy. The importance of the role of vesico-ureteric
reflux (VUR) is being debated. Some workers will only proceed to cystography to
detect VUR if the DMSA study is abnormal, whereas others advocate a more
aggressive approach. VUR can be identified by a variety of radiological and
scintigraphic techniques. Although the radiological cystogram is the gold
standard and is essential in the first UTI in a male patient, to exclude the
presence of posterior urethral valves, radionuclide cystograms are advantageous
in other situations. Suprapubic cystography techniques have been described to
overcome the trauma of urethral catheterization but have not been widely
accepted.

PURPOSE: Several new somatostatin analogues have been developed for the diagnosis
and therapy of different tumours. Since somatostatin receptors are often
over-expressed in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), the aim of our study was to 
evaluate the utility of scintigraphy with the somatostatin analogue
(99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC in MTC in comparison with other diagnostic techniques.
METHODS: Forty-five patients with MTC, aged 14-83 years, were investigated.
Scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC (Tektrotyd) was performed 2 and 4 h
post injection of 740 MBq (20 mCi) of the tracer. Other imaging techniques were
also applied and analysed in individual cases (ultrasonography, computed
tomography, (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA, (131)I-MIBG, (99m)Tc-MDP, (111)In-DTPA-octreotide
and (18)F-FDG-PET) and compared with (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC.
RESULTS: In group 1 (eight patients before thyroidectomy), uptake of the tracer
was found in the primary tumours. In group 2 (six patients with remission), a
false positive result was found in one patient; in the remaining five patients,
no pathological foci were visualised. In group 3 (31 patients with post-surgical 
hypercalcitoninaemia), scintigraphy was true positive in 23 patients (74.2%):
uptake in the thyroid bed was found in five patients, in the lymph nodes in 18
and in bone metastases in four. Using (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy, the
overall sensitivity was 79.5%, specificity 83.3%, accuracy 80.0%, positive
predictive value 96.9% and negative predictive value 38.5%.
CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC is clinically useful for scintigraphy in the
follow-up of patients with MTC. It can be used in clinical practice for
preoperative evaluation, for localisation of local recurrence or distant
metastases and particularly for therapy decision making.

Bladder ultrasound in the evaluation of the efficacy of dextranomer/hyaluronic
acid injection for treatment of vesicoureteral reflux.

Izmir, Turkey.

PURPOSE: To determine whether sonographic examination of subureteral implants
after endoscopic dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (DHA) injection would help to
evaluate the efficacy of this method in the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients (49 ureters) who underwent endoscopic 
subureteral DHA injection were evaluated using voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) 
and bladder sonography for a mean duration of 2.1 years (range, 3 months to 6.5
years) after treatment. Patient records-including the results of VCUG, renal
sonography, Dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, and periodic urinary
analysis-were also reviewed to determine the outcome of treatment.
RESULTS: Reflux was corrected in 43/49 (88%) ureters (complete cure in 38,
downgrading of reflux in 5). No change was noted in 6 (12%) ureters on VCUG. The 
reflux was found to be corrected in 19/22 (86%) ureters, with the implants
clearly identifiable on sonography. However, reflux was documented in only 3/27
(11%) ureters, around which no implant was seen on sonography.
CONCLUSION: The identification of the implant in the subureteral region by
bladder sonography correlated with resolution of reflux in the early
postinjection period. On the other hand, the majority of the implants disappeared
on sonography in the long term despite correction of reflux. Therefore, we
believe that the use of bladder sonography is not useful in the evaluation of
patients in long-term follow-up.

Thessaloniki, Greece.

BACKGROUND: Tc 99m DMSA scintigraphy is regarded as the gold standard for the
detection and localization of acute pyelonephritis (APN) in children. Power
Doppler sonography (PD US) is a radiation-free and cost-effective technique that 
could be useful in the diagnosis of APN in children.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the predictive value of PD US with DMSA scintigraphy in the
diagnosis of APN in children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 74 neonates and children with clinical findings
consistent with possible upper urinary tract infection were evaluated with PD US 
and DMSA scintigraphy. Children with anatomic (grey-scale) abnormalities were
excluded. A total of 147 kidneys were examined within the first 48 h after the
onset of symptoms. Each kidney was divided into three zones (upper, middle, and
lower third).
RESULTS: APN was diagnosed by PD US in 46 kidneys. Sensitivity and specificity
for detecting APN using DMSA scintigraphy as the reference standard were 73.8%
and 85.7%, respectively. There was good agreement between PD US and DMSA
scintigraphy in the localization of lesions.
CONCLUSION: In clinically suspected APN, PD US has acceptable specificity and
sensitivity, if performed within the first 48 h and could be helpful in neonates 
and children under 3 months of age in whom the use of scintigraphy is generally
discouraged.

Arsenic and lead induced free radical generation and their reversibility
following chelation.

Establishment, Gwalior, India. sjsflora@hotmail.com

Health hazards caused by heavy metals have become a great concern to the
population. Lead and arsenic are one of the most important current global
environmental toxicants. Their toxic manifestations are being considered caused
primarily due to the imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant homeostasis
and also due to a high affinity of these metals for thiol groups on functional
proteins. They also interfere with a number of other body functions and are known
to affect central nervous system (CNS), hematopoietic system, liver and kidneys
and produce serious disorders. They produce both acute and chronic poisoning, of 
which chronic poisoning is more dangerous as its very difficult to revert back to
normal condition after chronic exposure to these insidious metals present in our 
life. Despite many years of research, we are still far from an effective
treatment of chronic plumbism and arsenicosis. Current approved treatment lies in
the administration of chelating agents that forms an insoluble complex with the
metal and removes it. They have been used clinically as antidotes for treating
acute and chronic poisoning. The most widely used chelating agents are calcium
disodium ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid (CaNa2EDTA), D-penicillamine and
British anti-lewisite (BAL). Meso 2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), an analogue
of BAL, has been tried successfully in animals as well as in humans. But it is
unable to remove the metal from intracellular sites. Effective chelation therapy 
for intoxication by heavy metals depends on whether the chelating agents are able
to reach the intracellular site where the heavy metal is firmly bound. One of the
important approaches has been the use of combination therapy. This includes use
of structurally different chelators or a combination of an adjuvant/ antioxidant/
herbal extracts and a chelator to provide better clinical/ biochemical recovery. 
A number of other strategies have been suggested to minimize the numerous
problems. This article presents the recent development made in this area with
possible directions for future research.

INTRODUCTION: The complementary and alternative medicine practice of prescribing 
chelators to children with autism is based on the premise that the chronic
symptoms of autism can be ameliorated by reducing heavy metal body burden.
However, there has not been definitive evidence, published to date, to support
the assertion that children with autism are at increased risk of an excess
chelatable body burden of heavy metals. The oral chelator
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) can be used diagnostically to mobilize
heavy metals from extravascular pools, enhancing the identification of
individuals who have a chelatable body burden.
METHODS: Seventeen children with autism and five typically developing children
were enrolled in a pilot study to test for chelatable body burden of Arsenic
(As), Cadmium (Cd), Lead (Pb), and Mercury (Hg). Evaluation included a
questionnaire regarding potential exposure to heavy metals, diet restrictions, a 
baseline 24-hour urine collection, and a DMSA-provoked urine collection. Urine
collections were sent for As, Cd, Pb, and Hg quantification by Inductively
Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. Unprovoked reference ranges were used in the
interpretation of all collections.
RESULTS: Fifteen autistic children and four typically developing children
completed the study. Three autistic subjects excreted one metal in greater
quantity during the provoked excretion than baseline. Two of these were very
close to the limit of detection. In the third case, the provoked excretion of
mercury was between the upper limit of normal and lower limit of the potentially 
toxic reference range. Fish was removed from this child's diet for greater than
one month, and the provoked excretion test repeated. The repeat excretion of
mercury was within the normal range.
CONCLUSION: In the absence a proven novel mode of heavy metal toxicity, the
proportion of autistic participants in this study whose DMSA provoked excretion
results demonstrate an excess chelatable body burden of As, Cd, Pb, or Hg is
zero. The confidence interval for this proportion is 0-22%.

Inter- and intraobserver variability of (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy: impact
of oblique views.

(99m)Tc-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy is a frequently used
diagnostic test to assess the presence and severity of cortical damage. The aim
of this study is to investigate the variability in the interpretation of
(99m)Tc-DMSA scans, evaluate the usefulness of oblique images, and assess their
impact on scan interpretation.METHODS: Two experienced nuclear medicine
physicians independently interpreted 100 (99m)Tc-DMSA scans (197 kidneys) 4
times. Interpretation was twice based on posterior projection images and twice
based on posterior and posterior oblique projection images. For each kidney, the 
observers had to choose between the following results: normal, abnormal, and
indeterminate. The indices of variability used were the percentage of agreement, 
kappa-statistic, and marginal homogeneity.
RESULTS: Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility (kappa-values) varied
between 0.683 and 0.708 and between 0.609 and 0.671, respectively, for posterior 
images. Disagreement in (99m)Tc-DMSA scan interpretation occurred in 18% of
kidneys within observers and in 21% of kidneys between observers when only
posterior images were used. Oblique views changed the interpretation in 14% and
11.5% of kidneys for the first and second observers, respectively. The use of
oblique views increased the agreement rate within and between observers
(kappa-values, 0.725-0.812 and 0.768-0.732, respectively; mean agreement, 86.5
and 87.25, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Oblique views were found useful in approximately 13% of kidneys and
affected inter- and intraobserver variability. Our results suggest that oblique
views should be used routinely in children with clinically suspected urinary
tract infection to reliably interpret images.

Slow recovery from severe inorganic arsenic poisoning despite treatment with DMSA
(2.3-dimercaptosuccinic acid).

A 39-year-old woman was hospitalized for nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and weakness
of unknown etiology. Her condition progressively deteriorated and she developed
multiple organ failure and tetraplegia. The diagnosis of inorganic arsenic
poisoning was established by measurements of arsenic in urine and serum, showing 
2,000 microg/L (normal < 10 microg/L) and 290 mug/Kg (normal < 2 microg/Kg),
respectively. Hair arsenic was 57 mg/kg (normal < 0.2 mg/kg). Chelating therapy
with 2.3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) 600 mg three times daily was given for a 
period of 45 days with three abruption periods during a total of 13 days. The
clinical manifestations of arsenic toxicosis disappeared very slowly and five
years after the hospitalization she still suffers from peripheral neuropathy.
Although the use of DMSA was associated with increased urinary elimination of
arsenic and a decrease in blood arsenic concentrations, DMSA treatment probably
had no significant effect on the total body clearance in our patient. The source 
of the poisoning was never detected, nor the motivation behind it. Criminal
intent was suspected, but no verdict was given.

Combined administration of iron and monoisoamyl-DMSA in the treatment of chronic 
arsenic intoxication in mice.

Modi M(1), Flora SJ.

(1)Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Defense Research and Development
Establishment, Jhansi Road, Gwalior 474002, India.

Co-administration of iron in combination with monoisoamyl dimercaptosuccinic acid
(MiADMSA) against chronic arsenic poisoning in mice was studied. Mice preexposed 
to arsenic (25 ppm in drinking water for 6 months) mice were treated with MiADMSA
(50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) either alone or in combination with iron (75 or 150
mg/kg, orally) once daily for 5 days. Arsenic exposure led to a significant
depletion of blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity,
hematocrit, and white blood cell (WBC) counts accompanied by small decline in
blood hemoglobin level. Hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) level, catalase and
superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities showed a significant decrease while,
oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS)
levels increased on arsenic exposure, indicating arsenic-induced hepatic
oxidative stress. Liver aspartate and alanine transaminases (AST and ALT)
activities also decreased significantly on arsenic exposure. Kidney GSH, GSSG,
catalase level and SOD activities remained unchanged, while, TBARS level
increased significantly following arsenic exposure. Brain GSH, glutathione
peroxidase (GPx), and SOD activities decreased, accompanied by a significant
elevation of TBARS level after chronic arsenic exposure. Treatment with MiADMSA
was marginally effective in reducing ALAD activity, while administration of iron 
was ineffective when given alone. Iron when co-administered with MiADMSA restored
blood ALAD activity. Administration of iron alone had no beneficial effects on
hepatic oxidative stress, while in combination with MiADMSA it produced
significant decline in hepatic TBARS level compared to the individual effect of
MiADMSA. Renal biochemical variables were insensitive to any of the treatments.
Combined administration of iron with MiADMSA also had no additional beneficial
effect over the individual protective effect of MiADMSA on brain oxidative
stress. Interestingly, combined administration of iron with MiADMSA provided more
pronounced depletion of blood arsenic, while no additional beneficial effects on 
tissue arsenic level over the individual effect of MiADMSA were noted. The
results lead us to conclude that iron supplementation during chelation has some
beneficial effects particularly on heme synthesis pathway and blood arsenic
concentration.

Trapping of technetium-99m albumin macroaggregate and other four
radiopharmaceuticals by blood clots in vitro.

Radiopharmaceuticals are known to interact with the blood components (i.e. the
red blood cells, serum proteins etc) but so far, there have been no data
regarding their purely mechanical trapping in thrombi. The experiments presented 
in this communication provide evidence that the technetium-99m labeled albumin
macroaggregate ((99m)Tc-MAA), apparently due to its particle size, can be almost 
quantitatively retained in the in vitro model described. These results can be
extrapolated in vivo and offer a plausible explanation for either the "hot spot" 
artifact, occasionally seen in lung perfusion imaging or for the partial trapping
of (99m)Tc-MAA by a thrombus at the tip of a subclavian catheter, as has been
recently reported. Control experiments were also run using (99m)Tc-methylene
diphosphonate ((99m)Tc-MDP), (99m)Tc(III)-dimercaptosuccinic acid
((99m)Tc(III)-DMSA), (99m)Tc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile ((99m)Tc-MIBI) and sodium
pertechnetate (Na(99m)TcO(4)), in order to study the extent of trapping of these 
radiopharmaceuticals under identical incubation conditions. (99m)Tc-MDP and
(99m)Tc(III)-DMSA exhibited the lowest blood clot uptake (partially non-specific 
and partially mechanical trapping), while in the case of (99m)Tc-MIBI and
Na(99m)TcO(4), besides mechanical and non-specific clot-trapping, transport and
retention inside the red blood cells was also observed.

Morphology and release kinetics of technetium-99m(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid
loaded, poly(lactic-co-glycolic)acid microspheric delivery system. An
experimental approach that may be used for targeted radiation treatment.

Shukla J(1), Bandopadhyaya GP, Varma IK, Kumar R, Maulik SK.

Author information:

Delhi 110029, India.

The aim of our studies was to formulate a system that delivers the required
radiation dose to the tumor site and minimize the harm to other organs or
tissues. The poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid, 75:25; 50:50) microspheric radiation 
delivery system was fabricated using double emulsion solvent evaporation
technique for the encapsulation of technetium-99m(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid
((99m)Tc(V)DMSA). Microspheres of different sizes (0.2-20.0 mum) were prepared.
The initial burst in microspheres with 10% and 1% poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) in the
presence of poly ethylene glucol (PEG) was as 30% and 16% respectively, however
the initial burst in microspheres without the PEG was 9% and 1.2% respectively.
The results indicated that smaller microspheres had higher encapsulation (68%) of
(99m)Tc(V)DMSA than larger microspheres (15%). The stirring rate changed the
surface of the microspheres from smooth spherical, to spherical, porous. The
ratio of co-polymers (75:25/50:50) affected the release kinetics. In conclusion, 
our studies with varied surfactant concentrations, co-polymer concentrations and 
speed of solvent evaporation, on the morphology and release kinetics of
(99m)Tc(V)DMSA from the microspheres, may be applied for the fabrication of
targeted radiotherapeutic microspheres by substituting (99m)Tc(V)DMSA with
rhenium-188 (V) DMSA ((188)Re(V)DMSA). (188)Re(V)DMSA is a therapeutic analogue
of (99m)Tc(V)DMSA and both share similar radiopharmaceutical properties.

OBJECTIVE: To study the change in oxidase and anti-oxidase in liver of the mice
poisoned by dimethylformamide (DMF), and the effects of the treatment with
sulfhydryl compounds in acute poisoning of DMF.
METHODS: The sulfhydryl compounds included sodium dimercaptopropane (Na-DMPS),
N-acetylcysteine (NAC), glutathione (GSH) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The
model of acute poisoning with DMF in mice was reproduced, and the left hepatic
lobes were harvested at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after DMF to detect the
dynamic changes in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and xanthine
oxidase (XOD) in liver homogenate. Treatment groups included intraperitoneal
injection of Na-DMPS, NAC, GSH, DMSA respectively. In the control groups, the
activities of XOD and SOD in liver were determined 24 hours after intragastric
administration of DMF.
RESULTS: The activities of XOD, SOD in liver were elevated at 24 hours after
intragastric administration of DMF (both P<0.01), and returned to the normal
levels at 48-72 hours. Compared to the poisoning group, the activities of XOD,
SOD in liver homogenate were significantly lowered after the treatment of
Na-DMPS, NAC and DMSA (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The activity of XOD in liver homogenate
was reduced 24 hours after treating with GSH (P<0.05), and no obvious change was 
observed in SOD (P>0.05). As far as the activity of SOD was concentrated,
Na-DMPS, NAC, DMSA showed better effects than GSH (all P<0.05), and Na-DMPS was
the best. There was no significant differences in XOD among the four sulfhydryl
compounds.
CONCLUSION: The balance of oxidase and anti-oxidase is interrupted by DMF, which 
might be one of the mechanisms of damage to the liver. Na-DMPS, NAC and DMSA
could protect liver function by restoring the balance.

AIM: To describe paediatricians' reported ordering of renal tract imaging of
children following urinary tract infection.
METHODS: This is a piloted self-administered survey. A total of 354 randomly
sampled practising paediatricians in Australia participated in the survey. The
survey included 12 clinical scenarios that varied with age, gender and fever.
Respondents indicated their likelihood of ordering renal ultrasound, micturating 
cystourethrogram (MCU) and dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA) from 0 to 100%.
RESULTS: Response rate was 74.6% (264/354). For all clinical scenarios the median
probability of ordering an ultrasound was 100% with little variability. For
children aged 2 months, likelihood of ordering an MCU was 100%, with little
variability, but was 70% for 3-year-olds with fever (45% without fever), and 5%
for 6-year-olds with very large variability. Median likelihood of ordering a DMSA
was 80% at 2 months, 60% at 3 years and 20% at 6 years (40%, 15%, 5% without
fever, respectively). Variability was large for all scenarios and DMSA ordering. 
Child gender did not influence ordering practices.
CONCLUSIONS: Renal tract imaging practice across paediatricians shows consistent,
approximately 100% use of the least invasive modality, ultrasound. In contrast,
there is considerable variation in the reported ordering of the more invasive
tests MCU and DMSA. Doctors order these tests more in younger children and when
fever is present.

Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London SE1 7EH, UK. manish.sinha@gstt.nhs.uk

BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate over the radiological investigations of
children with urinary tract infections (UTIs) with some authorities suggesting
that ultrasound scan (USS) alone is an accurate tool to diagnose renal
parenchymal scarring post-pyelonephritis. All studies on this subject have been
performed at paediatric teaching centres whereas most children with UTIs are
managed by General Paediatricians in District General Hospitals (DGHs) in the
United Kingdom. We wished to identify whether results of scans in DGHs differed
from those in teaching centres.
METHODS: We looked at all children with a clinical history of UTIs having a DMSA 
and USS over a one year period in two DGHs and one teaching centre. A total of
476 children's results were reviewed, 297 from the DGHs and 179 from the teaching
centre.
RESULTS: The cohort had a total of 949 renal units. There were 79 scarred renal
units (kidneys) on DMSA (8%) in 72 patients (15%). Just 18 renal units were
detected as being scarred on USS (22.8%). Nine of 32 scarred renal units in the
teaching centre were detected compared with nine of 47 in the DGHs (P = 0.40).
Thirty-nine (49%) of the scarred renal units were in patients >5-years old. Of
these 12 (30.7%) were detected on USS, nine of 17 within the teaching centre
compared with just three of 22 at the DGHs (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Overall only a small percentage of scars are detected on USS. In the 
over 5-year old group, where USS alone might be preferred, DGHs were
significantly worse at detecting scarred kidneys. We conclude that if the
detection of renal scars is a prime reason for imaging in children with UTIs,
ultrasonography alone is inappropriate at any age and DMSA ought to be the
primary investigation.

An electrochemical sensor for the detection of copper(II) ions is described using
a meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) self-assembled gold electrode. First in
ammonia buffer pH 8, copper(II) ions complex with self-assembled monolayer (SAM) 
via the free carboxyl groups on immobilized meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(accumulation step). Then, the medium is exchanged to acetate buffer pH 4.6 and
the complexed Cu(II) ions are reduced in negative potential of -0.3V (reduction
step). Following this, reduced coppers are oxidized and detected by differential 
pulse (DP) voltammetric scans from -0.3 to +0.7V (stripping step). The effective 
parameters in sensor response were examined. The detection limit of copper(II)
was 1.29mugL(-1) and R.S.D. for 200mugL(-1) was 1.06%. The calibration curve was 
linear for 3-225mugL(-1) copper(II). The procedure was applied for determination 
of Cu(II) to natural waters and human hairs. The accuracy and precision of
results were comparable to those obtained by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy
(FAAS).

Mercury has been a known as a toxic substance for centuries. Whilst the clinical 
features of acute mercury poisoning have been well described, chronic low dose
exposure to mercury remains poorly characterised and its potential role in
various chronic disease states remains controversial. Low molecular weight
thiols, i.e. sulfhydryl containing molecules such as cysteine, are emerging as
important factors in the transport and distribution of mercury throughout the
body due to the phenomenon of "Molecular Mimicry" and its role in the molecular
transport of mercury. Chelation agents such as the dithiols sodium
2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfate (DMPS) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
are the treatments of choice for mercury toxicity. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a
disulfide, and its metabolite dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), a dithiol, have also
been shown to have chelation properties when used in an appropriate manner.
Whilst N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH) have been recommended in the
treatment of mercury toxicity in the past, an examination of available evidence
suggests these agents may in fact be counterproductive. Zinc and selenium have
also been shown to exert protective effects against mercury toxicity, most likely
mediated by induction of the metal binding proteins metallothionein and
selenoprotein-P. Evidence suggests however that the co-administration of selenium
and dithiol chelation agents during treatment may also be counter-productive.
Finally, the issue of diagnostic testing for chronic, historical or low dose
mercury poisoning is considered including an analysis of the influence of ligand 
interactions and nutritional factors upon the accuracy of "chelation challenge"
tests.

S- and N-Oxide Reductases.

Cheng VW, Weiner JH.

Escherichia coli is a versatile facultative anaerobe that can respire on a number
of terminal electron acceptors, including oxygen, fumarate, nitrate, and S- and
N-oxides. Anaerobic respiration using S- and N-oxides is accomplished by
enzymatic reduction of these substrates by dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DmsABC) 
and trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (TorCA). Both DmsABC and TorCA are
membrane-associated redox enzymes that couple the oxidation of menaquinol to the 
reduction of S- and N-oxides in the periplasm. DmsABC is membrane bound and is
composed of a membrane-extrinsic dimer with a 90.4-kDa catalytic subunit (DmsA)
and a 23.1-kDa electron transfer subunit (DmsB). These subunits face the
periplasm and are held to the membrane by a 30.8-kDa membrane anchor subunit
(DmsC). The enzyme provides the scaffold for an electron transfer relay composed 
of a quinol binding site, five [4Fe-4S] clusters, and a molybdo-bis(molybdopterin
guanine dinucleotide) (present nomenclature: Mo-bis-pyranopterin) (Mo-bisMGD)
cofactor. TorCA is composed of a soluble periplasmic subunit (TorA, 92.5 kDa)
containing a Mo-bis-MGD. TorA is coupled to the quinone pool via a pentaheme c
subunit (TorC, 40.4 kDa) in the membrane. Both DmsABC and TorCA require
system-specific chaperones (DmsD or TorD) for assembly, cofactor insertion,
and/or targeting to the Tat translocon. In this chapter, we discuss the complex
regulation of the dmsABC and torCAD operons, the poorly understood paralogues,
and what is known about the assembly and translocation to the periplasmic space
by the Tat translocon.

urinary infection.

The aim of this study was to define in children younger than 2 years of age the
diagnostic significance of clinical and laboratory findings to localize site of
febrile urinary tract infection. We reviewed the records of 185 children younger 
than 2 years of age admitted to hospital with febrile urinary tract infection.
Patients were divided into having either acute pyelonephritis or acute cystitis
according to the presence or absence of acute lesions on dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA) renal scintigraphy. Clinical and laboratory [white blood cell count (WBC),
urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP)]
findings were compared between the two groups using Student's t test, chi-square 
test, and multivariate analysis. Patients with pyelonephritis had statistically
significant higher age, WBC, ESR, and CRP than those with cystitis. Although the 
sensitivity of the tests was 80-100%, their specificity was <28%. On multivariate
analysis, 33% of patients with cystitis were diagnosed as having pyelonephritis, 
whereas 22% of those with pyelonephritis were considered to have cystitis. Given 
the low specificity of clinical findings and available laboratory tests to define
the site of urine infection in this age group, we recommend DMSA renal scintigram
as the test of choice to make the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in these
patients.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common clinical disorder in younger infants
and children and may result in permanent renal damage. The inflammatory cytokines
interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 play an important role in response to bacterial
infection. This prospective study investigated the association between serum and 
urine IL-6 and IL-8 levels and acute pyelonephritis confirmed by
(99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. A total of 78 children aged 1-121
months with a diagnosis of first-time febrile UTI were included. The following
inflammatory markers were assessed: fever; white blood cells count (WBC);
C-reactive protein (CRP); and serum and urine IL-6 and IL-8. The patients were
divided into the acute pyelonephritis group (n=42) and the lower UTI group (n=36)
according to the results of DMSA scan. Fever, WBC and CRP levels were
significantly higher in children with acute pyelonephritis than in those with
lower UTI (all p <0.001). Significantly, higher initial serum and urine IL-6 and 
IL-8 levels were found in children with acute pyelonephritis than in those with
lower UTI (all p <0.001). Serum and urine IL-6 in children with acute
pyelonephritis were positively correlated with fever, CRP and leucocyturia. These
results indicate that both serum and urine IL-6 and IL-8 levels, particularly
IL-6, are useful diagnostic tools for early recognition of acute pyelonephritis
in febrile children.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Taipei City Hospital, Yangming Branch and School of 
Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Tapei, Taiwan. gwan1998@gmail.com

BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common causes of
unexplained fever in infants with a reported prevalence range of 5-11%. The
clinical and laboratory findings were reviewed, and diagnosis and treatment for
95 infants with primary UTI were evaluated in this study.
METHODS: All patients underwent renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrogram
and 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan during hospitalization before
treatment, with treatment consisting of 2- or 4-week appropriated antibiotic
therapy for the patients associated upper UTI, followed by a second DMSA scan 6
months after therapy.
RESULTS: In the present study the main symptom of UTI in infants was fever. High 
white blood cell count was not necessarily present, and urinalysis was also an
imperfect diagnostic tool for discriminating UTI. In addition, colony count from 
urine culture and kidney ultrasonography was not efficacious in terms of
predicting the occurrence of pyelonephritis. Intravenous antibiotic for 1 week
followed by 3 weeks of the same oral antibiotic provided good prophylaxis for
uncomplicated pyelonephritis.
CONCLUSION: Four weeks of antibiotic treatment resulted in good recovery from
pyelonephritis in the present sample of infant primary UTI cases. voiding
cystourethrogram, DMSA and ultrasonography scanning should be performed in
primary infant UTI.

Combined laparoscopic and vaginal approach for nephrectomy, ureterectomy, and
removal of a large rectovaginal endometriotic nodule causing loss of renal
function.

A late consequence of ureteral endometriosis is the silent loss of renal function
caused by progressive "enclosure" of the lower part of the ureter by the
endometriosis. In our experience, in cases of severe loss of renal function with 
cortical atrophy and residual kidney function (evaluated by Tc99 DMSA
scintigraphy) of less than 15%, removal of the endometriosis combined with
ureterolysis does not allow recovery of renal function. A nonfunctioning kidney
associated with hydronephrosis is a risk factor for vascular hypertension,
recurrent pyelonephritis, or kidney stones and therefore an indication for
nephrectomy. By means of a case report, this paper describes the combination of
laparoscopic nephrectomy, ureterectomy, removal of the rectovaginal endometriotic
nodule, and extraction of the kidney through the vagina.

PET is a successful modality to detect cancer and in recent years has
demonstrated a great diagnostic value in large series of tumour types. PET
combines high sensitivity and reasonable resolution, and offers the ability to
perform whole body scans. 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG)-PET has also been used to
diagnose tumours of neuroendocrine origin. Even if 18F-FDG has been successfully 
and widely employed in oncology, it has not demonstrated a significant uptake in 
well differentiated neuroendocrine tissues. Thus 18F-FDG is not a good tracer for
neuroendocrine tumours, as FDG-PET imaging of number of GEP tumours revealed
increased glucose metabolism only in less differentiated GEP tumours with high
proliferative activity and in metastatising MTC associated with rapidly
increasing CEA levels. In such a situation, additional 18F-FDG PET should be
performed only if somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (alone or with 99mTc-DMSA)
is negative. On the contrary, other positron emitter tracers seem to be more
promising. 68Ga-DOTA-NOC (tetraazycyclododecanetetraacetic
acid-[1-Nal3]-octreotide) has been used as a positron emitter tracer for the
detection of NETs in preliminary studies. A serotonin precursor
5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) labelled with 11C has shown an increased uptake in
carcinoids. This uptake seems to be selective and some clinical evidence has
demonstrated that it allows the detection of more lesions with PET than with CT
or octreotide scintigraphy. Another radiopharmaceutical in the development for
PET is 11C-L-DOPA, which seems to be useful in imaging endocrine pancreatic
tumours.

Urinary tract infection: one lingering effect of childhood kidney
diseases--review of the literature.

Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand. vprayong@msn.com

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a possible warning sign of the presence of
anomalies of the urinary tract. Following a UTI there is concern with recurrences
which can contribute to scarring which may lead to hypertension,
pregnancy-induced hypertension and even renal failure in later years. Prospective
studies using 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) have shown that
30%-40% of children will have renal scarring after febrile UTI, regardless of the
presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Many studies have
demonstrated that VUR is an important risk factor for renal scarring after UTI.
Hypertension affects at least 10% of children with renal scarring, and in adults 
with reflux nephropathy (RN), the prevalence of hypertension is also much higher 
(38%-50%). UTI, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) or renal function
deterioration alone or in some combination has been reported to be as high as 39%
in women with renal scarring. RN is one of the important causes of end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. Prevention of renal scar development should
reduce the incidence of hypertension in patients as they age. The appropriate
management of childhood UTI includes education of parents, patients and general
physicians to be sure that everyone is aware of not only the current condition,
but also the possibility of future UTI-related situations.IN CONCLUSION: UTI
itself is a warning sign of possible anomalies of the urinary tract, renal
problems and/or chronic renal complications. Although VUR is primarily a disease 
of childhood, scarring from the disease can cause problems in later years, with
the complicating factor that because only the renal scar remains, the VUR may be 
forgotten and not considered when diagnosing the current problem.

Outcome of laparoscopic upper-pole nephrectomy in children with duplex systems.

Dénes FT(1), Danilovic A, Srougi M.

Author information: 
(1)Urologic Clinic, São Paulo University, São Paulo, Brazil.

PURPOSE: To report the results of laparoscopic upper-pole nephrectomy for
children with duplex systems.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen laparoscopic transperitoneal upper-pole
nephrectomies (11 on the left and 8 on the right) were performed in 17 patients
with complete pyelocaliceal duplication. Postoperative follow-up consisted of
clinical evaluation, as well as functional and image studies of the remaining
lower unit with renal ultrasonography, 99mTc-DMSA, voiding cystourethrography,
and urography or enhanced helical CT, according to individual needs.
RESULTS: The mean operative time was 147 minutes (range 110-180 minutes). There
were no conversions to open surgery and no transfusions. The mean follow-up was
57.1 months. Lower-unit function was preserved after 18 procedures (94.7%).
Transient asymptomatic urinary-tract infection was observed in 5 of 17 children
(29.4%). Vesicoureteral reflux resolved in 3 of 4 children (75%) and improved in 
the other, and all 7 ureteroceles associated with the resected upper unit were
decompressed, although two (28.6%) remained present asymptomatically by
ultrasonography. Empyema of the lower-ureteral stump was a late complication in 3
of the 19 duplex systems.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic transperitoneal polar nephrectomy in children with
pyelocaliceal duplication is feasible and presents all the advantages of
minimally invasive procedures. It has good long-term results, as judged by
preservation of the lower unit, regression of ureterocele and reflux, and
reduction in the incidence of infection.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, Southampton University
Hospitals Trust, UK. Sarah.Peel@suht.swest.nhs.uk

BACKGROUND: Although Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans are routinely used
to quantify relative renal function, no quantification method is universally
adopted. Audits using real patient data indicate reasonable consistency but, as
the true relative function is unknown, accuracy cannot be assessed. The aim was
to simulate realistic DMSA images that can be used to assess accuracy.
METHODS: Anatomical models were created from computed tomography (CT) scans of a 
patient who had also undergone DMSA imaging. Organs that take up DMSA were
outlined on CT and each assigned an activity concentration (with renal cortex and
medulla modelled separately). The simulated images were visually compared to the 
patient's clinical images and subtracted to identify differences. Iteration was
used on the posterior image to find the organ activities that produced the most
realistic simulated image. The optimal activity distribution was then used to
also simulate an anterior image. To assess the simulations, the percentage
difference was calculated between the counts in each kidney on the real and
simulated images.
RESULTS: Visually, the clinical and simulated images appear similar and the
subtracted images indicate only small differences. The percentage difference in
kidney counts between the images was less than 1% for both kidneys on the
posterior image and less than 5% on the anterior image. The cortex and medulla
activity concentrations were approximately equal.
CONCLUSION: A technique for realistic simulation of DMSA images has been devised 
and should prove useful for evaluating image analysis software.

Pre-clinical evaluation of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid as a radiation
nephrotoxicity protective agent during radiopeptide therapy of neuroendocrine
malignancy.

Moorin RE(1), Meyrick DP, Rose A.

Author information: 
(1)School of Population Health, The University of Western Australia, Perth,
Australia. rachael.moorin@uwa.edu.au

AIM: To determine if dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), an agent originally
developed as a safe non-toxic antidote for heavy metal poisoning, would be useful
as a kidney radiation dose reduction agent in patients undergoing radiopeptide
therapy for cancer.
METHODS: Thirty-six adult male Wistar rats were injected via the penile vein with
10 MBq of 177Lu-DOTA-tyr(3)-octreotate. At 30 min after the radiopeptide
injection, 18 of the animals (intervention group) were injected with 0.15 mg x
g(-1) of DMSA (i.p.). Samples were collected for gamma counting at 24 (n=12), 48 
(n=12) and 72 h (n=12) after administration of the radiopeptide. At each time
point, the percentage injected dose per gram of tissue in each sample of the six 
control animals was compared with that of the six animals from the DMSA injection
regimen.
RESULTS: The i.p. injection of 0.15 mg x g(-1) of DMSA 30 min following the
administration of the 177Lu-DOTATATE reduced the mean (95% CI) kidney retention
of radiopeptide by 15.6% (2.6-24.6) at 72 h while not significantly affecting
uptake in other organs. Statistical testing of the difference between the two
groups of animals (DMSA versus controls) at 72 h post-administration of the
radiopeptide indicated only a 3% chance that the magnitude of the reduction in
kidney radiopeptide retention observed would be expected due to natural variation
(i.e., if there was no difference between the groups).
CONCLUSION: This study has indicated that DMSA has the potential to selectively
reduce radiopeptide kidney retention. Further work is necessary to determine the 
most effective dose of DMSA and the most effective timing regimen, and to examine
the clinical efficacy of several other chelating agents.

Mercury intoxication in a 2-year-old girl: a diagnostic challenge for the
physician.

A 2-year-old girl presented with hypertension, anorexia and vomiting,
restlessness, insomnia and acrodynia. Her blood pressure upon arrival was 145/98 
mmHg. Ultrasound of the abdomen, CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis, and
echocardiogram, were normal. Urinary levels of catecholamines were elevated,
urine level of mercury was found to be high (33.2 microg/g creatinine), although 
blood level was normal (>0.5 microg/dl, reference value 0-4 microg/dl). Following
a 1-month course of oral treatment with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) the
child's symptoms and signs resolved, and urinary mercury and catecholamines
levels normalized. Mercury intoxication should be suspected in a patient with
severe hypertension, personality changes and acrodynia. Normal blood levels of
mercury do not exclude this diagnosis, and catecholamine levels may serve as a
surrogate marker for confirmation of the diagnosis and to evaluate response to
treatment.

Korea.

PURPOSES: To assess the efficacy of laparoscopic nephrectomy for a single-system 
ectopic ureter draining a dysplastic kidney in children.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 1999 and September 2005, 16 girls with a
mean age of 6.2 years (range: 2-15 years) presented with urinary incontinence
accompanied by regular voiding since birth (15 patients) and vaginitis (one
patient). Ultrasonography, intravenous urography and a 99mTc-DMSA renal scan
showed the presence of only a single kidney in all cases. Computed tomography
(CT) showed a dysplastic kidney definitely in nine patients, structures
suspicious of dysplastic kidney in three cases, and no dysplastic kidney in four 
cases. Magnetic resonance imaging was carried out in the four cases with
non-visualized dysplastic kidneys by CT, and showed a suspicious lesion in only
one case, and no lesion in the other three patients. All patients underwent
transperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy for a dysplastic kidney.
RESULTS: Laparoscopy identifies all dysplastic kidneys easily, even in those
cases in which dystrophic kidney could not be identified by preoperative imaging.
Dysplastic kidneys and ectopic ureters were removed successfully in all 16
patients. Mean operative time was 109 min (range: 40-155 min) with little
intraoperative bleeding. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 2.6 days (range:
2-4 days). No intraoperative complication was encountered, except in one single
case, in which a small bowel injury occurred during open Hasson's procedure. All 
patients became dry soon after the operation.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic nephrectomy for an ectopic ureter draining into a
dysplastic kidney is a safe and effective method, and can be carried out
successfully, despite a failure by preoperative imaging studies to localize the
dysplastic kidney.

Ankara, Turkey.

Owing to their minimally invasive nature, efficiency and availability,
radionuclide renal diagnostic studies play an important role in assessing renal
transplant function. Various quantitative parameters have been derived from the
radionuclide renograms in the follow-up to assess changes in perfusion and
function of the transplant kidneys. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
changes in renal transplants with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid
scintigraphy. Serial cortical renal scans of 66 patients were reviewed
retrospectively. The studies were analyzed regarding the quality of the images
and morphology of the kidneys. Cortical renal scintigraphy was unable to provide 
decisive information for the etiological diagnosis of renal graft dysfunction,
thus not allowing a distinction to be made between different clinical situations.
Despite being non-specific, it gives information that is not apparent on
conventional imaging as well as the extent of pathology, which makes it a
sensitive test in the follow-up of transplant pediatric patients. An early scan
within the first weeks provides a baseline, which may help in the assessment of
future complications.

the treatment of mild to moderately lead intoxicated mice.

The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic efficacies of combined use
of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) with calcium and ascorbic acid in the 
treatment of mild to moderately lead-intoxicated mice. Female albino mice were
exposed to lead by drinking water contaminated with 0.1% (moderate lead exposure)
or 0.05% (mild lead exposure) lead acetate. After the cessation of lead exposure,
mice were supplemented by gavage with saline solution, 50 mg/kg body weight (b.w)
DMSA, 100 mg/kg b.w DMSA, calcium and ascorbic acid, or 50 mg/kg b.w DMSA and
calcium as well as ascorbic acid, respectively. Atomic absorption
spectrophotometric method was used to analyze lead levels in blood, bone, liver, 
kidney and brain. Activities of blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase
(ALAD) were determined by colorimetric method. DMSA supplemented alone could
reduce lead levels in both soft tissues and bone and reverse lead-inhibited
activities of blood ALAD in mild to moderately lead-intoxicated mice. On the
other hand, combined use of DMSA with calcium and ascorbic acid achieved better
therapeutic efficacies in mobilizing lead in blood, liver and kidney, and
reversing lead-inhibited activities of blood ALAD in moderately lead intoxicated 
mice than DMSA supplemented alone. Moreover, the better therapeutic efficacies
were also found in mildly lead intoxicated mice in mobilizing lead in blood and
bone achieved by combined use of DMSA with calcium and ascorbic acid. Combined
use of DMSA with calcium and ascorbic acid seems to be the better choice in the
treatment of mild to moderate lead-intoxication.

Maghemite nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesized by chemical coprecipitation and
coated with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (HOOC-CH(SH)-CH(SH)-COOH or DMSA).
The morphology and properties of the nanoparticles were characterized by TEM,
XRD, Zeta Potential Analyzer and VSM. Subsequentially, the anti-human cardiac
troponin I (cTnI) immunomagnetic nanoparticles (IMNPs) were prepared by grafting 
anti-human cTnI antibodies on the surface of DMSA-coated MNPs using the linker of
EDC (1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride). The
conjugation amount of the antibodies and the activity of IMNPs was evaluated by
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. The results show 
that the physical and chemical adsorption occurred at the same time, but the
former was unstable and apt to desorb, and the maximum conjugation amount of
antibody was about 96 microg on the 0.1 mg MNPs by covalent bond. The stability
was also investigated, and after 300 days the antibodies on the IMNPs remained
the biological activity.

In a retrospective analysis we studied the case histories of 31 children who had 
been seen in our department for investigation of pelvic ectopic kidney between
January 1994 and June 2005. The evaluation of each involved the medical history, 
ultrasound examination, VCUG, and DMSA scan or MAG3 diuresis renogram. Of the 31 
children, 21 (67.7%) had initially been referred to our department for further
investigation and clarification because renal agenesis was suspected. In the
remaining 10 (32.3%) children the pelvic kidney was an incidental finding
observed during investigation of various other conditions. Overall, 7 (22.6%) of 
the 31 were symptomatic (recurrent urinary tract infections, abdominal pain,
hypertension, hydronephrosis), while 77.4% (24/31) were completely free of
symptoms at the time of follow-up. Ultrasound revealed that the ectopic kidney
was on the left in 64.5% (20/31) of these cases. Nuclear scans performed both at 
the time of the initial diagnosis and at follow-up were available for 11 of the
31 children and showed a mild improvement of the partial function of the pelvic
kidney, from a mean of 25.6% to a mean of 34.6%. In conclusion, whenever renal
agenesis is suspected on ultrasonographic examination, the investigator should
first consider renal ectopia; ultrasound examination with the bladder full is the
definitive diagnostic procedure. For asymptomatic cases we recommend regular
ultrasound monitoring of the kidney -- at first every 6 months and later once a
year. In cases with complex anatomy MRI is a suitable method for further
diagnostic work-up.

DnaK plays a pivotal role in Tat targeting of CueO and functions beside SlyD as a
general Tat signal binding chaperone.

The Tat (twin-arginine translocation) system from Escherichia coli transports
folded proteins with N-terminal twin-arginine signal peptides across the
cytoplasmic membrane. The influence of general chaperones on Tat substrate
targeting has not been clarified so far. Here we show that the chaperones SlyD
and DnaK bind to a broad range of different Tat signal sequences in vitro and in 
vivo. Initially, SlyD and GroEL were purified from DnaK-deficient extracts by
their affinity to various Tat signal sequences. Of these, only SlyD bound Tat
signal sequences also in the presence of DnaK. SlyD and DnaK also co-purified
with Tat substrate precursors, demonstrating the binding to Tat signal sequences 
in vivo. Deletion of dnaK completely abolished Tat-dependent translocation of
CueO, but not of DmsA, YcdB, or HiPIP, indicating that DnaK has an essential role
specifically for CueO. DnaK was not required for stability of the CueO precursor 
and thus served in some essential step after folding. A CueO signal sequence
fusion to HiPIP was Tat-dependently transported without the need of DnaK,
indicating that the mature domain of CueO is responsible for the DnaK dependence.
The overall results suggest that SlyD and DnaK are in the set of chaperones that 
can serve as general Tat signal-binding proteins. DnaK has additional functions
that are indispensable for the targeting of CueO.

Pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-(V)DMSA) is a
tumor-seeking agent which was introduced to evaluate, image, and manage many
types of cancers. In this review, the beginning of, and the most recent
applications of using this agent was appraised. The relation with tumor cell
detection and proliferation was reported and several mechanisms of uptake of
(99m)Tc-(V)DMSA in tumor cells are described.

Gujarat, India.

We compared the therapeutic efficacy of captopril and a thiol chelating agent,
meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) either individually or in combination
against arsenite induced oxidative stress and mobilization of metal in rats.
Animals were exposed to 100 ppm arsenite as sodium arsenite in drinking water for
six weeks followed by treatment with DMSA (50 mg/kg, orally), captopril (50
mg/kg, intraperitoneally) either alone or in combination, once daily for 5
consecutive days. Arsenite exposure led to a significant depletion of blood
delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity, glutathione and platelet
levels while significantly increased the level of reactive oxygen species (in
RBCs). Hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) level showed a significant decrease
while, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels increased on
arsenite exposure indicating arsenite induced hepatic oxidative stress. Kidney
GSH, GSSG, catalase and TBARS remained unchanged on arsenite exposure. Treatment 
with DMSA was effective in increasing ALAD activity while, captopril was
ineffective when given alone. Captopril when co-administered with DMSA also
provided no additional beneficial effect on blood ALAD activity but significant
brought altered platelet counts back to the normal value. In contrast,
administration of captopril alone provided significant beneficial effects on
hepatic oxidative stress, and in combination with DMSA provided a more pronounced
recovery in the TBARS level compared to the individual effect of DMSA and
captopril. Renal biochemical variables remained insensitive to arsenite and any
of the treatments. Interestingly, combined administration of captopril with DMSA 
had a remarkable effect in depleting total arsenic concentration from blood and
soft tissues. These results lead us to conclude that captopril administration
during chelation treatment had some beneficial effects particularly on the
protection of inhibited blood ALAD activity, and depletion of arsenic level. The 
study supports our earlier conclusion that a co-administration of an antioxidant 
is more beneficial than monotherapy with the chelating agents, in order to
achieve optimal effects of chelation in arsenite toxicity.

Does a normal DMSA obviate the performance of voiding cystourethrography in
evaluation of young children after their first urinary tract infection?

Tseng MH(1), Lin WJ, Lo WT, Wang SR, Chu ML, Wang CC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense
Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a normal technetium-99m-labeled
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan obviates the need for voiding
cystourethrography (VCUG) in evaluating young children after their first urinary 
tract infection (UTI).
STUDY DESIGN: This was a 10-year retrospective review of 142 children (age < or =
2 years, 77 boys and 65 girls) who had their first UTI and were admitted to a
tertiary care general hospital. The association between DMSA renal scan results
and VCUG results performed 48 hours and 1 month after diagnosis was evaluated.
RESULTS: DMSA renal scans and VCUG were performed in 142 patients. Of these, 99
patients (69.7%) had evidence of pyelonephritis, although only 2 (1.4%) had
evidence of renal scarring; 42 (29.6%) had vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on VCUG.
The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and
likelihood ratio negative for abnormalities on DMSA renal scans for detecting the
the presence of VUR on VCUG were 88% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 73% to
100%), 36% (95% CI = 26% to 46%), 37% (95% CI = 27% to 46%), 88 % (95% CI = 73%
to 100%), and 0.33 (95% CI = 0 to 0.88), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with a negative DMSA renal scan during their first UTI
episode rarely have VUR and may never have high-grade VUR. Avoiding VCUGs in
children with negative DMSA renal scans could significantly reduce the use of
this potentially traumatic test.

    Eur Urol. 2007 Sep;52(3):789-90.

OBJECTIVES: To compare changes in renal function following nephron-sparing
surgery (NSS) using tissue adhesive only versus NSS using standard suturing
technique, as measured by quantitative SPECT of 99m Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
uptake by the kidney (QDMSA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: QDMSA was done before and 3-6 mo after the operation in 32
patients who underwent standard suturing technique and in 24 patients in whom
tissue adhesive sealant (19 with albumin glutaraldehyde tissue adhesive
[BioGlue]; 5 with CoSeal) was used to close the parenchymal defect. Individual
kidney uptake was measured and retrospectively compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Average tumor diameter was 3.4cm (range: 2.2-6) in the suture group and 
3.56 (range: 1.7-6) in the tissue sealant group. In the tissue sealant group
following surgery, we observed an average individual renal function loss of
11.49% compared with the suture group in whom an average individual renal
function loss of 20.36% (p = 0.02) was measured by 99m Tc-DMSA.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of tissue sealant to close the parenchymal defect during NSS
demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in reducing functioning renal 
loss as measured by the absolute uptake of QDMSA. Further clinical studies are
required to establish the role of tissue sealants in NSS.

Cadmium inhibits delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase from rat lung in vitro:
interaction with chelating and antioxidant agents.

Luchese C(1), Zeni G, Rocha JB, Nogueira CW, Santos FW.

Author information:

Federal de Santa Maria, Santa Maria, CEP 97105-900, RS, Brazil.

The effect of cadmium (Cd(2+)) on delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (delta-ALA-D)
activity from rat lung in vitro was investigated. delta-ALA-D activity, a
parameter for metal intoxication, has been reported as a target of Cd(2+) in
different tissues. The protective effect of monotherapies with dithiol chelating 
(meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic
acid (DMPS)) or antioxidant agents (ascorbic acid, diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)(2),
and N-acetylcysteine (NAC)) was evaluated. The effect of a combined therapy
(dithiol chelatingxantioxidant agent) was also studied. Zinc chloride (ZnCl(2))
and dithiothreitol (DTT) were used to investigate the mechanisms involved in
cadmium, chelating and antioxidant effects on delta-ALA-D activity. Cadmium
inhibited rat lung delta-ALA-D activity at low concentrations. DTT (3mM), but not
ZnCl(2) (100microM), protected the inhibition of enzyme activity caused by
Cd(2+). Chelating agents were not effective in restoring the enzyme activity.
DMPS and DMSA presented inhibitory effect on enzyme activity. DTT restored the
inhibition caused by both chelating agents, but ZnCl(2) restored only the
inhibitory effect induced by DMSA. These compounds caused a marked potentiation
of delta-ALA-D inhibition induced by Cd(2+). ZnCl(2) did not restore inhibition
of enzyme activity caused by Cd(2+) plus chelating agents. Conversely, DTT
restored the inhibition induced by Cd(2+)/DMSA, but not by Cd(2+)/DMPS.
Antioxidants were not effective in ameliorating delta-ALA-D inhibition induced by
Cd(2+), whereas ascorbic acid potentiated the enzyme inhibition induced by this
metal. A combined effect of Cd(2+)xDMPSx(PhSe)(2) and Cd(2+)xDMPSxNAC was
observed. There was no combined effect of Cd(2+)xchelatorxantioxidants when DMSA 
was used. This study demonstrated that Cd(2+)inhibited delta-ALA-D activity and
chelating and antioxidant agents, alone or combined, did not restore the enzyme
activity. In contrast, these compounds potentiated the inhibition induced by
Cd(2+) in rat lung.

A clinical trial of combined anti-androgen and anti-heavy metal therapy in
autistic disorders.

Geier DA(1), Geier MR.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Chronic Illnesses, Silver Spring, MD 20905, USA.

BACKGROUND: A medical hypothesis has suggested that some autism spectrum
disorders (ASDs) may result from interactions between the methionine
cycle-transsulfuration and androgen pathways following exposure to mercury.
METHODS: The IRB of the Institute for Chronic Illnesses approved the present
study. A novel treatment was utilized combining LUPRON (leuprolide acetate, TAP
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and CHEMET (meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid--DMSA,
McNeil Consumer Products Company) on 11 consecutive children with ASDs.
RESULTS: A significant (p<0.01) overall improvement from the 70-79th percentile
of severity (median baseline score=87) at baseline to the 40-49th percentile of
severity (median end of study period score=63) at the end of the study was
observed for patients treated for a median of approximately 4 months. Significant
improvements in sociability, cognitive awareness, behavior, and clinical
symptoms/behaviors of hyperandrogenemia were also observed. Significant decreases
in blood androgens and increases in urinary heavy metal concentrations were
observed. Minimal drug adverse effects were found.
CONCLUSION: This study provides the first clinical evidence for the benefit that 
combined anti-androgen and anti-heavy metal therapy may have on some children
with ASDs. Additional studies should examine androgen and heavy metal mechanisms 
of action in ASDs, and future ASD treatment protocols should consider androgens
and heavy metals.

OBJECTIVE: Paediatric patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) have risk of
developing renal scarrings. Although it is known that vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)
predisposes to UTIs and it seems to have an important role in the development of 
renal lesions, some recent published studies question that relation. The aim of
the study was to evaluate renal scarring by using renal scintigraphy 99mTc-DMSA
and see the relation with or without the presence of VUR.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated retrospectively a total of 230 patients (460
renal units), mean age: 11 months (range: 12d-5y), with UTI probed by
urinoculture. All were studied with voiding cistourethrography (MCU) to evaluate 
the presence or absence of VUR. Patients were evaluated with 99mTc-DMSA scan 6
months after UTI to determine if UTI caused renal scarring.
RESULTS: Renal scans with 99mTc-DMSA 6 months post-infection were abnormal in 62 
renal units, affecting 54 patients (23 %). From all patients studied, 110 were
diagnosis of VUR being affected 161 renal units, 43 of them (27 %) presented
renal scarrings. From the remaining 120 patients without VUR that is 240 renal
units, 19 of them (8 %) presented parenchymatous damage.
CONCLUSION: Renal scarring resulting from UTI are in some cases related to VUR,
but sometimes are caused by the infection itself. Not all patients with VUR
develop renal lesions, and neither the presence of VUR always predispose children
to renal lesions. MCU and direct isotopic cystography are useful for diagnosis of
VUR but we shouldn't avoid 99mTc-DMSA scan in the management of children with
UTI.

BACKGROUND: The ideal time for distinguishing a renal scar from acute
inflammatory lesions by renal DMSA scintigraphy remains controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the time needed for resolution of lesions after acute
pyelonephritis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 105 children with acute pyelonephritis
underwent renal sonography, voiding cystourethrography and baseline DMSA
scintigraphy. Two subsequent scans were performed during the 6th and 12th months 
in patients with abnormal findings on the previous scan.
RESULTS: The baseline DMSA scintigraphy revealed cortical lesions in 37 patients.
At 6 months, 13 patients (38.2%) were found to have cortical lesions. At 12
months, 6 patients (17.6%) were found to have persistent renal cortical lesions. 
The resolution rates for lesions detected on the first scan were 61.8% and 82.4% 
on the 6- and 12-month scans, respectively. Vesicoureteric reflux, and
bilaterality or multifocality were not relevant for resolution of lesions. Female
gender seemed to be associated with a higher persistence rate.
CONCLUSIONS: The renal cortical defects present at 6 months have a high rate of
resolution later during follow-up. DMSA scintigraphy performed 12 months after
the infection provides more reliable data regarding persistence of renal cortical
lesions.

(1)Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Medical
College, Tainan, 70421, Taiwan.

To assess renal inflammation and its sequelae in Kawasaki disease (KD) patients, 
we conducted a prospective study in a university medical center setting in
Taiwan. From June 2002 to January 2005, 50 children with KD were enrolled, and
after admission, all received technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy
single photon emission computed tomography (DMSA renal SPECT), the results of
which were used as the reference standard for determining renal inflammation.
Patients with renal inflammation underwent another DMSA renal SPECT more than 6
months later to evaluate the sequelae. We found that 26 of the 50 patients (52%) 
had renal inflammatory foci. There were no significant relationships between
clinical or laboratory parameters and renal involvement in KD, except the
presence of coronary artery lesions [P<0.01; odds ratio (OR) 5.18; 95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.52-17.65]. Although all patients were free of clinical symptoms, 
the 6-month follow-up DMSA renal SPECT showed renal scarring in 11 of the 24
patients (46%). Patients with an initial abnormal renal ultrasound did predict a 
greatly increased risk of scarring (P<0.05; OR 16.2; 95% CI 1.27-206.20). In
conclusion, this study demonstrated that the potential long-term clinical impact 
of KD is not limited to coronary artery lesion sequelae but also includes renal
scar formation.

PURPOSE: In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) using radiolabelled
somatostatin analogues, the kidneys are the major dose-limiting organs, because
of tubular reabsorption and retention of radioactivity. Preventing renal uptake
or toxicity will allow for higher tumour radiation doses. We tested the
cytoprotective drug amifostine, which selectively protects healthy tissue during 
chemo- and radiotherapy, for its renoprotective capacities after PRRT with
high-dose [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate.
METHODS: Male Lewis rats were injected with 278 or 555 MBq
[(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate to create renal damage and were followed up
for 130 days. For renoprotection, rats received either amifostine or co-injection
with lysine. Kidneys, blood and urine were collected for toxicity measurements.
At 130 days after PRRT, a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan
was performed to quantify tubular uptake of (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA), a measure of tubular function.
RESULTS: Treatment with 555 MBq [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate resulted in
body weight loss, elevated creatinine and proteinuria. Amifostine and lysine
treatment significantly prevented this rise in creatinine and the level of
proteinuria, but did not improve the histological damage. In contrast, after 278 
MBq [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate, creatinine values were slightly, but not 
significantly, elevated compared with the control rats. Proteinuria and
histological damage were different from controls and were significantly improved 
by amifostine treatment. Quantification of (99m)Tc-DMSA SPECT scintigrams at 130 
days after [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate therapy correlated well with
1/creatinine (r(2)=0.772, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Amifostine and lysine effectively decreased functional renal damage
caused by high-dose [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate. Besides lysine,
amifostine might be used in clinical PRRT as well as to maximise anti-tumour
efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Patients with compensated Child-A cirrhosis have sub clinical
hypovolemia and diuretic treatment could result in renal impairment.
AIM: To evaluate the changes in renal functional mass as reflected by DMSA uptake
after single injection of intravenous furosemide in patients with compensated
liver cirrhosis.
METHODS: Eighteen cirrhotic patients were divided in two groups; eight patients
(group 1, age 56 +/- 9.6 yrs, Gender 5M/3F, 3 alcoholic and 5 non alcoholic) were
given low intravenous 40 mg furosemide and ten other patients (group 2, age 54
+/- 9.9, Gender 6M/4F, 4 alcoholic and 6 non alcoholic) were given high 120 mg
furosemide respectively. Renoscintigraphy with 100MBq Of Tc 99 DMSA was given
intravenously before and 90 minutes after furosemide administration and SPECT
imaging was determined 3 hours later. All patients were kept under low sodium
diet (80mEq/d) and all diuretics were withdrawn for 3 days. 8-hours UNa exertion,
Calculated and measured Creatinine clearance (CCT) were performed for all
patients.
RESULTS: Intravenous furosemide increased the mean renal DMSA uptake in 55% of
patients with compensated cirrhosis and these changes persist up to three hours
after injection. This increase was at the same extent in either low or high doses
of furosemide. (From 12.8% +/- 3.8 to 15.2% +/- 2.2, p < 0.001 in Gr I as
compared to 10.6% +/- 4.6 to 13.5% +/- 3.6 in Gr 2, p < 0.001). In 8 patients
(45%, 3 pts from Gr 1 and 5 pts from Gr 2) DMSA uptake remain unchanged. The mean
8 hrs UNa excretion after intravenous furosemide was above 80 meq/l and was
higher in Gr 2 as compared to Gr 1 respectively (136 +/- 37 meq/l) VS 100 +/-
36.6 meq/l, P = 0.05). Finally, basal global renal DMSA uptake was decreased in
80% of patients; 22.5 +/- 7.5% (NL > 40%), as compared to normal calculated
creatinine clearance (CCT 101 +/- 26), and measured CCT of 87 +/- 30 cc/min (P < 
0.001).
CONCLUSION: A single furosemide injection increases renal functional mass as
reflected by DMSA in 55% of patients with compensated cirrhosis and identify 45% 
of patients with reduced uptake and who could develop renal impairment under
diuretics. Whether or not albumin infusion exerts beneficial effect in those
patients with reduced DMSA uptake remains to be determined.

Nagar-110029, New Delhi, India.

We present a case history of a 24 years old male who developed autonomic
dysfunction, intestinal pseudo-obstruction and anemia due to lead poisoning.
Concomitant recording of blood levels of lead and autonomic function showed a
gradual decline in blood lead level (98.8 microg/dL at week 0, 56 microg/dL at
week 6, and 40 microg/dL at week 52) and gradual improvement in autonomic
functions. Decrease in blood lead levels with DMSA (Meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic 
acid) therapy showed improvement in autonomic functions. At week 0, the patient
had severe loss of autonomic tone and autonomic reactivity which improved at week
6. At the 52nd week, most of the autonomic parameters had normalized except for
the persistence of mild loss of parasympathetic reactivity.

In a 62-year-old man with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, a postoperative
Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid [(V) DMSA] study was requested. In the Tc-99m (V) 
DMSA scan. no abnormalities, indicating local recurrence or metastatic disease,
were observed. However, there was increased uptake in the spleen and liver and
significantly diffusely increased uptake in the bone marrow. The patient also had
a history of myelofibrosis and these findings appear to have been the result of
this pathology.

Response of arsenic-induced oxidative stress, DNA damage, and metal imbalance to 
combined administration of DMSA and monoisoamyl-DMSA during chronic arsenic
poisoning in rats.

Bhadauria S(1), Flora SJ.

Arsenic and its compounds cause adverse health effects in humans. Current
treatment employs administration of thiol chelators, such as
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropane
1-sulfonate (DMPS), which facilitate its excretion from the body. However, these 
chelating agents are compromised by number of limitations due to their lipophobic
nature, particularly in case of chronic poisoning. Combination therapy is a new
approach to ensure enhanced removal of metal from the body, reduced doses of
potentially toxic chelators, and no redistribution of metal from one organ to
another, following chronic metal exposure. The present study attempts to
investigate dose-related effects of two thiol chelators, DMSA and one of its new 
analogues, monoisoamyl dimercaptosuccinic acid (MiADMSA), when administered in
combination with the aim of achieving normalization of altered biochemical
parameters suggestive of oxidative stress and depletion of inorganic arsenic
following chronic arsenic exposure. Twenty-five adult male Wistar rats were given
25 ppm arsenic for 10 weeks followed by chelation therapy with the above
chelating agents at a dose of 0.3 mmol/kg (orally) when administered individually
or 0.15 mmol/kg and 0.3 mmol/kg (once daily for 5 consecutive days),
respectively, when administered in combination. Arsenic exposure led to the
inhibition of blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity and
depletion of glutathione (GSH) level. These changes were accompanied by
significant depletion of hemoglobin, RBC and Hct as well as blood superoxide
dismutase (SOD) acitivity. There was an increase in hepatic and renal levels of
thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, while GSH:GSSG ratio decreased
significantly, accompanied by a significant increase in metallothionein (MT) in
hepatocytes. DNA damage based on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
revealed significant loss in the integrity of DNA extracted from the liver of
arsenic-exposed rats compared to that of normal animals. These changes were
accompanied by a significant elevation in blood and soft-tissue arsenic
concentration. Co-administration of DMSA and MiADMSA at lower dose (0.15 mmol/kg)
was most effective not only in reducing arsenic-induced oxidative stress but also
in depleting arsenic from blood and soft tissues compared to other treatments.
This combination was also able to repair DNA damage caused following arsenic
exposure. We thus recommend combined administration of DMSA and MiADMSA for
achieving optimum effects of chelation therapy.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Experimental Diagnostic Imaging, The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Unit 57, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to label the versatile
amino acid l-lysine with (99m)Tc using 2,3-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) as a
chelator, and to assess its tumor imaging feasibility under in vivo and in vitro 
conditions, and finally to determine the subcellular biodistribution of this
radiopharmaceutical.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DMSA-l-lysine was chemically synthesized and labeled with 
sodium pertechnetate. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectral analysis
of DMSA-l-lysine were conducted. Radiochemical purity was determined by
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and paper chromatography. Cellular uptake,
competition and subcellular localization studies were performed in rat breast
cancer cells (13762). In vivo studies of planar imaging and biodistribution
studies were performed on female Fischer 344 rats. Medical Internal Radiation
Dose (MIRD) dosimetry estimates were calculated.
RESULTS: Radiochemical purity (determined by radio-TLC and high-performance
liquid chromatography) of these compounds was >95%. (99m)Tc-DMSA-l-lysine showed 
good uptake in in vitro cell culture assays and uptake was reduced in competition
studies. (99m)Tc-DMSA-l-lysine accumulates in the nucleus as much as in the
cytoplasm and it was also shown that accumulation of the (99m)Tc-DMSA-l-lysine in
the nucleus increases as a function of a time. There was an increase in
tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle count density ratios. Tumor/background ratios 
were 5.75 at 1 hour and 6.87 at 2 hours. In vivo tissue distribution studies
revealed that radiation dosimetry of blood-forming organs were within radiation
dose limits.
CONCLUSION: DMSA-l-lysine kits can be labeled with (99m)Tc easily and
efficiently, with high radiochemical purity and cost-effectiveness. In vitro
cellular uptake and scintigraphic imaging studies demonstrated the
pharmacokinetic distribution and feasibility of using (99m)Tc-DMSA-l-lysine for
tumor imaging.

OBJECTIVE: Assess the relation of age and sex in vesico ureteral reflux (VUR) and
renal scarring and the relation of VUR and renal scarring in childhood urinary
tract infection.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A descriptive study of one hundred and twenty-six children
who received renal cortical scintigraphy from 1st Jan 2000 to 31st Dec 2004 in
the Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, was conducted.
Ninety-three (50 males, 43 females) patients were diagnosed with urinary tract
infections (UTIs) but only ninety-one of them had renal cortical scintigraphic
results available. The male to female ratio was 1.16:1. The mean age of the
patients was 4.33 years (SD +/- 4.17, range 7 days-16 years). During the 1st year
of life the male to female ratio is 2.6:1. Fever, dysuria, and poor feeding were 
the most presenting signs and symptoms. Eighty-five (45 males, 40 females)
patients received Voiding Cysto Urethro Gram (VCUG).
RESULT: The authors did not find the correlation between the age groups and sex
with VCUG results on right and left side, respectively (p = 0.856, p = 0.145, p =
0.77, p = 0.75). Ninety-one (49 males, 42 females) patients received DMSA renal
scintigraphy. Fifty-two patients (57.1%) had abnormal DMSA renal scan results.
However; the authors did not find the correlation between age groups and sex with
DMSA renal scan results on the right and left kidneys, respectively. (p = 0.202, 
p = 0.416, p = 0.511, p = 0.791). The authors compared times of UTIs with and
DMSA renal scintigraphy in each side of the kidney. Even though the authors did
find the correlation between episodes of UTIs and abnormal DMSA on the left
kidneys (p = 0.017), it was not found on the right kidneys (p = 0.081). There
were 80 patients who received both VCUG and DMSA renal scintigraphy. The authors 
found the correlation between severity of VUR and abnormal DMSA results on right 
and left kidneys (p = 0.001, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The authors recommend that all children who have repeated UTI and/or 
VUR, irrespective of age and sex, should receive DMSA renal scintigraphy to
detect renal scarring and follow up future complications.

Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. m_basiratnia@yahoo.com

Urinary tract infection is common in children. The available gold standard
methods for diagnosis, Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and computed
tomography (CT) are invasive and expensive. This study was performed to assess
the role of power Doppler ultrasound (PDU) for diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis 
(APN) compared with Tc-99m DMSA scan. A prospective study was conducted in 34
children with the mean age of 2.8+/-2.7 years who were hospitalized with the
first episode of febrile urinary tract infection. All children were examined in
the first 3 days of admission by PDU and Tc-99m DMSA scan. Patients with
congenital structural anomaly were excluded. Each kidney was divided into three
zones. The comparison between PDU and DMSA scan was performed on the basis of
patients and renal units. According to the patient's number, sensitivity,
specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of PDU were
89%, 53%, 70%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, but based on the renal units, changed 
to 66%, 81%, 46%, 91%, and 79%, respectively. Although PDU has the potential for 
identifying APN in children, it is still soon to replace DMSA scan.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate whether breast uptake of (99m)Tc-(V)DMSA and
(99m)Tc-sestamibi in usual ductal epithelial breast hyperplasia (UDH) and
apocrine metaplasia is related to cell proliferation rate (Ki-67) and oestrogen
receptor (ER) expression, both of which are associated with the potential risk of
evolving to malignancy.
METHODS: Among patients referred for suspicious breast findings on palpation
and/or mammography and evaluated preoperatively with both radiopharmaceuticals,
we retrospectively studied 17 (10 with UDH: group I; and seven with apocrine
metaplasia: group II). Lesion-to-background (L/B) ratios in early and late
acquisitions were calculated for both radiotracers in both groups, as well as
their retention ratios. Ki-67 and oestrogen receptor expression were determined
immunohistochemically. The late L/B ratios between the two tracers were compared,
as were the late ratios for each tracer between Ki-67 < or = 3% and > 3%, and
between ER < or = 15% and > 15%. Linear regression analysis was also performed
between L/B and retention ratios and Ki-67 expression.
RESULTS: There was a significant increase of the (99m)Tc-(V)DMSA L/B ratio in
late images as compared to the early images in group I (P<0.05), while in group
II it was not significantly increased (P=0.084). (99m)Tc-sestamibi ratios did not
demonstrate variability over time in either group (P=0.156 and 0.274,
respectively). Significant coefficient correlation was found between the
(99m)Tc-(V)DMSA L/B(late) ratios and retention ratios and Ki-67 levels only for
group I (r=0.889, P<0.001 and r=0.802, P<0.01, respectively). The (99m)Tc-(V)DMSA
L/B(late) ratios in group I were significantly higher when Ki-67 > 3% than when
Ki-67 < or = 3% (P=0.016) but did not differ considerably between ER > 15% and < 
or = 15% (P=0.732).
CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-(V)DMSA uptake in UDH correlates with Ki-67 expression. This 
could prove useful in identifying women with benign but high-risk breast
pathologies who might benefit from chemoprophylaxis.

Positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) in the detection of medullary thyroid
carcinoma metastases.

Author information:

University, Lodz. mucha.sla@wp.pl

INTRODUCTION: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is usually more advanced at
presentation than differentiated thyroid cancers and often has distant
metastases. The primary treatment of MTC is total thyroidectomy and regional
lymph node dissection. The efficacy of these procedures has been limited by the
aggressiveness of the disease and metastatic spread at the time of surgery.
Persistently elevated levels of calcitonin (CT) and carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA) or their increase postoperatively are indicative for residual or recurrent 
disease. Conventional imaging methods such as ultrasonography, computed
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and MIBI scintigraphy usually fail to find
the source of calcitonin. Better imaging properties have been shown by DMSA
scintigraphy, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy or by positron emission
tomography (PET). The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of
PET for the localisation of occult MTC in patients after surgery with increased
concentrations of CT, in whom conventional imaging procedures have not been
successful.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The PET investigation using (18)F-fluoro- 2-deoxy-D-glucose
combined with computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET/CT) was performed at the
Department of Nuclear Medicine (Oncology Centre in Bydgoszcz) between January and
October 2004. In five patients with postoperative calcitonin ranging from 164 to 
> 2000 ng/l (normal < 10 ng/l) no tumour lesions were found using other imaging
methods.
RESULTS: In four of five cases, responsible lesions with a higher metabolism of
FDG, indicating MTC tissue (remnants or metastases), were localised. In one
patient no focus of FDG accumulation was found despite high CT concentration. PET
detected tumour manifestations in the neck and the mediastinum in two patients,
in the lung and the left adrenal gland in one case and in the neck and the liver 
in another patient. As a result of surgery for the removal of a residual tumour
or metastases the accuracy of diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology in all
four cases and a decrease in CT and CEA levels was observed in 3/4 cases. The
metabolic imaging findings by PET/CT ensured that the surgery on these patients
was successful.
CONCLUSIONS: For the detection of occult residual or metastatic MTC lesions,
(18)FDG-PET is a valuable procedure in imaging diagnostics.

INTRODUCTION: Recently a new somatostatin analogue labelled with (99m)Tc
((99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC) has been synthetized. Aim of this study was to evaluate the
utility of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC in the radionuclide imaging in patients with
medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 30 patients with MTC aged 22-83 years in different stages
of the disease were investigated. In 6 patients (group 1) scintigraphy was
performed before surgery directly after diagnosis of MTC. Four patients (group 2)
were qualified to the study in the phase of remission after surgical treatment
that had been confirmed by low concentrations of calcitonin. Twenty patients
(group 3) were investigated due to stagnation or recurrence confirmed by
persistent hypercalcitoninemia. The scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC
(Tektrotyd, POLATOM) was performed 2 and 4 hours post injection of 20 mCi (740
MBq) of the tracer. Other imaging techniques were also employed and analysed in
individual cases (US, CT, (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA, (131)I-MIBG, (99m)Tc-MDP,
(111)In-octreotide and FDG-PET).
RESULTS: Images obtained 2 and 4 hours p.i. were similar. In group 1, uptake of
the tracer was found in the primary tumour of MTC in all patients. In group 2, a 
false positive result was found in 1 of 6 patients. In the remaining 5 of 6 cases
no pathological foci were visualised. In group 3, uptake in the thyroid bed was
found in 3 of 20 cases and in the lymph nodes in 14 of 20 patients. In 3 of 20
cases uptake in the bone metastases was found. Globally, sensitivity of the
scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC was 86.4%, specificity - 75.0%, and accuracy
- 84.6%.
CONCLUSION: The scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC showed high utility in the
diagnosis of MTC. Confirmation of the presence of somatostatin receptors with
this method may be used for treatment planning: surgery or radionuclide therapy.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, 2500 University
Drive NW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 1N4.

Here we describe the biophysical characterization of the interaction of the redox
enzyme maturation protein DmsD with the signal peptide of its target protein,
DmsA. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), size exclusion chromatography
(SEC), and an in vitro Far-Western assay is used to show that DmsD binds the
twin-arginine signal peptide from DmsA in the micromolar range and in a 1:1 molar
ratio. The SEC also shows that there is no oligomerization upon binding. Urea and
guanidium hydrochloride denaturation profiles demonstrate the stability of DmsD
and give insights on how electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are important
within this binding process. Furthermore, by use of N- and C-terminal fusions of 
DmsA signal peptide to GST, we observe that N-terminal display of the peptide is 
important for binding DmsD. In addition, all the folding forms of DmsD were found
to bind the DmsA signal peptide as observed with the Far-Western assay.

In 2005, the Olive Leaf Wholeness Center conducted a demonstration project that
provided health assessment, testing, and treatment to 160 uniformed service
personnel and residents of Lower Manhattan who were exposed to the air at Ground 
Zero following September 11, 2001, for extended periods of time. The program,
known as Project Olive ReLeaf, found that most individuals had eight or more
serious health complaints, including severe respiratory problems, digestive
problems, skin rashes, sleeplessness, anxiety, depression, weight gains, elevated
blood pressure, lethargy, and recurrent headaches. Heavy metal toxicity was
suspected as a causal factor for many of these symptoms. Of those tested for
heavy metal toxicity, using a challenge urine test, 85% had excessively high
levels of lead and mercury. Chelation treatment using dimercaptuosuccinic acid
(DMSA), a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved sulfur compound, was the
primary treatment prescribed. After three to four months of treatment, the first 
cohort of 100 individuals reported significant (greater than 60%) improvement in 
all symptoms. (This demonstration program was developed based on the results of
an earlier pilot in 2003 for 25 emergency service officers of the New York City
Police Department.) In addition, adjunctive therapies to assist with the
detoxification process and build the immune system were offered. A small grant
has been received to conduct follow-up tests on a sample of those treated with
DMSA.

Paediatric 99mTc-DMSA imaging: Reducing distress and rate of sedation using a
psychological approach.

(1)St George's Hospital, London, UK.

AIM: To evaluate the effect of a psychological approach on distress and sedation 
rates in children undergoing dimer captosuccinic acid-labelled with technetium-99
(99mTc) DMSA imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baseline data, on a retrospective consecutive sample of
children examined using DMSA over a 6-month period (n = 81), were collected via
medical note search and postal questionnaire. A further consecutive sample of 40 
children was recruited prospectively to the intervention, which consisted of
distraction during medical procedures and environmental manipulation. In addition
half of the intervention group were provided with a photo-booklet depicting a
coping child model, together with a letter offering advice to parents on how to
prepare their child for the procedure.
RESULTS: Sedation rates were lower (p = 0.003) and service satisfaction ratings
higher (p = 0.002) in the Intervention group as compared with the Baseline group.
Within the intervention condition, children who received the photo-booklet
displayed less distress before the procedure (p = 0.01) than those who did not.
Also families who received the photo-booklet were more likely to attend the
appointment (p = 0.024).
CONCLUSION: In this study, the use of a psychological approach was associated
with lower rates of distress and sedation in children undergoing 99mTc-DMSA
imaging, without compromising image quality.

(1)Department of Neonatology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: Posterior urethral valves (PUV) are a common cause of lower urinary
tract obstruction. Renal failure occurs in approximately one third of the cases. 
It is debated whether urinoma formation is a protective mechanism to reduce
pressure-related impairment of renal function. The aim of our study was to
determine if urinoma formation is able to preserve renal function on the side of 
the urinoma.
METHODS: Five male patients diagnosed with posterior urethral valves and uni- or 
bilateral urinoma formation were reviewed. Renal function was assessed by serum
creatinine level at days 4-7 and at two months, in addition to
dimercaptosuccinylacid (DMSA) scintigraphy at 4-6 weeks postnatal age.
RESULTS: Impaired renal function occurred unilaterally in four patients, two had 
bilateral urinoma formation, and the other two boys presented with unilateral
urinoma, one with preserved renal function ipsilateral to the urinoma and the
other on the contralateral side. Urinary ascites was detected in three patients, 
all underwent antenatal centesis.
CONCLUSIONS: No association was found between renal function and urinoma
formation in patients with PUV.

Epidemiology, Health Public School, University of Sao Paulo, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, 
Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the renal function measured with 
either 99mTc-DTPA or 99mTc-EC dynamic scintigraphies with that measured using
99mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy.
METHODS: the values of relative renal function measured in 111 renal dynamic
scintigraphies performed either with 99mTc-DTPA (55 studies) or with 99mTc-EC (56
studies) were compared with the relative function measured using 99mTc-DMSA
static scintigraphy performed within a 1-month period. The comparisons were
performed using Wilcoxon signed rank test. The number of 99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-EC 
studies that presented relative renal function different by more than 5% from
that measured with 99mTc-DMSA, using chi square test were also compared.
RESULTS: the relative renal function measured with 99mTc-EC is not statistically 
different from that measured with 99mTc-DMSA (p = 0.97). The relative renal
function measured with 99mTc-DTPA was statistically different from that measured 
using 99mTc-DMSA, but with a borderline statistical significance (p = 0.05). The 
number of studies with relative renal function different by more than 5% from
that measured with 99mTc-DMSA is higher for the 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy (p =
0.04) than for 99mTc-EC.
CONCLUSION: the relative renal function measured with 99mTc-EC dynamic
scintigraphy is comparable with that measured with 99mTc-DMSA static
scintigraphy, while the relative renal function measured with 99mTc-DTPA dynamic 
scintigraphy presents a significant statistical difference from that measured
with 99mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy.

Urinary Tract Infection in Boys Less Than Five Years of Age: A General Pediatric 
Perspective.

Nadi HM(1), Shalan YA, Al-Qatan HY, Alotaibi S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Farwania Hospital, Kuwait.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the pattern of urinary tract infection (UTI) in boys < 5
years admitted to general pediatric wards and to identify the approach to imaging
investigations. DESIGN: During the period from January 2002 through December
2002, 34 boys < 5 years of age were admitted to Farwania Hospital with UTI. Age
at diagnosis, presenting features, urinalysis, pathogens, acute phase reactants
and imaging procedures were reviewed for these patients. RESULTS: All 34 patients
in this study were less than one year. Fever was the most common presenting
feature and was seen in 70.6% of patients. Pyuria was found in 77% , positive
leukocyte esterase (LE) test in 85.7% and positive nitrite test in 45.7% of
patients. Significant leukocytosis was found in 39.3%, high C-reactive protein
(CRP) in 46.8% and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 50% of children. 
Escherichia coli (E.coli) were the most common pathogen affecting 77.1% patients.
Radiological investigations were recommended as follows: ultrasound scan (US) for
all patients (94.2% did the test, 46.8% had normal scans and 43.7% had dilatation
of pelvicalyceal system); Early-scheduled (99m)Tc dimercaptosuccinic scan (DMSA) 
was done in seven patients. Five or 71% had evidence of acute pyelonephritis;
Late-scheduled DMSA was recommended for 25 patients. Only 52% did the test and
out of those 46% had evidence of chronic involvement of the kidney(s);
Micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) was advised for 32 patients. 43.8% failed to 
carry out the procedure. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was found in 38.8% of those 
who performed the test. CONCLUSION: Unexplained fever in young boys should
suggest UTI. Absence of fever does not exclude UTI, if other suggestive features 
exist particularly in the very young. UTI is commonly suggested by findings on
urinalysis, on the other hand, negative urinalysis should not exclude the
infection. Empiric antibiotics should cover gram-negative bacilli. Innovative
strategies to ensure compliance to radiological investigations are needed.

Calyceal plication with pyeloplasty in the treatment of giant hydronephrosis in
children.

Zupancić B(1), Popović L, Mikulić D, Vrtar Z, Fattorini I, Augustin G.

Author information:

The relief of obstruction alone is frequently not sufficient to ensure renal
salvage in giant hydronephrosis. We report on our experience with plication of
the renal calyces used as an adjunct to dismembered pyeloplasty in patients with 
giant hydronephrosis. We describe the operative technique and outcomes in ten
children after a follow-up period of six months. Ten patients (six girls and four
boys) with a mean age of 8.1 years (range 2-14 years) with giant hydronephrosis
caused by primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction underwent a dismembered
pyeloplasty followed by plication of the dilated renal calyces. The preoperative 
evaluation included an excretory urography, ultrasonography, 99mTc-DMSA and
99mTc-DTPA scans. The same tests were repeated six months after the operation to 
evaluate the outcomes. There were no intraoperative or postoperative
complications. Excretory urography and ultrasonography performed six months after
the operation demonstrated a significant improvement of the morphology of the
operated kidneys. The kidneys shrunk in diameter from a mean of 149.5 mm (range
89-224 mm) to 93.6 mm (range 68-121 mm) and the mean diameter of the calyces was 
reduced from 26.9 mm (range 15-42 mm) to 14.7 mm (range 10-24 mm). Renal
99mTc-DTPA scans showed improved perfusion and renal function after surgery, with
the mean elimination rate decreasing from 22.41 min (range 17.84 - 28.22 min) to 
11.7 min (range 8.16-13.76 mm). 99mTc-DMSA scans demonstrated no new scars and no
deterioration of renal parenchyma after surgery. We believe that plication of the
renal calyces is the method of choice to be used as an adjunct to the
Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty in the treatment of paediatric patients with giant
hydronephrosis.

Although the current production of oxide nanoparticles may be modest, the wide
range of proposed applications and forecasted growth in production has raised
questions about the potential impact of these nanoparticles on the environment
and human health. Iron oxide nanoparticles have been proposed for an increasing
number of biomedical applications although in vitro toxicity depending on the
particles coating has been evidenced. The aim of this study was to examine the
potential in vitro cyto- and genotoxicity on human dermal fibroblasts of
DMSA-coated maghemite nanoparticles (NmDMSA) as a function of well-defined
physicochemical states. Well-stabilized NmDMSA produced weak cytotoxic and no
genotoxic effects. This is attributed in part to the DMSA coating, which serves
as a barrier for a direct contact between nano-oxide and fibroblasts, inhibiting 
a potential toxic effect.

The aim of the study was to assess the rate of development of voiding dysfunction
(VD) in patients with reflux nephropathy. We investigated 150 pts with
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR): 33 boys and 117 girls in mean age 9 +/- 3.3 years
with normal renal function. In all pts we performed renal scintigraphy (DMSA) and
ABPM. Renal scarring by DMSA scan was categorized into grades 1-4. In all pts we 
assessed high and laterality of VUR, renal function (clearance creatinine--Ccr)
and occurency of hypertension (HT).RESULTS: Of 150 pts, 80 (53.3%) developed VD
(54.5% boys and 52% girls). DMSA grade: 1--27 pts, 2--85 pts; 3--31 pts; 4--7
pts. No statistically significant difference was found depends of: sex, age,
laterality of renal damage in DMSA, unilateral and bilateral reflux for the
development of VD. The incidence 3-4 grade in DMSA scan was significantly higher 
in pts with IV-V grade of VUR in comparison to pts with lower grade of VUR in
group with and without voiding dysfunction. IV-V grades of VUR were observed more
frequently in pts with bladder/sphincter dysfunction. The occurency of HT in
group with VD and without VD was 12 pts (15%) and 8 (11.4%) respectively (ns).
Pts with VD have lower Ccr in comparison with pts without VD (129.1 vs 136.3
ml/min/1.73 m2; p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 50% of patients with VUR demonstrated VD. VD occurred 
independent of age. IV-V degrees VUR and more severe changes in DMSA scan were
seen in pts with bladder/sphincter dysfunction.

Low birth weight (bw) has been related to low nephron number and hypertension.
Age is an important predictor of developing hypertension in patients with reflux 
nephropathy (RN). The aim of the study was to assess the relationships between
birth weight and blood pressure in children with RN. We investigated 150 patients
in mean age 9 +/- 3.3 years with vesicoureteral reflux. In all patients we
collected birth weight, we also performed renal scintigraphy (DMSA) and 24-hour
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Standard deviation score body mass
index (BMI SDS) was calculated. In ABPM mean value of systolic and diastolic
blood pressure (sBP, dBP), blood pressure load during 24 hour and during day and 
nighttime (LsBP, LdBP) were analyzed. As objective parameters of BP in children
in different age and hight, systolic and diastolic BP indices (sBPI, dBPI) were
calculated.RESULTS: In analyzed group of children mean bw was 3340 +/- 587 g
(from 1300 to 5000 g); in 10 children bw was <2500 g. In 20 children (13%), in 3 
with bw <2500 g (30%) and in 17 (12.5%) with normal bw hypertension was
diagnosed. The mean age and BMI SDS were lower in children with bw < 2500 g and
HT than in children with normal bw and HT (8.2 vs 9.9 years and median -0.53 vs
-0.22 respectively). In children with HT mean bw was 3247 +/- 666 g and in
children without HT 3293 +/- 461 g (NS). No statistically significant difference 
was found depends of grades of renal damage in DMSA scan for bw. The negative
correlation was found between bw and sBPI, LsBP during 24h and sBPI i LsBP during
nighttime (p<0.05 r=-20, p<0.05 r=-19; p<0.05 r=-16, p<0.01 r=-26 respectively). 
No correlation was found between bw and dBP values.
CONCLUSION: In children with RN low bw may be a potential risk factor for
developing hypertension independent of severity of renal scarring.

Diagnostic efficacy of technetium-99m pentavalent-dimercapto succinic acid versus
gallium-67 citrate, imaging in patients with highly suspected acute bone and
joint infections.

(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Heraklion, Crete, Greece. 
sophiak@her.forthnet.gr

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the diagnostic efficacy of 
(99m)Tc(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc(V)DMSA) with the (67)Ga-citrare
((67)Ga-C) scintigraphy in patients with suspected bone and joint infection.
Thirty one patients, 19 men and 12 women, aged 18-78 y with median age 56 y, with
suspected acute bone infection, were enrolled in this study. Besides (67)Ga-C and
(99m)Tc(V)DMSA scintigraphy, all patients underwent X-ray radiography and
technetium-99m methylene disphosphonate ((99m)Tc-MDP) bone scan for supporting
the initial diagnosis. The (99m)Tc-MDP bone scan was considered positive for
acute bone and joint infection when all its four scintigraphic phases were
positive. Final diagnosis was based on needle aspiration and/or biopsy findings. 
Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values (PPV 
and NPV) were calculated. Our results have shown the following: Seventeen
patients (17/31) had histologically confirmed acute bone and joint infections,
while the remaining patients had no infection. (99m)Tc(V)DMSA diagnosed bone and 
joint infections in all positive (17/31) patients while (67)Ga-C in 16/31
patients. Discordant scintigraphic results were observed by (67)Ga-C in 2/31
cases: in one positive case of femur postoperative infection (false negative for 
(67)Ga-C) and in one case of clinicaly suspected infection in the femur while the
patient had a preexisting fracture (false positive with (67)Ga-C). No false
negative results were observed with (99m)Tc(V)DMSA. Sensitivity, specificity,
PPV, NPV and accuracy were maximum for (99m)Tc(V)DMSA, while for (67)Ga-C were:
94.1%, 93%, 94.1%, 93%, and 93.5% respectively. It is concluded that considering 
the high sensitivity and specificity of (99m)Tc(V)DMSA in the detection of acute 
bone and joint infections, the lower radiation dose, the cost and the shorter
time spent for the imaging procedure, as compared to (67)Ga-C, (99m)Tc(V)DMSA
should be preferred to (67)Ga-C as a bone scan agent for the detection of acute
bone and joint infections.

Accurate diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis: How helpful is procalcitonin?

Güven AG(1), Kazdal HZ, Koyun M, Aydn F, Güngör F, Akman S, Baysal YE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatrics, Akdeniz University, School of Medicine, Antalya,
Turkey.

AIM: This prospective study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of serum
procalcitonin levels in children with acute pyelonephritis documented by
Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.
METHODS: We compared the symptoms and laboratory findings of fever, vomiting,
abdominal/flank pain, leukocyte count, serum C-reactive protein and procalcitonin
levels with the results of the DMSA scan obtained within the first 72 h after
referral in children who were diagnosed as having acute pyelonephritis.
Thirty-three children (31 female and two male) aged 1-11 years (mean 4.42 years) 
were enrolled in this prospective study.
RESULTS: Twenty-one of 33 patients (64%) had positive DMSA scans. On the scans
obtained after 6 months, five of 21 patients (23.8%) had renal scars. No
correlation was found between clinical and laboratory parameters, alone or
combined with each other, and positive DMSA scans. Serum procalcitonin levels
were 0.767+/-0.64 and 1.23+/-1.17 ng . ml in children with normal and positive
DMSA scans, respectively. The cut-off value for procalcitonin using receiver
operating characteristic analysis was 0.9605 ng . ml, while sensitivity and
specificity were 86.4% and 36.4%, respectively. However, if the cut-off value was
chosen as 2 ng . ml, the sensitivity increased to 100% while specificity did not 
change markedly.
CONCLUSION: The serum procalcitonin test, like other commonly used laboratory
parameters, e.g. serum C-reactive protein and white blood cell count, was
inadequate in distinguishing renal parenchymal involvement in acute febrile
urinary tract infections.

(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Firat University Medical Faculty, Elazig,
Turkey. tansel_balci@yahoo.com

We report a patient with DTPA and DMSA uptake on unsuspected bone metastases. He 
had severe pain due to grade 3 hydronephrosis of his left kidney. When Tc-99m
DTPA and DMSA renal scanning were performed for preoperative evaluation, abnormal
radiopharmaceutical uptake on the iliac area was noted. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma
metastases to bone were subsequently defined. This patient is a very
demonstrative case in respect of having all DTPA, DMSA and HDP uptakes in bone
metastases. The type of the tumor has to be added to the list of extrarenal
uptake of DTPA and DMSA as a rare cause.

- initial results.

There is considerable chemical and structural similarity between the widely used 
oncophilic substance pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid labeled with (99m)Tc
[(99m)Tc-DMSA(V)] and the renal imaging agent trivalent [(99m)Tc-DMSA(III)].
Other renal imaging agents like diethyltriamine penta acetic acid (DTPA) and
glucoheptonate labeled with (99m)Tc have been used for imaging brain lesions,
mainly for brain tumor imaging. The aim of this study was to evaluate technetium 
labeled (99m)Tc-DMSA(III) for brain tumor imaging. Single photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain with (99m)Tc-DMSA(III) was performed in 
twenty-three patients with brain tumors in recurrence and the results were
correlated with contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Ten 
patients had multiform blioblastoma, 7 patients had anaplastic astocystoma, 5
patients low grade glioma and 1 patient menengioma. Our results show that brain
SPECT was able to detect 20 of the 21 tumors detected by the contrast enhanced
MRI of the brain. The brain scan was false positive in one patient. In two other 
patients two sites of radiation necrosis showed no tracer concentration. We
conclude that (99m)Tc-DMSA(III) concentrates in recurrent brain tumors and can be
used for the imaging of these tumors.

Revisiting normal (51)Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid clearance values in
children.

Piepsz A(1), Tondeur M, Ham H.

Author information: 
(1)CHU St Pierre, Department of Radioisotopes, Brussels, Belgium.
amypiepsz@yahoo.com

PURPOSE: Normal (51)Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) clearance values as
a function of age were published a number of years ago. These values were based
on data from children with a normal left to right ratio and a normal appearance
on DMSA scintigraphy, despite the presence of an acute renal infection. At that
time, the authors were unaware that hyperfiltration is a common phenomenon in
patients with acute renal infection and that their normal values could have been 
significantly overestimated. The present work therefore aimed to re-appraise
these normal values.
METHODS: In a first step, in order to verify the previous results, the same type 
of population was selected, namely patients with present or past urinary tract
infection but normal images and a normal left to right ratio on DMSA
scintigraphy. In a second step, the selection was based on patients who had had
no recent urinary tract infection. In both series, a single blood sample method
was used for the evaluation of (51)Cr-EDTA clearance.
RESULTS: In the first group of patients, the results obtained were almost
identical to those previously published. In the second group of patients, the
results were significantly lower: after 2 years of age, the mean GFR value was
104 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (10th and 90th percentiles 81 and 135 ml/min/1.73 m(2),
respectively), compared with 117 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in the first group.
CONCLUSION: The data of the second group are probably more representative of the 
true normal GFR values and can be applied to the entire paediatric population.

Reflux nephropathy in kidney transplants, demonstrated by dimercaptosuccinic acid
scanning.

Coulthard MG(1), Keir MJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, UK. 
malcolm.coulthard@nuth.nhs.uk

BACKGROUND: This study determines why kidney transplants develop new focal
defects.
METHODS: Thirty children at a U.K. pediatric nephrology department receiving
kidney transplants had early and late dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans to
detect acquired focal defects, and their presence correlated with possible risk
factors. Associations between clinical events and focal DMSA lesions appearing in
grafts were measured.
RESULTS: Of the 30 early DMSA scans (within 2 weeks of function), one child with 
a thrombosed polar artery had a focal defect. On rescanning later, 11 (37%) had
acquired segmental defects; five were multiple, and their glomerular filtration
rates were 20 ml/min/1.73 m lower (95% CI 7-34). Histology in one case showed
pyelonephritic scarring. Reflux into the transplant ureter occurred in 19/27
(70%) of children tested (by radiological or indirect radionuclide cystography). 
Nine of 13 children (69%) who had a combination of reflux and a urine infection
had acquired scars, whereas only 1/14 (7%) did without this combination (P =
0.001). Scarring was not associated with the age or sex of the donor or
recipient, rejection episodes, renal biopsy, or drug-induced nephrotoxicity.
CONCLUSION: Kidney transplants are at high risk of developing segmental
pyelonephritic scars if infected urine refluxes into the graft, either early
through a transanastomotic stent or later from vesicoureteric reflux. These scars
may reduce the renal function and are readily seen on DMSA, but not ultrasound
scans. Consideration should be given to more effective antireflux surgery for
transplants, with subsequent testing for reflux, urinary antibiotic prophylaxis, 
and prompt treatment of urine infections.

Joubert syndrome is a severe autosomal recessive disorder, which is characterized
by hypotonia, impaired psychomotor development, retinal dystrophy with abnormal
ocular movements and cerebellar vermis agenesis with dilatation of the fourth
ventricle. Joubert syndrome type B is a developmental disorder of the
nephronophtisis complex with multiple organ involvement. Although this syndrome
is rare, since first described by Joubert et al in 1969, there have been several 
cases about the components and the chromosomal abnormalities related with it.
Here we report 2 patients with Joubert syndrome in whom renal involvement was
demonstrated by ultrasonography as renal cystic disorders which represented
nephronophtisis. For each patient we performed renal cortical scintigraphy with
99mTc-DMSA ( 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid) which showed bilaterally
decreased radiopharmaceutical uptake in kidneys due to tubulointerstitial
nephropathy. Scintigraphy may have a great value in the diagnosis and evaluation 
of the presence and severity of renal involvement in Joubert syndrome since it
can evaluate kidney parenchyma and functioning renal tissue.

Neither DMPS nor DMSA is effective in quantitative elimination of elemental
mercury after intentional IV injection.

Munich, Munich, Germany. Florian.Eyer@t-online.de

BACKGROUND: Intravenous injection of elemental mercury (Hg) is rare and
considered relatively harmless. Treatment recommendations vary and the
effectiveness of chelation therapy is controversial.
CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old man intravenously injected 1.5 mL of elemental Hg.
Within 12 hours he became febrile, tachycardic and dyspneic. Physical examination
was unremarkable. X-rays showed scattered radiodense deposits in the lung, heart,
intestinal wall, liver and kidney. The serum Hg level on admission was 172
microg/L and peaked on day 6 at 274 microg/L. Cumulative renal elimination during
a five day oral treatment period with 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS)
and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was 8 mg and 3 mg, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although urinary excretion could be enhanced during chelation
therapy, Hg deposits in organs resulted in negligible elimination of mercury
compared to the exposed dose.

Thiol exchange: an in vitro assay that predicts the efficacy of novel
homocysteine lowering therapies.

Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.

Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a risk factor for atherosclerosis.
Hcy is 70-80% bound to albumin as a disulfide. Recent trials have evaluated
ability of thiol-containing drugs to exchange with protein bound Hcy and
consequently increase its renal clearance. The objective of this study was to
develop an in vitro assay to predict the efficacy of thiol-containing drugs to
lower tHcy in the clinical setting. The assay was used to test the effects of
N-acetylcysteine (NAC), mesna, captopril, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), and
penicillamine. Hcy was added in vitro to plasma of healthy subjects (n = 6) and
equilibrated. Concentrations of thiol exchange agent were added and incubated at 
37 degrees C. Aliquots were removed at selected intervals and free Hcy
determined. Mesna, captopril, and NAC caused a concentration-dependent increase
in free Hcy. Three-hundred micromolar mesna and captopril had a greater effect
than equimolar NAC, increasing free Hcy by 33.9 +/- 5.0% and 32.0 +/- 2.6%,
respectively compared to 22.3 +/- 2.4% for NAC, p < 0.001. Our in vitro results
indicate that mesna, captopril, and NAC effectively exchange with covalently
bound Hcy. This assay can act as screening tool for novel tHcy lowering therapies
and should spare the expense of negative trials.

BACKGROUND: Renal scintigraphy, generally using 99mTc-DMSA, is the accepted
reference standard for detection of renal cortical changes. The timing of the
test, i.e., whether an acute 99mTc-DMSA scan, a follow-up only or both scans
should be performed, however, remains open to discussion. In our study, a
six-month follow- up DMSA scan was performed in all the children diagnosed with a
first attack of acute pyelonephritis (APN) in two large paediatric clinics of
Charles University's 3rd School of Medicine in Prague during a five-year period. 
All diagnoses were confirmed by a paediatric nephrologist.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 382 children (267 girls, 115 boys) aged between 7 months
and 19 years were included in the study. For analytical purposes, the patients
were divided into 4 age groups: I--less than 1 year of age, II--1-5 years,
III--5-10 years, and IV--10-19 years. In all children younger than five years, a 
micturition cystourethrogram (MCUG) for detection of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) 
was performed between one and three months after the APN episode. Static renal
scintigraphy, using an HR collimator with parallel holes was performed using a
planar Gamma camera MB 9200 (Gamma Budapest) in all children six months after
APN, with a complement of pinhole images, SPECT or PSPECT of the kidneys.
RESULTS: 1. In group I, all four children with positive VUR on MCUG had a
pathological DMSA scan, while only two of the 32 patients with negative VUR had a
pathological DMSA. 2. In group II, 17 children had VUR on MCUG, six of them with 
a pathological and 11 with a normal DMSA scan. Most of the 221 children without
VUR had a normal DMSA scintigraphy; pathological findings were present in 17
children only. 3. In group III, all children with VUR, but only 5 out of 53
without VUR, had a pathological DMSA scan. 4. Five out of 50 children in group IV
had a pathological DMSA.
CONCLUSIONS: APN occurred most frequently in group II (62.3%, or 238 children)
and ranged between 10-15% in the remaining groups. APN was found very frequently 
in boys less than one year old and showed a marked decrease with increasing age. 
Among girls, however, APN incidence was observed to increase with age.
Pathological renal changes were present in children with, as well as without,
VUR. The incidence of pathological DMSA findings six months after APN was
relatively low (44/382 patients, or 11.5%). Regular monitoring of these children 
is very important for detection of renal scarring.

Vesicoureteral reflux increases the risk of renal scars: a study of unilateral
reflux.

Lee JH(1), Son CH, Lee MS, Park YS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of 
Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on 
renal scar following acute pyelonephritis by comparing the refluxing renal units 
with nonrefluxing renal units in children with unilateral primary VUR.
Forty-eight children with unilateral primary VUR diagnosed after the first
pyelonephritis were enrolled. Mean age of patients was 1.0+/-1.6 years (29 boys
and 19 girls). All patients underwent renal ultrasonography and renal 99
m-technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan within three days following the 
diagnosis of pyelonephritis, and voiding cystourethrography (VCU) was performed
soon after fever subsided and the infection was controlled. The DMSA scan was
rechecked six months after the initial study when the first scan showed a renal
defect. The first DMSA showed renal defects in 34 (70.8%) out of 48 of the
refluxing renal units and in 13 (27.1%) out of 48 of the nonrefluxing renal units
(P<0.01, OR: 6.54). At six months after the infection, 23 (47.9%) out of 48
refluxing renal units and seven (14.6%) out of 48 nonrefluxing renal units had
renal scars on DMSA scan (P<0.01, OR: 5.39). The prevalence of renal scars did
not vary significantly according to the grade of VUR. The CRP level on admission 
was significantly higher in patients with acute renal defect and scar. In
conclusion, VUR increases the risk of post-pyelonephritic renal scars in
children.

Porphyrinuria in childhood autistic disorder: implications for environmental
toxicity.

Nataf R(1), Skorupka C, Amet L, Lam A, Springbett A, Lathe R.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratoire Philippe Auguste, Paris, France.

To address a possible environmental contribution to autism, we carried out a
retrospective study on urinary porphyrin levels, a biomarker of environmental
toxicity, in 269 children with neurodevelopmental and related disorders referred 
to a Paris clinic (2002-2004), including 106 with autistic disorder. Urinary
porphyrin levels determined by high-performance liquid chromatography were
compared between diagnostic groups including internal and external control
groups. Coproporphyrin levels were elevated in children with autistic disorder
relative to control groups. Elevation was maintained on normalization for age or 
to a control heme pathway metabolite (uroporphyrin) in the same samples. The
elevation was significant (P < 0.001). Porphyrin levels were unchanged in
Asperger's disorder, distinguishing it from autistic disorder. The atypical
molecule precoproporphyrin, a specific indicator of heavy metal toxicity, was
also elevated in autistic disorder (P < 0.001) but not significantly in
Asperger's. A subgroup with autistic disorder was treated with oral
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) with a view to heavy metal removal. Following DMSA
there was a significant (P = 0.002) drop in urinary porphyrin excretion. These
data implicate environmental toxicity in childhood autistic disorder.

Biofunctional ZnO nanorod arrays grown on flexible substrates.

Liu TY(1), Liao HC, Lin CC, Hu SH, Chen SY.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Materials Sciences and Engineering, National Chiao Tung
University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, 300, ROC.

A square pattern of thioctic acid self-assembled ZnO nanorod arrays was grown on 
a large 4-in. thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) flexible substrate via an in situ 
soluthermal process at low temperature (348 K). With the addition of
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), the surface chemistry forms a disordered ZnO
phase, and the morphology of the ZnO-DMSA nanorods changes with various DMSA
addition times. As evidenced by the Zn2p3/2, C1s, O1s, S2p, and N-1s scans of
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), DMSA and
proteins were conjugated on the single crystalline ZnO nanorods. The
photoluminescence (PL) spectra indicated that the optical properties of ZnO
nanorod arrays were changed while the DMSA was inserted, and proteins were
conjugated. Furthermore, a control test found that the ZnO nanorods show a
significant improvement in sensitive characterization over the ZnO film. As
another proteins (e.g., human serum albumin, HSA) were bound onto the ZnO-bovine 
serum albumin (BSA) nanorod arrays, an enhanced ultraviolet emission intensity
was detected. On the basis of these results, one might be expected to conjugate
specific biomolecules on the biofunctional ZnO nanorod arrays to detect the
complementary biomolecules by PL detecting.

Influence of Pi3-K and PKC activity on 99mTc-(V)-DMSA uptake: correlation with
tumour aggressiveness in an in vitro malignant glioblastoma cell line model.

PURPOSE: Intensive proliferation and a high degree of migration and invasion are 
characteristic features of malignant glioblastomas, associated with a poor
prognosis. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (Pi3-K) and protein kinase C (PKC) are
two phosphorylated proteins involved in glioblastoma cell progression.
Phosphorylated focal adhesion protein kinase (FAK) has also been reported to be
involved in tumour progression. In a recent study, we demonstrated a correlation 
between phosphorylated FAK, proliferation rate and 99mTc-(V)-dimercaptosuccinate 
[(V)-DMSA] uptake. We hypothesised that 99mTc-(V)-DMSA could be a potential
imaging agent to evaluate glioblastoma aggressiveness. The aim of the present
study was to assess the relationship between 99mTc-(V)-DMSA incorporation rate
and modulation of Pi3-K and PKC activity.
METHODS: Proliferation, migration and invasion capacities in the presence of
protein kinase modulators-staurosporine (PKC inhibitor), 4-phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (PMA; PKC activator) and LY294002 (Pi3-K inhibitor)-were correlated
with 99mTc-(V)-DMSA cell accumulation in an in vitro model of several malignant
glioma cells: G111 (grade II), U-87-MG (grade III) and G152 (grade IV).
RESULTS: In all cell lines tested, LY294002 and staurosporine treatment inhibited
cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In contrast, treatment with PMA
stimulated tumour aggressiveness. 99mTc-(V)-DMSA uptake was strongly correlated
with the % of cellular proliferation (r=0.8462) and the % of cellular migration
(r=0.9081), and to a lesser extent with the % of cellular invasion (r=0.7761).
CONCLUSION: Our results clearly demonstrated that 99mTc-(V)-DMSA reflects Pi3-K
and PKC activity and is correlated with tumour aggressiveness. 99mTc-(V)-DMSA
could be a reliable in vivo marker providing additional information on the
biological status of malignant glioblastoma.

OBJECTIVE: Relative renal function (RRF) quantification based on
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake is an established method for determining
differential renal function. An abnormal kidney size may lead to an alteration in
its RRF value, although it has no dysfunction. Therefore, it is useful to correct
RRF values taking into account relative renal volumes, thus obtaining the
normalized relative renal function (NRRF). The feasibility of the method used for
volume correction, differences with respect to usual quantification and different
normality intervals were studied.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 187 DMSA renal scintigraphies (130 children and 
57 adults) were studied. RRF was quantified and volume corrected to obtain NRRF. 
Patients were classified as normal or pathological using various normality
intervals for NRRF. A second classification was performed depending on how the
diagnostic changed after volume correction.
RESULTS: An increase of pathological diagnosis was observed after volume
correction, mainly in children. Using an intermediate estimation for the
normality interval, 53% of the initially pathological diagnosis for children may 
be caused simply by different renal volumes.
CONCLUSIONS: NRRF provides complementary information to RRF and helps to
distinguish between a smaller kidney and a really hypofunctioning one in cases
with abnormal RRF.

Nephrological indications in combined liver-kidney transplantation.

Hospital, Bologna, Italy.

In isolated liver transplantation pretransplant renal failure is a major
mortality risk, there are no guidelines at the moment to establish the
indications for a combined liver-kidney transplantation (LKT). In irreversible
chronic renal failure (CRF) not on dialysis, nephrological evaluation is required
to assess the need for a simultaneous kidney transplantation. There are no
experiences about the functional contribution of native kidneys post-LKT. Herein 
we have reported the case of two patients who underwent LKT in 2004 due to CRF,
not yet on dialysis. At the moment of LKT, the first patient (polycystic kidney
disease) had a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) = 29 mL/min, and the second
recipient (vascular nephropathy and diabetes), a GFR = 33 mL/min. In both cases
we did not observe delayed graft function. At discharge the serum creatinine was 
1.1 and 1.0 mg/dL, respectively, which was maintained during follow-up. In both
cases renal scintigraphy with Tc-99 DMSA was performed to evaluate the functional
contributions of transplanted versus native kidneys. In the first case
scintigraphy at 9 months after LKT demonstrated an 81% contribution from the
transplanted kidney, 9% from the right and 10% from the left native kidneys. In
the second case, at 3 months after LKT, the functional contributions were 76%,
10%, and 14%, respectively. The transplanted kidney nephron mass may avoid the
need for hemodialysis in the early posttransplant period; in the midterm it may
help to maintain residual renal function. As in other combined transplant
programs (heart-kidney, kidney-pancreas) with irreversible CRF, a GFR < or = 30
to 35 mL/min may be an indication for LKT, but we need more experience.

This report describes the preparation and characterization of new magnetic
fluorescent nanoparticles and our success in using them to label living cells.
The bifunctional nanoparticles possess a magnetic oxide core composed of a
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) ligand at the surface and a covalently attached
fluorescent dye. The nanoparticles exhibited a high affinity for cells, which was
demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and magnetophoresis. Fluorescence
microscopy was used to monitor the localization patterns of magnetic
nanoparticles associated with cells. We observed two types of magnetic labeling: 
adsorption of the nanoparticles on the cell membrane (membranous fluorescence)
and internalization of the nanoparticles inside the cell (intracellular vesicular
fluorescence). After internalization, nanoparticles were confined inside
endosomes, which are submicrometric vesicles of the endocytotic pathway. We
demonstrated that endosome movement could be piloted inside the cell by external 
magnetic fields such that small fluorescent chains of magnetic endosomes were
formed in the cell cytoplasm in the direction of the applied magnetic field.
Finally, by measuring the critical cellular magnetic load (quantitated by
magnetophoresis), we have demonstrated the potential of this new
magneto-fluorescent nanoagent for medical use.

OBJECTIVE: Fanconi syndrome is a renal dysfunction characterized by various
combinations of renal tubular transport dysfunction involving amino acids,
glucose, protein and other substances. Most reabsorption of amino acids occurs in
proximal renal tubule segment 1 (S1). The present study evaluated the possibility
of early detection of drug-induced Fanconi syndrome, based on decreased renal
accumulation of 125I-3-iodo-alpha-methyl-L-tyrosine (125I-IMT), an amino acid
transport marker, in the S1 region of renal cortex. The present experimental
model used maleate (MAL)-induced Fanconi syndrome in mice. Results were compared 
between 125I-IMT and 3 other clinical renal radiopharmaceuticals:
99mTc-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA);
99mTc-mercaptoacetylglycylglycylglycine (99mTc-MAG3); and
99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA).
METHODS: Male ddY mice (age, 6 weeks; body weight, 25 g) were used to create a
Fanconi model of renal dysfunction. A single dose of maleate disodium salt was
administered by intraperitoneal injection (6 mmol/kg). Hematoxylin and eosin (HE)
staining of the renal cortex, renal autoradiography and measurement of renal
radioactivity of labeled compounds were performed at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after
MAL injection. At 5 min after injection of labeled compounds (18.5 kBq for
accumulation experiment, 670 kBq for autoradiography), animals were sacrificed by
ether overdose and kidneys were removed. For the accumulation experiment,
radioactivity was measured using a well-type scintillation counter. For
autoradiography, 20-microm sections of frozen kidney were used with Bio-Imaging
Analyzer.
RESULTS: At 30 min after MAL injection, HE staining showed pyknosis in some
proximal tubule cells. At that time, accumulations of 125I-IMT and 99mTc-DMSA in 
the S1 region were approximately 67% and 55% of control levels (p < 0.005). MAL
increased accumulation of 99mTc-DTPA in the S1 region, but had no effect on
accumulation of 99mTc-MAG3 in the S 1 region.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreased accumulation of 123I-IMT in the S1 region appears to
represent a useful marker for detection of MAL-induced Fanconi syndrome. In
future, we plan to assess the efficacy of using 125I-IMT to monitor renal
dysfunction induced by nephrotoxic clinical drugs.

(1)Longevity Healthcare Center, San Luis Obispo, CA, USA.

Tissue mercury levels in humans have increased during the past 50 years to an
alarming concentration, with possible deleterious effects that may involve
neurological, cardiovascular, and immunological pathology. This article reviews
the protocol for the use of oral 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) and
oral meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in combination with intravenous
glutathione and high-dose vitamin C for treatment of high-level mercury. This
protocol yielded an average 69% reduction of urine mercury by provocation
analysis.

PURPOSE: Retroperitoneal laparoscopic heminephrectomy is a relatively new, well
tolerated, minimally invasive alternative to open surgery for children with a
nonfunctioning moiety in a duplex kidney. We collected data to assess outcomes in
our experience with this procedure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were retrospectively gathered on all patients
operated on for retroperitoneal laparoscopic heminephrectomy at our institution
between February 2001 and November 2004. Followup ultrasound was performed in all
patients, and additional imaging was done only when clinically indicated.
RESULTS: Retroperitoneal laparoscopic heminephrectomy was performed in 18 girls
and 4 boys (18 upper and 5 lower pole moieties). Indications included ureterocele
(12 patients), ectopic ureter (9) and vesicoureteral reflux (5). Mean age at
surgery was 5 years (range 4 months to 18 years). Four patients required
conversion to an open procedure due to inadequate exposure and were excluded from
further review. Urine leaks developed postoperatively in 3 patients and were
treated with Foley catheter drainage and/or stent placement. Two patients were
noted to have large (more than 5 cm) asymptomatic retroperitoneal fluid
collections on followup ultrasound. Functional loss of the remaining ipsilateral 
moiety was confirmed by DMSA scan in 2 children (ages 6 and 7 months). Doppler
studies confirmed normal hilar blood flow in both cases. Clinical presentation
for this subgroup included fever on postoperative day 3 in 1 patient and
hypertension at 32 months postoperatively in 1. Mean followup was 33 months
(range 3 to 56).
CONCLUSIONS: Although retroperitoneal laparoscopic renal ablative surgery in
children appears to be relatively safe and is associated with low morbidity,
serious complications may occur with subtle or even late presentation.

abnormalities in children with unilateral renal agenesis (RA) or multicystic
dysplastic kidney (MCDK). In total, 38 children (10 girls, 28 boys) were studied:
21 with RA and 17 with MCDK. In 14 children (37%) anomalies of the urinary tract 
were suspected prenatally in ultrasound studies. In the remaining 24 children the
diagnosis of RA/MCDK was made postnatally: in 13 (34%) in the first 7 days of
life, in 11 (29%) at the age of 8 days to 34 months, mean 10.6+/-8.05 months.
Voiding cystourethrography was done in 36 (95%) children, the isotopic
99mTc-EC/DMSA scan of the kidney in 29 (67%), and urography in 8. Urological
anomalies were present in 11 (29%) children: in 7 (33%) with RA and in 4 (24%)
with MCDK. Vesicoureteral reflux was diagnosed in 8 children: grade II in 4, III 
in 3, and IV in 1 (in 1 child to duplicated, in 1 to ectopic kidney);
ureterovesical junction obstruction in 2 (9.5%); and ureteropelvic junction
obstruction in 1 (4.8%). Among them, 2 children demanded surgery on the
contralateral urinary tract: pyeloplasty in 1, antireflux procedure in 1; while 9
children were treated conservatively. Compensatory hypertrophy of the
contralateral kidney was found in 90% of children. Thus due to an increased risk 
of pathological changes in the single functioning kidney, lifelong nephrological 
care is recommended in patients with unilateral RA/MCDK.

The present study deals with the therapeutic potential of combined administration
of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) along with monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA) against chronic
arsenic poisoning in guinea pigs. Animal were exposed to 50 ppm arsenic in
drinking water for 8 mo and subsequently treated for 5 consecutive days with 100 
mg/kg NAC (orally) and MiADMSA (intraperitoneally), individually or in
combination (50 mg/kg each). Arsenic exposure produced a significant depletion of
blood delta- aminolevulinic acid dehydrate (ALAD) activity, increased the blood
zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) level, and reduced blood and liver glutathione (GSH)
levels in guinea pigs. Hepatic oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and thiobarbituric
acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels showed a marked increase, whereas hepatic 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity decreased and acid phosphatase (ACP) activity
increased on arsenic exposure. Significant depletion of liver transaminase
activities on arsenic exposure suggests organ injury. Administration of MiADMSA, 
alone and in combination with NAC after arsenic exposure, was able to
significantly enhance hepatic GSH and to reduce GSSG and TBARS levels compared to
the arsenic control. Biochemical variables indicative of liver injury generally
remained insensitive to any of these treatments. The recoveries in parameters
indicative of oxidative stress were more marked in guinea pigs treated with
combined administration of NAC and MiADMSA than monotherapy. Interestingly, there
was a more pronounced depletion of arsenic from blood and tissues after combined 
treatment with NAC plus MiADMSA than MiADMSA. Blood and tissues copper, zinc,
iron, and calcium concentrations showed a significant increase after arsenic
exposure, which showed improvement, particularly after combined administration of
MiADMSA and NAC. Based on these data, a proposal can be made that greater
effectiveness in chelation treatment against chronic arsenic poisoning (i.e.,
turnover in the oxidative stress and removed of arsenic from the system) could be
achieved by combined administration of an antioxidant (preferably having a thiol 
moiety) with MiADMSA.

BACKGROUND: Acute pyelonephritis in children can leave a kidney scar that
eventually can lead to hypertension or renal failure. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic
acid renal scintigraphy (RC DMSA) is a widely accepted technique to assess
children with acute pyelonephritis.
AIM: To evaluate the presence of residual kidney scars detected through RC DMSA, 
in children with a first episode of acute pyelonephritis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical records of children with a first episode of acute 
pyelonephritis that were assessed within seven days of the episode with RC DMSA
were reviewed. Children were considered eligible if they did not have a new
episode of acute pyelonephritis and a second RC DMSA, one year after the first
episode, was performed. The presence or absence of a renal scar after one year
was associated to demographic, scintigraphy and laboratory variables.
RESULTS: Fifty nine children, aged 1 month to 10 years, 35 females, were studied.
Thirty nine percent had a renal scar in the scintigraphy perfomed after one year 
of follow up. The presence of a scar was correlated with a C reactive protein
over 130 mg/dl and an altered relative renal function (below 44%), during the
acute phase.
CONCLUSIONS: A high C reactive protein and alterations of relative renal function
during the acute phase of acute pyelonephritis in children, may be risk factors
for the development of renal scars in the long term follow up.

Genetic and biochemical evidence for the involvement of a molybdenum-dependent
enzyme in one of the selenite reduction pathways of Rhodobacter sphaeroides f.
sp. denitrificans IL106.

Selenite reduction in Rhodobacter sphaeroides f. sp. denitrificans was observed
under photosynthetic conditions, following a 100-h lag period. This adaptation
period was suppressed if the medium was inoculated with a culture previously
grown in the presence of selenite, suggesting that selenite reduction involves an
inducible enzymatic pathway. A transposon library was screened to isolate mutants
affected in selenite reduction. Of the eight mutants isolated, two were affected 
in molybdenum cofactor synthesis. These moaA and mogA mutants showed an increased
duration of the lag phase and a decreased rate of selenite reduction. When grown 
in the presence of tungstate, a well-known molybdenum-dependent enzyme
(molybdoenzyme) inhibitor, the wild-type strain displayed the same phenotype. The
addition of tungstate in the medium or the inactivation of the molybdocofactor
synthesis induced a decrease of 40% in the rate of selenite reduction. These
results suggest that several pathways are involved and that one of them involves 
a molybdoenzyme. Although addition of nitrate or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the
medium increased the selenite reduction activity of the culture, neither the
periplasmic nitrate reductase NAP nor the DMSO reductase is the implicated
molybdoenzyme, since the napA and dmsA mutants, with expression of nitrate
reductase and DMSO reductase, respectively, eliminated, were not affected by
selenite reduction. A role for the biotine sulfoxide reductase, another
characterized molybdoenzyme, is unlikely, since its overexpression in a defective
strain did not restore the selenite reduction activity.

[Vesicoureteral reflux grades III-IV: factors involved in the efficacy of
endoscopic treatment in pediatric patients].

OBJECTIVES: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is detected in 30-50% of pediatric
patients diagnosed of urinary tract infection (UTI). Multiple clinical trials
have compared the results of conservative management against surgical therapy.
The introduction of a third alternative in 1984 (endoscopic approach) has
dramatically modified the management of VUR. The objective of our work is to
analyze the factors influencing the favourable outcome of the endoscopic
treatment of VUR.
METHODS: Retrospective and prospective cohort study analyzing 90 patients with
grades III and IV VUR treated endoscopically over the last eight years. 184
patients undergoing endoscopic management were selected from a group of 550
patients (735 VUR renal units) with the diagnosis of VUR over the study period.
All patients underwent VCUG or galactose-based sonocystography to obtain the
diagnosis. DMSA scintigram was used to evaluate renal damage. Data about gender, 
age, UTI, bilateralism, renal damage, voiding dysfunction, outcomes,
complications, and recurrences were registered. A new factor was defined:
ureteral dilation independent from the international classification. This factor 
was evaluated by a single pediatric urologist blinded for the international
classification results. Data analysis was performed using the chi square test and
Fischer exact test; a multiple logistic regression analysis was also performed.
Statistical significance was established at p < 0.05. SPSS 11.0 software was
employed for data analysis.
RESULTS: Boys/girls ratio was 2.91. Bilateral VUR appeared in 44.4% of the cases.
UTI was the presenting diagnosis in 64 cases; the diagnosis was prenatal in 21
cases (with a male predominance 5.2:1). We found a strong correlation between
renal scarring at the time of diagnosis and voiding dysfunction (p< 0.01). Cure
rate after first injection was 64%. Although univariate analysis showed a strong 
correlation between cure and first injection, biloterality, voiding dysfunction, 
initial nephropathy, and ureteral dilation grade, on multivariate logistic
regression the only significant factor to predict treatment response was the
existence of severe ureteral dilation in comparison with mild dilation (p <
0.001; odds ratio 0.045, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.16). Renal damage
progression was specially detected in those patients with voiding dysfunction (p 
= 0.053), bilaterality (p = 0.034) and severe ureteral dilation (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A direct relation between cure rate after endoscopic treatment of
grade III and IV reflux and severity of ureteral dilation was demonstrated. Other
relevant factors implied in the endoscopic resolution of VUR include the
existence of voiding dysfunction, bilateral reflux and renal damage determined by
DMSA at the time of initial diagnosis. Gender, age, and number of infections
during follow up have no influence in the probability of cure of grade III and IV
VU reflux treated with subureteral injection of biocompatible substances.

The aim of the study was to evaluate renal growth and function of solitary kidney
in paediatric patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was performed
in a fifteen years period between 1988 and 2003 in paediatric patients with a
solitary kidney, in a Children's Hospital. All the following parameters were
evaluated every year: age, sex, ethiology, elapsed time since the concept of
solitary kidney was assessed (ET), blood pressure, renal function measured by
GFR, urinary excretion of solutes, concentration ability and microalbuminuria
(MA). DMSA was made at the beginning and every five years and renal
ultrasonography was carried out every two years. Two groups were made depending
of nephrourologic malformations in the remanent kidney and/or antecedents of
pyelonephritis: Group I with antecedents of pyelonephritis and/or malformations; 
Group II, nor antecedents of pyelonephritis neither malformations.
RESULTS: Ninety five patients were evaluated, 69% (n = 66) were males and 31% (n 
= 29) were females, with an age at diagnosis of 3.5 yr (ranged 0.1-17 yrs). ET
was 9.2 yrs (range 1-20 yrs). The ethiology was: Nephrectomy of the contralateral
kidney 39 patients (pts) (41%), renal agenesis (RA) 47 pts (49%) and
nonfunctioning multicystic displastic kidney (MCDK) 9 pts (9.4%). Functional
alterations were found in 18 pts (19%), such as MA in 12 pts (12.6%), decreased
GRF in 5 pts (5.5%) and hypertension in 3 pts (3.2%). It was observed more
significant functional alterations in the patients of the Group I (58%) versus
Group II (9%) (p < 0.001). There was in Group II a significant correlation
between kidney size and GFR (p < 0.01, r = 0.3), and between kidney size and ET
(P < 0.05; r = 0.3).
CONCLUSIONS: Any alteration in the renal function was observed in the 12.6% of
the children. The most frequent affected parameter of renal damage was MA,
followed by GFR reduction. Arterial hypertension was not a prominent finding.
Alterations have been less frequently found in RA and MCDK of the Group II, so
clinical reviews should be made with a lesser frequency.

PURPOSE: Age-related values of (123)I-orthoiodohippurate (OIH) single kidney
clearance rate (Cl) were estimated in a large cohort of likely normal children
aged between 0 and 18 years.
METHODS: Among 4,111 children examined in the past 10 years, 917 were selected
with the following inclusion criteria: (a) mild ultrasonographic hydronephrosis
with right differential renal function (DRF) <53% and >47% (498 pts), (b) known
or suspected urinary tract infection with normal ultrasound, serum creatinine and
DMSA and DRF <53% and >47% (419 pts). (123)I-OIH-Cl was assessed using a
validated gamma camera method. Children were divided into 21 age classes: from 0 
to 2 years, eight 3-month classes; from 2 to 14 years, twelve 1-year classes;
from 14 to 18 years, one 4-year class.
RESULTS: Cl, plotted against age, was fitted using an increasing function
(y=a-be-cx). Mean (123)I-OIH-Cl of 1,834 kidneys was 306+/-22 ml/min/1.73 m(2)
BSA. Mean (123)I-OIH-Cl of the right and left kidneys was 307+/-23 and 305+/-22
ml/min/1.73 m(2) BSA, respectively (p<0.002). The best-fitting (123)I-OIH-Cl
growing function was: Cl=311-230e-0.69xAge (months). (123)I-OIH-Cl improved
progressively starting from birth, reaching 96% and 98% of the mature value at 1 
and 1.5 years, respectively. (123)I-OIH-Cl at birth (age=0) was 81 ml/min/1.73
m(2) BSA. After 18.6 days of life, the renal function had doubled its starting
value, and it reached a plateau of 311 ml/min/1.73 m(2) BSA at 2 years.
CONCLUSION: This work represents a systematic evaluation of ERPF by a gamma
camera method in a large cohort of selected likely normal paediatric subjects.

Technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy in children with
urinary tract infections.

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of abnormal
dimercaptosuccinic acid-Tc-99m ((99m)Tc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy findings in
children with culture proved urinary tract infection (UTI) with or without
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy was performed in 343
children with culture documented UTI (247 girls and 96 boys) aged from three
months to 14 years (middle age of 4.82 years). The children studied were all
those submitted for renal scintiscan to the Institute of Nuclear Medicine,
Military Medical Academy, Belgrade during a five-year period (2000-2004).
Micturating cystoureterography (MCU) performed in all patients before
(99m)Tc-DMSA scan, revealed VUR in 213 children, while in 130 children VUR was
not detected by MCU. In 15 of the 213 children the grade of VUR was I, in 88 was 
II, in 57 was III, in 33 was IV and 20 children had grade V of VUR. Findings of
(99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy were classified as: normal, equivocal and
abnormal. Statistical analysis was performed using c(2)test. In all patients
abnormal findings were detected in 38% (131/343), normal in 51% (174/343) and
equivocal findings in 11% (38/343). In children with UTI and VUR the incidence of
abnormal findings was 53% (112/213), of normal 37% (80/213) and of equivocal
findings 10% (21/213). In children with UTI without VUR the incidence of abnormal
findings was 15% (19/130), of normal findings 72% (94/130), and of equivocal
findings 13% (17/130). The incidence of abnormal findings was significantly
higher in children with UTI and VUR than in those with UTI without VUR (P<0.001).
In children with VUR grades I, II, III, IV and V abnormal findings were 33%, 32%,
60%, 79% and 95% respectively. The incidence of abnormal findings was higher in
children with VUR grades IV and V, than in grade I and II (P<0.001). Our results 
suggest that (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy in children can discriminate between
grade I-II and IV-V of VUR and also that in children with UTI and VUR abnormal
findings in the scintiscan were more than three times higher than in children
with UTI alone.

Changes in brain biogenic amines and haem biosynthesis and their response to
combined administration of succimers and Centella asiatica in lead poisoned rats.

Saxena G(1), Flora SJ.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Defence Research and Development
Establishment, Jhansi Road, Gwalior-474 002, India.

This study was designed to investigate the therapeutic potential of meso
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and one of its monoesters, monoisoamyl DMSA
(MiADMSA), individually or when administered in combination with an extract of
Centella asiatica against experimental lead intoxication in rats. Biochemical
variables indicative of alterations in the central nervous system and haem
biosynthesis were investigated to determine the toxicity in male Wistar rats.
Thirty five rats were exposed to 0.2% lead acetate for 10 weeks, followed by 10
days of treatment with DMSA and MiADMSA (50 mg kg(-1), i.p., once daily) alone
and in combination with C. asiatica (200 mg kg(-1), p.o., once daily).
Biochemical variables indicative of oxidative stress and brain biogenic amines,
along with lead concentration in blood and brain, were measured. Lead exposure
caused a significant depletion of blood and brain delta-aminolevulinic acid
dehydratase (ALAD) activity, an important enzyme of the haem biosynthesis
pathway, and glutathione (GSH) level. These changes were accompanied by a marked 
increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, thiobarbituric acid reactive
substances (TBARS), delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS) and oxidized
glutathione (GSSG) activity in blood and brain. Significant depletion of brain
noradrenaline (norepinephrine, NE), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) also were observed following lead exposure. Also seen
was a significant depletion in brain glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione
S-transferase (GST) and monoamine oxidase activity, as well as blood and brain
superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. These biochemical changes were correlated
with an increased uptake of lead in blood and brain. Combined administration of
MiADMSA and C. asiatica was most effective in reducing these alterations,
including biogenic amines, besides reducing body lead burden, compared with
individual treatment with MiADMSA. Certain other biochemical variables responded 
favourably to combination therapy and monotherapy with MiADMSA. Thus,
supplementation of C. asiatica during chelation could be recommended for
achieving optimum effects of chelation therapy.

In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated inhibition of glioblastoma growth 
by imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). Imatinib is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase
activities of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-r), which is involved
in glioblastoma aggressiveness. In this study, we have investigated the link
between 99mTc-(V)-DMSA, an imaging agent used in Single Photon Emission Computed 
Tomography, cellular accumulation and the biological effects of imatinib mediated
by PDGF-r in a human glioblastoma cell line U87-MG. Cells treated with imatinib
showed significant decreases in proliferation, invasion, migration and PDGF-rbeta
expression. 99mTc-(V)-DMSA cellular uptake studies showed that the specific
action of imatinib on PDGF-r signal pathway, in the human glioblastoma cell line 
U87-MG, could be followed by radioactive tracer. Furthermore, strong correlations
between cellular 99mTc-(V)-DMSA uptake and the effect of imatinib therapy on
U87-MG proliferation (r=0.896), invasion (r=0.621) and migration (r=0.822) were
obtained, likewise for 99mTc-(V)-DMSA uptake and PDGF-r expression (r=0.958). Our
results show that the biological effects of imatinib therapy on tumour cells
properties are linked to PDGF-r phosphorylation and could be traced with
99mTc-(V)-DMSA, which also seems to be a potential tracer to evaluate the
response to imatinib therapy in glioblastoma.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of urinary tract infection
(UTI) in newborns with asymptomatic, unexplained indirect hyperbilirubinemia in
the first two weeks of life. Jaundiced infants, otherwise clinically well, less
than two weeks of ages, with a total bilirubin level above 15 mg/dl were eligible
for the study. A bilirubin work-up including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G-6 PD) level, as well as urinalysis and a urine culture were performed in all
patients. Patients with UTI, defined as more than 10,000 colony-forming units per
milliliter of a single pathogen obtained by bladder catheterization, were
evaluated for sepsis. Renal function tests and renal ultrasound were performed in
cases with UTI. During follow-up, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and
dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) were performed as well. A total of
102 patients were enrolled. The bilirubin work-up of patients did not demonstrate
any significant underlying disorder. None of the infants had a high direct
bilirubin level. UTI was diagnosed in eight (8%) cases [Enterobacter aerogenes
(3/8:38%), Enterococcus faecalis (2/8:25%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2/8:25%) and
Escherichia coli (1/8:12%)]. Of those eight patients, only four (50%) had pyuria.
Bacteriuria was present in seven (88%) patients. The sepsis screen was negative
in all but one case with a high C-reactive protein (CRP) level. None of the
patients had a positive blood culture. Renal function tests were within normal
levels in all patients. Renal ultrasound showed urinary tract abnormalities in
three (38%) patients (hydronephrosis, n=1 and pelviectasis, n=2). VCUG was
performed in all patients during the study period and one had unilateral grade
3-4 reflux, while only one patient had a diverticulum of the bladder. DMSA was
performed in seven patients and none had renal scars. It is of importance that
UTI can occur in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants even in the first week of life. 
Although it is well known that UTI is a common cause of prolonged jaundice, urine
culture should be considered in the bilirubin work-up of infants older than three
days of age with an unknown etiology.

The efficacy of three radiopharmaceuticals, 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid (99mTc-DTPA), 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA), and
99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mTc-MAG3), for renal imaging was examined in 16
corn snakes (Elaphe guttata guttata). All snakes received the radiopharmaceutical
via an intracardiac injection. The kidneys could not be visualized in the three
snakes that received 99mTc-DTPA or in the three snakes that received 99mTc-DMSA, 
but were well delineated in all 10 snakes receiving 99mTc-MAG3. These snakes were
anesthetized and a dynamic frame mode acquisition was obtained for 30 min
immediately following injection. A 60 s single static frame mode image was then
obtained with the snake in a curled position. Two of the 10 snakes that received 
99mTc-MAG3 were removed from further analysis because of suspected pericardial
injections. Of the remaining eight snakes, the mean (+/- SD) renal uptake was 25 
+/- 9.8% or 24 +/- 9.7%, with or without correction for residual injection site
activity, respectively. Correction for remaining radioactivity in the heart does 
not appear to be necessary if it is less than 10% of the total dose. 99mTc-MAG3
provided consistently high quality images of the kidneys and further studies are 
warranted to evaluate its sensitivity for detecting decreased function in snakes 
with renal disease.

INTRODUCTION: Currently, consensus is lacking on the indications for surgery in
primary congenital unilateral hydronephrosis.
OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of
severe asymptomatic primary congenital unilateral hydronephrosis (grades 3 and
4).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 98 neonates with
severe primary congenital unilateral hydronephrosis. Diagnostic techniques
consisted of ultrasound, renogram, and DMSA scan.
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 24 days. The mean length of follow-up was 
4 years. Forty-eight percent of cases were grade 3 and the remaining cases were
grade 4. Fifty-six percent of the patients received conservative treatment.
Forty-four percent underwent surgery. Surgical indications consisted of prolonged
T1/2, reduced differential renal function and/or very severe hydronephrosis. The 
mean age at surgery was 5.5 months. In 94 % of the patients who received
conservative treatment, hydronephrosis resolved spontaneously. In this group,
renal parenchyma and renal function were normal in all patients except two. In 97
% of the patients who received surgical treatment, hydronephrosis was corrected
or improved after pyeloplasty. At diagnosis, 19 kidneys had reduced function. In 
the postsurgical renogram, although T1/2 had markedly improved, 8 kidneys showed 
reduced function. DMSA performed in 63 patients belonging to both groups, outside
the active phase of hydronephrosis, revealed 8 atrophic kidneys, 4 with
moderately reduced renal size and function and 4 with scarring and normal renal
size and function. During the study period, overall function was maintained in
all patients and none developed hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe congenital unilateral hydronephrosis resolves spontaneously
in most patients. Consequently, clinicians increasingly adopt a conservative
approach. The available diagnostic techniques cannot identify patients who will
benefit from pyeloplasty. In general, accepted surgical indications are an
increase in hydronephrosis and/or worsening of renal function. In our series, 15 
% of the patients with hydronephrosis had an irreversible lesion of variable
severity, which in some patients seemed to have developed during embryogenesis.
Kidneys at risk of presenting a lesion were those that had grade 4
hydronephrosis.

Fifty-six children (35 boys and 21 girls) below the age of 12 years with primary 
Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) detected by voiding cystourethrogram after an initial
episode of documented urinary tract infection (UTI), were studied prospectively
for a period of 6-12 years (Mean 8 years) with reference to scarring, grade of
reflux, break-through infections, adverse effects to prophylactic drugs and
clinical and laboratory evidence of renal failure. The mean age at presentation
was 1.95 years. Grade I-V reflux occurred in 7.1%, 28.6%, 48.2%, 12.5%, 3.6%
respectively. Thirty-one (55.3%) had detectable renal scars on dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) scan. All of them were treated with low dose prophylactic antibiotics
until the age of 5 years. None had any major adverse effects to the prophylactic 
antibiotics. Ten (17.9%) had breakthrough UTI while on prophylaxis and 3 (5.4%)
had UTI after discontinuing prophylaxis at 5 years of age. Two patients underwent
ureteric reimplantation. Clinical and laboratory evidence of renal failure was
not observed during the follow up period. Systolic blood pressure of all patients
was below the 90th percentile for age. One had significant proteinuria. Majority 
of this cohort of patients with varying degrees of reflux nephropathy were
managed conservatively with regular monitoring and low-dose prophylactic
antibiotic therapy.

Technology, Haifa, Israel. boaz.moskovitz@b-zion.org.il

PURPOSE: To measure the effect of PCNL on global and regional renal function
using quantitative single-photon emission CT (SPECT) measurement of
Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake by the kidneys (QDMSA).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 47 male and 41 female patients with a mean age 
of 47 +/- 16 years were studied by sequential QDMSA examinations before and 1.5
to 24 months after PCNL. Among the 67 patients (76%) in whom PCNL was performed
using upper- or lower-pole access, the function of the affected and nonaffected
poles of the treated kidney was calculated separately.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the uptake by the
treated kidneys before versus after PCNL (11.9% +/- 5% v 11.6% +/- 5%; t = 0.9; P
= 0.368). The total functional volume of the treated kidney was slightly
decreased, from 235 cc +/- 62 cc to 224 cc +/- 59 cc (t = 2.7; P = 0.011). The
percent of the injected isotope dose per cubic centimeter of tissue of the
treated kidney was not affected (0.051 +/- 0.02 v 0.053 +/- 0.02; t = 0.86; P =
0.296). Regional assessment revealed a statistically significant decrease in the 
functional volume at the PCNL port of entry (91 cc +/- 30 cc v 82 cc +/- 27 cc; t
= 2.64; P = 0.013). Regarding the percent of the injected dose per cubic
centimeter of renal tissue, no statistically significant difference was found
between the area of the kidney that underwent PCNL and the untreated area of the 
same kidney (0.049 +/- 0.02 v 0.05 +/- 0.02; t = 0.693; P = 0.494). The function 
of the contralateral kidneys remained unchanged (13.4% +/- 5.2% v 13.6% +/- 4.8%;
t = 0.68; P = 0.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the statistically significant decrease in the functional
volume of the surgically treated region, neither total percent uptake nor percent
of injected dose were reduced significantly. Further studies with long-term
follow-up of treated kidneys are required.

ultrasonography in detecting renal scars in children with primary vesicoureteral 
reflux (VUR).

INTRODUCTION: Pyelonephritis-induced renal scarring in children is a major
predisposing factor for proteinuria, hypertension, and ultimate renal failure.
The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of Tc99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy and renal ultrasonography
(USG) in detecting renal scars in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux
(VUR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tc-DMSA scan and USG studies were done in 62 children who 
were admitted to our clinic between 1997 and 2003 because of documented urinary
tract infection (UTI) and diagnosed with primary VUR. Renal scarring detection
rates of Tc-DMSA scan and USG were compared according to reflux grades.
RESULTS: In the whole group, renal scars were detected by Tc-DMSA scan and USG in
55% and 38% of refluxing units, respectively. Detection rates of Tc-DMSA and USG 
according to reflux grades were as follows: 47% and 29 % in low-grade VUR (grades
1 and 2), 46 % and 25% in mid-grade VUR (grade 3), 76% and 65% in high-grade VUR 
(grades 4 and 5), respectively.
CONCLUSION: USG was found to be an inappropriate study in the detection of renal 
parenchymal scars, irrespective of the reflux grade. In this study, Tc-DMSA scan 
detected scars in 35% of kidneys reported to be normal on USG.

Role of technetium-99m N,N-ethylenedicysteine renal scintigraphy in the
evaluation of differential renal function and cortical defects.

Buyukdereli G(1), Guney IB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine,
Adana, Turkey. gulgunb@cu.edu.tr

PURPOSE: This study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of technetium-99m
N,N-ethylenedicysteine (Tc-99m EC) in comparison to technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99m DMSA) scintigraphy. Differential renal function
(DRF) was calculated by both methods and the cortical-phase images of dynamic
Tc-99m EC scintigraphy were evaluated for parenchymal defects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 62 patients with various kidney disorders
ranging in age from 1 to 44 years underwent both Tc-99m DMSA and Tc-99m EC
scintigraphy. Tc-99m EC summed images of the cortical phase and Tc-99m DMSA
images were evaluated visually and quantitatively. Visual analysis was used to
define renal parenchymal abnormalities. Quantitative analysis was used in the
calculation of DRF. The Tc-99m DMSA scan was taken as the gold standard, and the 
summed Tc-99m EC scan findings were compared against it.
RESULTS: The images obtained with Tc-99m DMSA and Tc-99m EC scintigraphy revealed
99 and 97 focal defects, respectively. The 2 renal parenchyma defects located in 
the ventral middle sections remained undetected with Tc-99m EC scintigraphy. DRF 
of the kidneys in each patient was compared using both radiopharmaceuticals.
Highly positive correlation between the differential function of these 2
investigations was found (R = 0.91, P = 0.001). The values of mean DRF of the
left kidney on Tc-99m EC and Tc-99m DMSA images were 45.8 +/- 19.1 and 45.0 +/-
20.4, respectively. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that although Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy remains
the gold standard method for evaluating parenchymal abnormalities, Tc-99m EC
scintigraphy can be a reliable single-modality study to evaluate renal cortical
defects, DRF, perfusion, drainage of the urinary system, and indirect evidence of
vesicoureteric reflux with the added advantage of low radiation exposure to the
patient.

Therapeutic effects of hypothermia on Lewisite toxicity.

Nelson P(1), Hancock JR, Sawyer TW.

Author information: 
(1)Chemical Biological Defence Section, Defence Research and Development

The cytotoxicity of the arsenical vesicant Lewisite was assessed in first passage
cultures of proliferating neonatal human skin keratinocytes. Both munitions grade
and distilled Lewisite were extremely toxic with LC(50) values in the low ng/ml
range, with no significant differences between them. This similarity in toxicity 
was also mirrored with respect to their toxic effects on hairless guinea pig
skin. Two-, 4- and 6-min vapour exposures of these agents resulted in similar and
severe skin injury that was obvious by 3-5h post-exposure and almost maximal at
24h. The toxicity of Lewisite in culture was temperature dependent, with a
>10-fold reduction in 24h LC(50) values as the incubation temperature was reduced
from 37 to 25 degrees C. However, this cooling induced protection was not
persistent. In contrast, cooling of Lewisite exposed hairless guinea pig skin at 
approximately 10 degrees C for as little as 30 min post-exposure resulted in
dramatic and permanent protection, with 4h of cooling almost completely
eliminating Lewisite induced skin injury. Further, significant protection was
also evident even when cooling was delayed for as long as 2h post-Lewisite
exposure. In an effort to investigate whether cooling might also increase the
window in which chelation therapy against this vesicant agent would be useful, we
examined the protective effects of the heavy metal chelator dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA). Topical application to Lewisite exposed skin was extremely
protective, even when delayed for 2h after Lewisite. Cooling of Lewisite exposed 
skin for 2h, followed by DMSA topical application resulted in decreased skin
injury compared to either treatment in isolation. It appears that the simple and 
non-invasive application of cooling measures may provide not only significant
therapeutic relief to Lewisite exposed skin, but that it may also increase the
therapeutic window in which medical countermeasures against this vesicant agent
are useful.

    Eur Urol. 2006 May;49(5):777-8.

OBJECTIVE: Renal scarring and renal failure remain life-threatening for children 
born with spinal dysraphism. We reviewed our data of spina bifida patients to
evaluate whether optimal treatment of the neurogenic bladder from birth onwards
can preserve kidney function.
METHODS: We reviewed data on all newborns with spinal dysraphism who were
referred to our hospital between January 1988 and June 2001. We looked at their
situations at referral and at follow-up: the type of treatment, antimuscarinic
agents, clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC), antibiotic prophylaxis, and
operations (sling procedures, bladder augmentations, antireflux procedures).
Renal function (ultrasound, DMSA scan, serum creatinin, creatinin clearance) and 
bladder function (urodynamic studies) were evaluated over time.
RESULTS: Data of 144 children of 176 could be evaluated by the end of the study: 
5 patients had pre-existing renal abnormalities, 69 had an overactive sphincter, 
27 had reflux, and six had renal scarring. None are currently developing
end-stage renal disease. All patients with spina bifida aperta started CIC and
antimuscarinic therapy shortly after birth. Five of the six patients with renal
scarring were started on therapy with intermittent catheterisation and
antimuscarinic therapy several months after birth. Sixty-three of 82 children
with spina bifida were dry at school age (age six), although 37 of these had not 
had an operation.
CONCLUSION: We show that an early start to therapy helps to safeguard renal
function for children born with spina bifida. Our data support other recent
reports that children born with spina bifida can probably use their own kidneys
for a lifetime, if they are given adequate urological treatment. To protect the
upper urinary tract, we need to ensure low intravesical pressure by starting
children early on CIC (the preferred treatment); antimuscarinic agents to
counteract detrusor instability are indispensable in most cases. Proactive
treatment of risks for upper tract deterioration results in a negligible loss of 
renal function, even when early urinary continence is included in the treatment
protocol.

We present a 71-year-old man who underwent closure of an ileostomy and had a
fever seven days post surgery. Both Tc-99m(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 
gallium-67 citrate scans showed increased tracer accumulation in the right lower 
quadrant of the abdomen. Tc-99m(V)-DMSA scintigraphy can be a rapid alternative
tool in the detection of wound infection in patients after ileostomy closure.

The interaction of the VO2+ cation with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
was investigated by electron absorption spectroscopy in aqueous solution at
different pH values. The spectral behavior, complemented with a
spectrophotometric titration, shows the generation of a [VO(DMSA)2]2- complex in 
which the oxocation interacts with two pairs of deprotonated -SH groups of the
acid. It was also found that DMSA rapidly reduces VO3- to VO2+, which might be
chelated by an excess of the acid. DMSA can also produce the partial reduction of
a V2O5 suspension at pH=5.2. The results of this study suggest that DMSA might be
a potentially useful detoxification agent for vanadium.

A nine-year-old male black Giant Schnauzer dog was referred for the scintigraphic
evaluation with a history of malignant fibrosarcoma with a rapidly growing non
painful mass on the left shoulder region quite near to the site of an operation
performed four months ago. We carried out oncological scintigraphy using
pentavalent (99m)Technetium labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid [(99m)Tc(V)-DMSA], a
tumour localising radiopharmaceutical agent. The study was performed to assess
the margins, vascularity of the tumour and response to the cancer therapy.
Uniform intense radiopharmaceutical uptake was observed in the lesion indicating 
its margins, vascularity and malignant nature. The dog was subjected to external 
radiation therapy to control the growth of the cancer and to bring the tumour
mass to an operable size. The dog was followed up with (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA
scintigraphy pre-irradiation and post-irradiation. Immediately after the
post-irradiation scintigraphy, the dog was operated on. During the surgery,
resection of the tumour margins was performed carefully using a hand held gamma
probe to assure that no tumour tissue was left inside. In conclusion, the authors
would like to state that (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA oncoscintigraphy is valuable in the
assessment and evaluation of therapy in canine soft tissue cancer.

Dithiol compounds at low concentrations increase arsenite toxicity.

Jan KY(1), Wang TC, Ramanathan B, Gurr JR.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei 11529,
Taiwan, ROC.

Inorganic trivalent arsenicals are vicinal thiol-reacting agents, and
dithiothreitol (DTT) is a well-known dithiol agent. Interestingly, both
decreasing and increasing effects of DTT on arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis
have been reported. We now provide data to show that, at high concentrations,
DTT, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), and dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS)
decreased arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells, a human promyelocytic 
leukemia cell line. In contrast, at low concentrations DTT, DMSA, and DMPS
increased the arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis. DTT at a high concentration (3 
mM) decreased, whereas at a low concentration (0.1 mM), it increased the cell
growth inhibition of arsenic trioxide, methylarsonous acid (MMA(III)), and
dimethylarsinous acid (DMA(III)) in NB4 cells. DMSA and DMPS are currently used
as antidotes for acute arsenic poisoning. These two dithiol compounds also show
an inverse-hormetic effect on arsenic toxicity in terms of DNA damage,
micronucleus induction, apoptosis, and colony formation in experiments using
human epithelial cell lines derived from arsenic target tissues such as the
kidney and bladder. With the oral administration of dithiols, the concentrations 
of these dithiol compounds in the human body are likely to be low. Therefore, the
present results suggest the necessity of reevaluating the therapeutic effect of
these dithiol compounds for arsenic poisoning.

Scintigraphy with Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is considered a reference
method for assessment of parenchymal lesions and estimation of differential
kidney function. The aim of study was to evaluate Tc-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine
(MAG3) dynamic renal scintigraphy for the same purpose. 188 patients, submitted
to both studies within three months, were divided in two groups. In the first, 83
DMSA images were compared to parenchymal phase of MAG3 scintigraphy. Kidney
morphology was independently evaluated by four observers. In the second group (N 
= 105), differential function was calculated in MAG3 and DMSA studies and the
respective results were compared. Findings corresponded completely in 85% of
patients. There were no statistically significant differences between calculated 
differential function on DMSA and MAG3 images. The results showed that most of
parenchymal lesions detected on DMSA scans can be identified on MAG3 parenchymal 
scans. Both studies can be equally used for the calculation of differential
kidney function.

Renal resistive index early detects chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy in
normo- and hypertensive patients.

BACKGROUND: We studied whether the measurement of intrarenal vascular resistance 
by Doppler ultrasonography, capable of investigating renal interstitial
compartment, allows the early detection of chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy
(TIN).
METHODS: 30 normotensive and 28 hypertensive (I-II OMS) patients with a clinical 
history suggestive of chronic TIN and normal renal function were enrolled. 40
healthy volunteers served as controls. Patients were considered TIN-negative or
TIN-positive after investigating tubular function by urine concentrating and
acidification tests. Renal sonographic parameters and renal resistive index (RRI)
were obtained by duplex scanner. Glomerular filtration rate/effective renal
plasmatic flow ratio was investigated by sequential renal scintigraphy in
TIN-negative and TIN-positive patients; (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy was also
performed in TIN-positive patients.
RESULTS: RRI values of TIN-positive normotensive and hypertensive patients were
significantly higher (p < 0.01 for both) than those of TIN-negative patients and 
of controls. RRI values resulted to be linearly related to uricemia (r = 0.88, p 
< 0.0001) only in normotensive patients. RRI values also resulted to be linearly 
related to filtration ratio values (r = 0.60, p < 0.0001). (99m)Tc-DMSA
scintigraphy confirmed interstitial renal damage (grade 1 and 2).
CONCLUSION: RRI measurement allows the early identification of both normotensive 
and hypertensive patients with chronic TIN and signs of tubular dysfunction, when
renal function is still preserved.

The oncophilic complex of technetium-99m labeled pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic
acid (99mTc(V)-DMSA) has been successfully used for the detection of primary and 
metastatic medullary thyroid cancer and for imaging various soft tissue tumors
like lung, brain and prostate cancer. In this article, the role of 99mTc(V)-DMSA 
in the diagnosis of the primary tumor and metastases of osteosarcoma patients as 
compared to the 99mTc-MDP scan and the CT scan was studied. Twenty-eight patients
with bone disease were referred to the Nuclear Medicine Department of Saint Savas
Oncology Hospital in Athens from the Orthopedics Department of the same Hospital.
From them, 18 (Group A) had osteosarcoma, 7 (Group B) osteomyelitis and 3 (Group 
C) bone fractures. The final diagnosis was made after fine needle aspiration
biopsy. All patients were subjected to the 99mTc(V)-DMSA scan, the standard bone 
scan (99mTc-MDP) and CT scan. Group A patients showed a selective uptake of
99mTc(V)-DMSA in the primary tumor region. No abnormal 99mTc(V)-DMSA uptake was
observed in the patients of Groups B and C. The 99mTc(V)-DMSA scan was found to
be superior to the 99mTc-MDP and the CT scans in identifying metastases of
osteosarcoma. Sensitivity was 100%, 86% and 98% respectively.

This work is part of an effort to develop chelating agents for stable binding and
easy conjugation of Re-188 to biologically interesting structures. Starting from 
the well-known in vivo stability of [(188)ReO(DMSA)(2)](-), we want to exploit
this coordination system for the design of (188)ReO(V) chelates, which are stable
toward reoxidation to perrhenate and toward ligand exchange under all conditions 
of radiopharmaceutical development. Therefore, a new type of tetradentate ligand 
has been synthesized by bridging two molecules of
N,N'-diisobutyl-2,3-dimercaptosuccinamide with
N-(3-aminopropyl)propane-1,3-diamine. The resulting stereoisomeric tetrathiolato 
S(4) ligand of composition
((i)()Bu)(2)N(O)C-C(SH)-C(SH)-C(O)NH-(CH(2))(3)-NH-(CH(2))(3)-NHC(O)-C(SH)-C(SH)-
C(O)N((i)Bu)(2) forms anionic five-coordinate oxorhenium(V) complexes by a
ligand-exchange reaction of NBu(4)[ReOCl(4)] in methanol. In the absence of a
base, the compounds were isolated as "betaine", [ReO(S(4))], with the protonated 
nitrogen of the bridge serving as an internal "counterion". Two representatives
have been fully characterized in both the solid and solution states and found to 
adopt the expected square-pyramidal coordination geometry. The equatorial plane
is formed by four thiolate sulfur atoms, whereas the oxygen occupies the apical
position. The orientation of the metal oxo group is exo in relation to the
carbamido groups in both isomers. Both complexes are stereoisomeric regarding the
junction of the triamine chain.

BACKGROUND: Lead poisoning is rare. Intake of lead shots may cause damage of the 
bone marrow, the nervous system, the liver, the kidneys and the endocrine organs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present two patients who had taken approximately 120
grams of lead shots. They developed asthenia, nausea and abdominal pain. We tried
to remove the lead shots with fluids, laxatives and colonoscopy, but ultimately
surgical intervention had to be performed. The patients were also treated with
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).
RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Although DMSA treatment is associated with a
significant decrease in blood lead concentration and an increase of lead urinary 
excretion, surgical intervention is the most efficient way of treating oral
intake of lead. Treatment with DMSA will probably have to go on for months in
order to give an additional effect.

Toxicokinetics of mercury elimination by succimer in twin toddlers.

Fayez I(1), Paiva M, Thompson M, Verjee Z, Koren G.

(1)Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, The Hospital for Sick
Children and The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

We describe the toxicokinetics of mercury in two twin toddlers poisoned by an
East Indian remedy for teething. Succimer (dimercaprosuccinic acid, DMSA)
decreased the plasma elimination half-life of mercury by 3-fold in the patient
with high exposure; a more modest effect was observed in the other twin. Succimer
is a chelation agent used in the treatment of heavy metal intoxication. A
water-soluble agent, it increases the urinary excretion of lead and mercury. The 
drug is rapidly but variably absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, with
peak levels occurring at 1-2 hours. After its absorption, peak mercury excretion 
through the urine occurs within 2-4 hours. In the poisoned twin sisters, succimer
administration led to a mercury plasma elimination half-life of 6 weeks. Although
succimer has been used in mercury poisoning in adults and children, the
toxicokinetics of mercury have not previously been characterized in either age
group. We believe this is the first such description. More studies on the
toxicokinetics and dynamics of mercury chelation with succimer in young children 
are needed to ensure the optimal use of the drug in this population.

Differential Effects of Dimethylsulfoniopropionate, Dimethylsulfonioacetate, and 
Other S-Methylated Compounds on the Growth of Sinorhizobium meliloti at Low and
High Osmolarities.

Electrosynthèse Organiques 3, UMR CNRS 6510, Université de Rennes 1, Rennes,
France.

An extract from the marine alga Ulva lactuca was highly osmoprotective in
salt-stressed cultures of Sinorhizobium meliloti 102F34. This beneficial activity
was due to algal 3-dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which was accumulated as a 
dominant compatible solute and strongly reduced the accumulation of endogenous
osmolytes in stressed cells. Synthetic DMSP also acted as a powerful
osmoprotectant and was accumulated as a nonmetabolizable cytosolic osmolyte (up
to a concentration of 1,400 nmol/mg of protein) throughout the growth cycles of
the stressed cultures. In contrast, 2-dimethylsulfonioacetate (DMSA), the
sulfonium analog of the universal osmoprotectant glycine betaine (GB), was highly
toxic to unstressed cells and was not osmoprotective in stressed cells of
wild-type strains of S. meliloti. Nonetheless, the transport and accumulation of 
DMSA, like the transport and accumulation of DMSP and GB, were osmoregulated and 
increased fourfold in stressed cells of strain 102F34. Strikingly, DMSA was not
toxic and became highly osmoprotective in mutants that are impaired in their
ability to demethylate GB and DMSA. Furthermore, 2-methylthioacetate and
thioglycolic acid (TGA), the demethylation products of DMSA, were excreted,
apparently as a mechanism of cellular detoxification. Also, exogenous TGA and
DMSA displayed similar inhibitory effects in strain 102F34. Thus, on the basis of
these findings and other physiological and biochemical evidence, we infer that
the toxicity of DMSA in wild-type strains of S. meliloti stems from its
catabolism via the GB demethylation pathway. This is the first report describing 
the toxicity of DMSA in any organism and a metabolically stable osmoprotectant
(DMSP) in S. meliloti.

The effects of chelating drugs used clinically as antidotes to metal toxicity are
reviewed. Human exposure to a number of metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury,
manganese, aluminum, iron, copper, thallium, arsenic, chromium, nickel and
platinum may lead to toxic effects, which are different for each metal. Similarly
the pharmacokinetic data, clinical use and adverse effects of most of the
chelating drugs used in human metal poisoning are also different for each
chelating drug. The chelating drugs with worldwide application are dimercaprol
(BAL), succimer (meso-DMSA), unithiol (DMPS), D-penicillamine (DPA),
N-acetyl-D-penicillamine (NAPA), calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate
(CaNa(2)EDTA), calcium trisodium or zinc trisodium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate
(CaNa(3)DTPA, ZnNa(3)DTPA), deferoxamine (DFO), deferiprone (L1),
triethylenetetraamine (trientine), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and Prussian blue
(PB). Several new synthetic homologues and experimental chelating agents have
been designed and tested in vivo for their metal binding effects. These include
three groups of synthetic chelators, namely the polyaminopolycarboxylic acids
(EDTA and DTPA), the derivatives of BAL (DMPS, DMSA and mono- and dialkylesters
of DMSA) and the carbodithioates. Many factors have been shown to affect the
efficacy of the chelation treatment in metal poisoning. Within this context it
has been shown in experiments using young and adult animals that metal toxicity
and chelation effects could be influenced by age. These findings may have a
bearing in the design of new therapeutic chelation protocols for metal toxicity.

BACKGROUND/AIM: To determine the incidence of abnormal Technetium Tc 99m
Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (Tc99m DMSA) renal scintigraphy findings in the children 
with urinary tract infection (UTI), and to evaluate the difference between the
children with UTI and vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR), and the children with UTI
without VUR.
METHODS: Tc99m DMSA renal scintigraphy was performed in 170 children with UTI,
mean age 7.07 years (1 month to 14 years, 137 were girls and 33 were boys). In 88
of the children, VUR was proved by micturating cystouretherography (MCU), while
in 82 VUR could not be detected by MCU. VUR was graded in accordance with MCU
recommended by the intemational study of VUR. In 13 of the children the grade of 
VUR was grade I, in 30 was grade II, in 23 grade III, in 17 grade IV, while the
grade V was in 5 of the children. Findings of Tc99m DMSA renal scintigraphy were 
classified as: 1--normal, 2--probably normal, 3--equivocal, 4--probably abnormal,
and 5--abnormal. The degree of the significance of the difference of the findings
was estimated using chi2, taking p < 0.01 as the limit of statistical
significance.
RESULTS: Of the total number of 170 studied children, the abnormal findings were 
detected in 30% (51/170), normal findings in 62% (106/170), and equivocal in 8%
(13/170). In the children with UTI and VUR, the incidence of abnormal findings
was 49% (43/88), of normal 43% (38/88), and of equivocal findings 8% (7/88). All 
the children with VUR grade V had the abnormal findings (the incidence of the
abnormal findings was 100%). In the children with VUR grade IV, the abnormal
findings were 71%. In the children with VUR grade I, 77% of the findings were
normal, in the children with VUR grade II 53% of the findings were normal and in 
the children with VUR grade III, 30% otfthe findings of renal scintigraphy were
normal. In the children with UTI without VUR, the incidence of abnormal findings 
was 10% (8/82), of normal findings 83% (68/82), and of equivocal findings 7%
(6/82). The incidence of abnormal findings was significantly higher in the
children with UTI and VUR than in those with UTI without VUR (p < 0.01). Also,
the incidence of the abnormal findings was higher in the children with VUR grades
IV and V than in the children with VUR grade I (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: DMSA renal scintigraphy in the children with ITU revealed the
abnormal findings in 30% of the cases. The incidence of the abnormallfindings was
signficantly higher when VUR was present, as well as if the grade of VUR was
higher. Our results confirmed that Tc99m DMSA renal scintigraphy was a very
important technique in the evaluation of the children with ITU.

In Europe, 1.7 % of children with predicted nephroblastoma undergo neoadjuvant
chemotherapy without being correctly diagnosed. It is necessary to reduce the
number of misdiagnoses. In a girl who was referred to our institute with the
diagnosis of nephroblastoma of the right kidney, DMSA scan revealed a
hypertrophic compensation of the contralateral nephropathy in the lower part.
Functional imaging studies of the kidney should be performed in patients in whom 
the type of pathology of a suspect mass in the kidney region is unclear,
including a careful scrutiny of the MRI scan.

BACKGROUND: Many studies have demonstrated that dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy is the most sensitive diagnostic method in the identification of
irreversible renal lesions (scars) in children with previous episodes of acute
pyelonephritis (APN). This study assessed the reliability of ultrasound in
identifying reflux nephropathy in children with acute pyelonephritis with or
without vesicoureteric reflux (VUR).
METHODS: Eighty children (45 female and 35 male, age range 5 months to 10 years, 
average age 2 years 1 month) with a positive history for at least one episode of 
APN participated in this study. All children underwent voiding
cystourethrography, DMSA scintigraphy 4 to 8 months after the most recent episode
of APN, and an ultrasound test evaluation less than 2 months after DMSA
scintigraphy.
RESULTS: Voiding cystourethrograms showed VUR in 52 children (68%); 13 of these
were bilateral, for a total of 65 refluxing kidney units of the 154 (42%)
evaluated; DMSA scintigram was normal for 108 of 154 kidneys (70%). Of the 65
kidneys with VUR, DMSA scintigram displayed normal findings in 29 cases (45%) and
pathologic findings in 36 (55%). In the 79 nonrefluxing kidneys, DMSA scintigram 
was normal in 69 cases (87%). The relative risk of scarring in VUR kidneys is
2.6. The ultrasound study recorded a maximum longitudinal diameter between the
5th and 95th percentiles in 80 of 89 (81%) kidneys without VUR and in 21 of 65
(32%) with VUR. A significant correlation was found between maximum longitudinal 
diameters and DMSA scintigraphic findings in kidneys with VUR and those without
VUR, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study establishes that ultrasound scans, by means of a simple
and reproducible measurement technique, maximum longitudinal diameter, have a
predictive value with regard to the presence of scars, with few exceptions. This 
finding, in our opinion, could lead to a decrease in the number of invasive
procedures, in particular DMSA scan, in patients with APN.

Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, M.G., Brazil.

The purpose of this study was to report the clinical course of medium-long-term
follow-up of children with prenatally detected vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
Between 1986 and 2004, 53 (41 males) children with VUR detected by investigation 
of prenatal hydronephrosis were followed up for a mean time of 66 months (range: 
6-200 months). Newborns were investigated by ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram
(VCUG) and DMSA scan. Follow-up clinical visits were performed at 6-month
intervals. After 24 months patients were investigated by conventional VCUG or
direct isotope cystogram. Survival analysis was performed in order to evaluate
the resolution of the reflux. Differences between subgroups (mild vs
moderate/severe reflux) were assessed by the two-sided log rank test. Thirty
(58%) infants presented bilateral VUR, for a total of 83 renal units. There was a
predominance of severe reflux (54%). Renal damage was detected in 33.7% of the
units on first renal scan. There was a significant correlation between severe
reflux and renal damage scars (RR=3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8,
p=0.002). Forty-seven patients were treated with continuous prophylaxis. One
patient developed systolic hypertension. Urinary tract infection occurred in 12
(25%) children conservatively managed. VUR resolution was evaluated in 56 renal
units. Spontaneous resolution was observed in 25 units (45%). At 48 months after 
diagnosis, 75% of the cases of mild reflux (I-III) and 37% of severe reflux
(IV-V) had resolved (log-rank, 5.6, p=0.017). There was an improvement of
nutritional parameters between admission and the end of follow-up. In conclusion,
the clinical course of prenatally detected VUR followed up on a medium-long-term 
basis is relatively benign. Our study corroborates the results obtained in other 
series of infants with reflux that emphasized the heterogeneity of this disorder.

Clinical evaluation of a lead mobilization test using the chelating agent
dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Author information: 
(1)Unit of Industrial Toxicology and Occupational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, 
Catholic University of Louvain, Brussels, Belgium. hoet@toxi.ucl.ac.be

BACKGROUND: The lead mobilization test reflects the mobilizable and likely
toxicologically active fraction of the lead body burden. We propose a safe and
convenient protocol for this test, to assess concomitant copper and zinc
excretion and to determine the size of the chelatable lead pool in
nonoccupationally exposed adults.
METHODS: The study population included 80 white adults: 40 controls [median blood
lead concentration (PbB), 25 microg/L] and 40 lead-exposed individuals (315
microg/L). After collection of 4- and 24-h baseline urine specimens and a blood
sample, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was administered orally (1 g), and
additional 4- and 24-h urine specimens were obtained. Determinants of the
chelatable urinary lead (DMSA-PbU) were traced by linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: Urinary DMSA and lead excretion peaked within 2-3 h after DMSA
administration. The amounts of DMSA, lead, copper, and zinc recovered in the 4-h 
urinary collections were highly correlated with those in 24-h collections (r =
0.857, 0.859, 0.958, and 0.757, respectively). At PbB concentrations >300
microg/L, the relationship between DMSA-PbU and PbB showed a steep increase and a
widespread dispersion of DMSA-PbU around the regression line. After DMSA, copper 
and zinc excretion rates were increased up to 91- and 33-fold, respectively. No
side effects were reported after DMSA.
CONCLUSIONS: Determination of DMSA-PbU in a 4-h collection after DMSA is
convenient, apparently safe, and inexpensive. An upper reference limit value of
22 microg/4 h is proposed for Belgian reference individuals. The diagnostic value
of DMSA-PbU is likely to be contributive for PbB >300 microg/L.

Effectiveness of diuretic injection on the measurement of differential renal
function using Tc-99m DMSA in patients with a dilated renal pelvis.

(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine,
Adana, Turkey. gulgunb@cu.edu.tr

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of diuretic
injection for the measurement of differential renal function (DRF) with
technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99m DMSA) scintigraphy in patients
with a dilated pelvis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 46 patients who were referred for both
technetium-99m-L,L-ethylenedicysteine (Tc-99m L,L-EC) and Tc-99m DMSA imaging and
found to have a dilated collecting system on Tc-99m EC scintigraphy were studied.
Four to 5 hours after intravenous injection of Tc-99m DMSA, imaging was performed
in the supine position, and posterior, anterior, left and right lateral, and left
and right posterior oblique views were taken. After this study, furosemide was
administered intravenously and 30 minutes later, additional images in the
anterior and posterior views were obtained.
RESULTS: The kidneys were evaluated into 2 groups. Group 1 comprised 12 kidneys
that had an obstructive curve pattern on Tc-99m EC scans. Group 2 comprised 34
kidneys that had a nonobstructive dilated renogram curve pattern. DRF of the
kidneys in each patient were calculated, and the values obtained from the
standard and diuretic DMSA scans were compared with each other for all patients
and each group. Considering all the patients, the values of mean DRF on both
standard and diuretic DMSA images were 55.4%+/-21.2% and 55.4%+/-21.5%,
respectively. There were no significant differences between DRF values of each
kidney obtained by the 2 methods. When we compared the DRF values in groups 1 and
2, there were again no significant differences. In group 1, the values of mean
DRF on standard and diuretic images were 51.7%+/-13.7% and 51.6%+/-13.9%,
respectively, and in group 2, the values of mean DRF were 56.7%+/-23.4% and
56.7%+/-23.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In view of our study, diuretic administration seems to be an
unnecessary intervention because it has no effect on the accuracy of DRF
measurements using DMSA scintigraphy in patients with a dilated collecting system
whether it is obstructed or not.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the adaptability and the possible advantages of the
antireflux mechanism of the serous lined extramural tunnel for ureter
re-implantation on a gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) Stapler detubularised
ileal neobladder
METHODS: From April 1998 to July 2002 43 male patients underwent radical
cystectomy and the creation of a Camey II ileal neobladder using this antireflux 
technique. Follow-up in all cases included excretory urography or T.C. scan and a
retrograde cystography at 6 months and a renal scintigraphy with DMSA at 1 year
follow-up, besides serum creatinine, blood urea and serum electrolytes every
three months and renal-neovesical ultrasound every six months.
RESULTS: Early and late complications were low. At follow-up 1 case of
neovesico-ureteral reflux and 2 cases of ureteroileal anastomotic strictures were
found. DMSA scintigraphy showed no further renal scars.
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary experience was favourable due to overall reduced
operating time (about 1 hour 45 minutes to create the orthotopic neobladder and
the ureteroileal anastomosis), simplicity of execution and a low complication
rate (6.9%) at a median follow-up of 38 months (range 12-52 months).

Microbial dimethylsulfoxide and trimethylamine-N-oxide respiration.

McCrindle SL(1), Kappler U, McEwan AG.

Author information: 
(1)School of Molecular and Microbial Sciences, The University of Queensland,
Brisbane 4072, Australia.

Over the last two decades, the biochemistry and genetics of dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) respiration has been characterised,
particularly in Escherichia coli marine bacteria of the genus Shewanella and the 
purple phototrophic bacteria, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and R. capsulatus. All of
the enzymes (or catalytic subunits) involved the final step in DMSO and TMAO
respiration contain a pterin molybdenum cofactor and are members of the DMSO
reductase family of molybdoenzymes. In E. coli, the dimethylsulfoxide reductase
(DmsABC) can be purified from membranes as a complex, which exhibits quinol-DMSO 
oxidoreductase activity. The enzyme is anchored to the membrane via the DmsC
subunit and its catalytic subunit DmsA is now considered to face the periplasm.
Electron transfer to DmsA involves the DmsB subunit, which is a polyferredoxin
related to subunits found in other molybdoenzymes such as nitrate reductase and
formate dehydrogenase. A characteristic of the DmsAB-type DMSO reductase is its
ability to reduce a variety of S- and N-oxides. E. coli contains a
trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (TorA) that is highly specific for N-oxides.
This enzyme is located in the periplasm and is connected to the quinone pool via 
a membrane-bound penta-haem cytochrome (TorC). DorCA in purple phototrophic
bacteria of the genus Rhodobacter is very similar to TorCA with the critical
difference that DorA catalyses reduction of both DMSO and TMAO. It is known as a 
DMSO reductase because the S-oxide is the best substrate. Crystal structures of
DorA and TorA have revealed critical differences at the Mo active site that may
explain the differences between substrate specificity between the two enzymes.
DmsA, TorA and DorA possess a "twin arginine" N-terminal signal sequence
consistent with their secretion via the TAT secretory system and not the Sec
system. The enzymes are secreted with their bound prosthetic groups: this take
place in the cytoplasm and the biogenesis involves a chaperone protein, which is 
cognate for each enzyme. Expression of the DMSO and TMAO respiratory operons is
induced in response to a fall in oxygen tension. dmsABC expression is positively 
controlled by the oxygen-responsive transcription factor, Fnr and ModE, a
transcription factor that binds molybdate. In contrast, torCAD expression is not 
under Fnr- or ModE-control but is dependent upon a sensor histidine
kinase-response regulator pair, TorSR, which activate gene expression under
conditions of low oxygen tension in the presence of N- or S-oxide. Regulation of 
dorCDA expression is similar to that seen for torCAD but it appears that the
expression of the sensor histidine kinase-response regulator pair, DorSR is
regulated by Fnr and there is an additional tier of regulation involving the
ModE-homologue MopB, molybdate and the transcription factor DorX. Analysis of
microbial genomes has revealed the presence of dms and tor operons in a wide
variety of bacteria and in some archaea and duplicate dms and tor operons have
been identified in E. coli. Challenges ahead will include the determination of
the significance of the presence of the dms operon in bacterial pathogens and the
determination of the significance of DMSO respiration in the global turnover of
marine organo-sulfur compounds.

PURPOSE: The study aimed to quantitatively investigate the effect of PCNL on
global and regional function using quantitative single photon emission
computerized tomography (SPECT) measurement of Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) 
uptake by the kidneys (QDMSA).
METHODS: Seventy nine patients with nephrolithiasis undergoing PCNL were studied 
by sequential QDMSA examination. There were 42 (53%) males and 37 (47%) females
with mean age of 47 +/- 16 years. The initial study was conducted before PCNL
procedure and the follow-up studies were performed 1.5-24 months after PCNL.
Among 60 of the 79 (76%) patients, in whom PCNL was performed using upper or
lower pole access, regional renal function of affected and non-affected pole of
operated kidney was calculated separately.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the uptake of 
treated kidney before and after PCNL procedure (11.9% +/- 5% vs 11.6% +/- 5%; t =
0.9, p = 0.368). The total renal functional volume of treated kidney was to be
slightly decreased from 235cc +/- 62cc to 224cc +/- 59cc (t = 2.7; p = 0.011).
The percent of injected dose per ml.. of renal tissue of treated kidney was not
affected statistically (0.051 +/- 0.02 vs 0.053 +/- 0.02; t = 0.86, p = 0.296).
In the assessment of the regional renal function of treated kidney, a
statistically significant decrease in the functional renal volume was revealed at
the part which underwent PCNL procedure (91cc +/- 30cc vs 82cc +/- 27cc; t =
2.64, p = 0.013). Regarding percent of injected dose per ml. of renal tissue, no 
statistically significant difference was found between the part of treated
kidney, which underwent PCNL and non-affected area of the same kidney (0.049 +/- 
0.02 vs 0.05 +/- 0.02; t = 0.693, p = 0.494). The function of contralateral
kidney remained unchanged (13.4% +/- 5.2% vs 13.6% +/- 4.8%; t = 0.68, p = 0.5). 
Function volume, neither total percent uptake, nor percent of injected dose per
ml. of renal tissue were reduced significantly. Further studies with long term
follow-up of treated kidney are required.

Reference ranges for 51Cr-EDTA measurements of glomerular filtration rate in
children.

Medicine, Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, UK. glen.blake@kcl.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: 51Cr-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA) is widely used to
measure the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in children and adults.
AIM: To produce paediatric reference data for use with the British Nuclear
Medicine Society (BNMS) GFR guidelines.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of children and adolescents, aged 0-17
years, undergoing combined 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA)
scintigraphy and GFR examination. GFR was evaluated from Cr-EDTA plasma clearance
using blood samples taken at 2, 3 and 4 h according to the methods set out in the
BNMS GFR guidelines. 99mTc-DMSA images were reviewed to identify children with
normal scans.
RESULTS: Of the 45 children having a combined 99mTc-DMSA and GFR investigation,
27 (12 females, 15 males) had a normal scan result. The mean GFR (standard
deviation) in the 24 subjects aged 2-17 years was 109.5 (16.8) ml . min(-1) .
(1.73 m2)(-1). This compared with a predicted figure of 107.0 (17.0) ml . min(-1)
. (1.73 m2)(-1) when the paediatric reference range published by Piepsz et al.
was adjusted to be consistent with the BNMS GFR guidelines. When the GFR results 
in the present study were calculated according to the single-sample and
two-sample methods used by Piepsz et al., there was close agreement with the
results obtained in the latter study [116.7 (24.2) vs. 114.7 (25.8) ml . min(-1) 
. (1.73 m2)(-1)]. Children with abnormal 99mTc-DMSA scans had significantly lower
GFR than those with normal scans (P=0.003).
CONCLUSION: There is a consistent difference between the GFR results in children 
with normal 99mTc-DMSA scans obtained in the present study and the unadjusted
results of Piepsz et al. that can be explained by the different methods of
calculating GFR in the two studies. Given the larger number of children in the
latter study, it is proposed that centres evaluating GFR according to the BNMS
method should adopt the Piepsz et al. reference range adjusted for consistency
with the BNMS guidelines. This gives a mean GFR (SD) in children of 2 years and
over of 107 (17) ml . min(-1) . (1.73 m2)(-1).

Global gene expression analysis revealed an unsuspected deo operon under the
control of molybdate sensor, ModE protein, in Escherichia coli.

ModE protein, a molybdate sensor/regulator, controls the transcription of genes
coding for molybdate uptake (mod), molybdopterin synthesis (moa), molybdoenzymes 
nitrate reductase (nap) and dimethylsulfoxide reductase (dms), as well as
fermentative dihydrogen production (fdhF and hyc) and respiratory nitrate
reductase (narXL) in Escherichia coli. The catalytic product of a second protein,
MoeA, is also required for molybdate-dependent positive regulation of hyc and nar
operons. To explore the potential role of ModE and MoeA in the regulation of
other E. coli genes, the global gene expression profile of a wild type and a
modE, moeA double mutant grown in glucose-minimal medium under anaerobic
conditions were compared. Expression of 67 genes was affected by the modE and
moeA mutations (P value <0.01). Of these, 17 differed by at least 2-fold or
higher. Fourteen genes were expressed at a higher level in the mutant (2.4- to
23.9-fold) (notably, mod-molybdate transport, deo-nucleoside catabolism and
opp-oligopeptide transport operons) and dmsA and yli operon were expressed at a
higher level in the wild type parent (2.6- to 5.7-fold). One of the unexpected
findings was repression of the deo operon by ModE. This was confirmed by
quantitative RT-PCR and by the analysis of a deoC-lacZ fusion. The deo
promoter/operator region contains a putative ModE-consensus sequence centered at 
-35 in which the adenines are replaced by guanines (TGTGT-N7-TGTGT). The ModE
protein did bind to the deo upstream DNA and shifted its electrophoretic
mobility. Bioinformatics analysis of the E. coli genome for ModE-consensus motif 
(TATAT-N7-TAYAT) identified 21 additional genes/operons including the moa as
potential targets for Mo-control. The physiological role of many of the genes
identified solely by bioinformatics (19/21) is unknown. Expression levels of
these genes were similar in the parent and the isogenic modE, moeA mutant when
cultured anaerobically in glucose-minimal medium. This study identified
additional targets, such as deo and opp, for the Mo-dependent control in E. coli.

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of different techniques in
the diagnostic workup of children with negative prenatal ultrasonogram, referred 
for urinary tract infection (UTI) within the first 24 months.
METHODS: One-hundred and forty-seven patients, 71 males/76 females were studied. 
All patients were submitted to renal ultrasonogram (RUS) and to micturating
cystourethrogram (MCU) independently from the results of RUS. In a small group
(48 children) DMSA scan was performed independently from the results of RUS and
MCU. Sensitivity and predictive value of RUS for vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) were
estimated. Multiple regression analysis was performed on a selected number of
signs to evaluate their predictive value. The group investigated by DMSA scan was
analysed to evaluate how the presence of VUR on MCU anticipated renal damage.
RESULTS: Nineteen (21%) patients with normal RUS, had VUR. Predictive value of
RUS (0.21) was influenced by the grade of the VUR but more than 30% of high grade
refluxing renal units appeared normal at initial ultrasonography. DMSA scan was
abnormal in 27% of 48 patients; its result was independent from the presence of
VUR of whatever grade.
CONCLUSIONS: The increasing number of renal abnormalities detected before birth
reduces the possibility of late abnormal RUS findings. It makes RUS screening for
abnormalities, after a first episode of UTI, scarcely useful. VUR may be easily
missed when RUS resulted normal and MCU is omitted. Negative MCU cannot exclude
renal damage in presence of UTI. Renal defects at DMSA scan may be unrelated to a
demonstrable VUR and could have a different pathogenesis.

An easy and gentle method for the preparation of 188Re(V) complexes with
bidentate and tetradentate ligands is described starting from the precursor
complex 188Re(III)-EDTA. That complex is prepared at room temperature in acidic
solution and reacts by a combined re-oxidation/ligand exchange reaction with
appropriate ligands like DMSA or ECD (DMSA = dimercapto succinic acid, ECD =
L,L-ethylene dicysteine diethyl ester) or en, tau, and cyclam (en = ethylene
diamine, tau = 1,4,8,11-tetraazaundecane, cyclam =
1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclo-tetradecane) to the 188Re(V)-oxo- and dioxocomplexes,
respectively. The chelates were unambiguously identified by chromatographic
comparison with spectroscopically characterised samples or known 99mTc-kit
reconstitutions. The reaction succeeds under mild conditions (room temperature,
short time, neutral or weak basic solutions) with high yields and has potential
for labelling of sensitive biomolecules with 188Re.

We investigated the effects of dimercaprol (BAL), meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) and 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulphonic acid (DMPS) on human blood
delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (delta-ALA-D) activity, the most reliable
indicator of lead intoxication in humans, in the presence of lead in vitro.
Furthermore, we studied the effects of the chelating agents, administered
subcutaneously, on delta-ALA-D activity in blood and tissues of mice submitted to
sub-acute lead exposure (50 mg/kg for 15 consecutive days, subcutaneously). In
vitro results demonstrated that human blood delta-ALA-D activity was
significantly inhibited (62%) by lead acetate. Lead acetate (1-1000 microM)
pre-incubated with human blood increased the inhibitory potency of this compound 
on delta-ALA-D when compared to the assay without pre-incubation (89%). Chelating
agents caused a marked potentiation of delta-ALA-D inhibition induced by lead, in
vitro. One of the most notable observations in the present study was the
correspondence between in vitro and ex vivo effects. In fact, BAL and DMPS
increase the inhibitory effect of lead on delta-ALA-D activity from mice blood.
The complexes formed (lead and chelators) were more inhibitory than lead alone in
kidney and liver enzyme activity, ex vivo.

We present a patient with left-sided obstructed megaureter secondary to
neuropathic bladder. He was referred for technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid
((99m)Tc-DMSA) renal cortical scintigraphy to evaluate renal cortical function.
Images obtained 4 hr after injection showed significant activity in the dilated
left ureter. When the ureter is visualized on DMSA scan, obstructive megaureter
should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

A 59-year-old woman with a history of chronic pyelonephritis underwent a renal
scintiscan with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA). Images
showed substantially hypofunctional small left kidney. A large oval extrarenal
uptake area above the urine bladder was also seen. An iv X-ray urography showed
at the same area a spacious "shadow". A computerized tomography showed a very
large uterus, sized 19 x 10 cm, with myomatous nodes, calcifications and
disintegration cavities. Hysterectomy and bilateral adnexotomy were performed.
Histopathology showed a myomatous uterus with an adenocarcinoma which also
affected both ovaria. External radiotherapy followed.

Author information: 
(1)Wu Song Centre Hospital, Shanghai 200940, China.

OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of controlling of house dusts in attacks of mite
sensitive asthmatics (DMSA).
METHODS: Dust in mattresses, sofas, beddings and pillows were calculated for 43
cases of DMSA every season meanwhile the asthmatic symptoms, amount of drugs
taken, PEF value in morning and evening were daily recorded by patients, then the
patients were divided into two groups i.e. treatment group (A group, 22 cases)
and no treatment group ( B group, 21 cases) randomly. The controlling measures
included well-ventilation, washing clothes and bedclothes and catching dust
frequently and exposing of clothing or bedclothes in the sun.
RESULTS: Correlation was found between house dust density and asthmatic attacks. 
The number of dust mites was lower after treatment than before in A group [(N/g):
spring 62 vs 103, summer 105 vs 132, autumn 163 vs 231, winter 9 vs 13].
Concomitant asthmatic symptoms and amount of drugs taken and total IgE reduced
[(0.6 vs 1.6) mg/L] and PEF values or PEF difference improved.
CONCLUSION: Control of dust mites growth could alleviate the asthmatic symptoms
and decrease the attacks.

Poly(lactic-co glycolic)acid (75:25) (PLGA) microspheres for the delivery of a
radiation dose to tumors were synthesized after loading the 188Re(V) labeled
DMSA. The 188ReO4- in place of 99mTcO4- was replaced to label DMSA, because of
their structural and chemical similarities and to make the molecule site specific
for radiotherapy. The radiolabeling efficiency of DMSA was more than 97% as
confirmed by ITLC. A solvent evaporation technique was used to encapsulate DMSA
in PLGA microspheres. Electron microscopy demonstrated the microspheres size
ranged between 0.4-1.8 microm. As demonstrated by DSC, DMSA was encapsulated
(20-30%) within the microspheres in solid solution, metastable molecular
dispersion or crystallization forms. In vitro release studies confirmed the
stability of DMSA.

AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (A1166C) gene polymorphisms were 
associated with the renal scar formation secondary to recurrent urinary tract
infection in children without uropathy.
METHODS: The polymorphisms were investigated by polymerase chain reaction in 97
children (81 females, 16 males; age, 2.5-13 years) with recurrent urinary tract
infection and 100 healthy controls as a single centre study. Children with
vesicoureteral reflux, bladder dysfunction and other uropathies were excluded.
The dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan performed at least 3 months after a
proven urinary tract infection and the result of the last DMSA was taken into
consideration.
RESULTS: Renal scarring was found in 30 patients (30.9%) using DMSA scan. The
number of urinary tract infection attacks was significantly higher in patients
with renal scarring compared with children without scarring (P<0.05). The
follow-up period and male/female ratio of patients with or without renal scarring
was similar (P>0.05). Age at the first urinary tract infection was lower in the
group with scarring. The ACE insertion/deletion genotype distribution and D
allele frequency were similar between patients and controls (P>0.05), and in
patients with renal scarring and those without renal scarring. Also, the
angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene polymorphism was not associated with renal
parenchymal damage (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the ACE insertion/deletion and angiotensin
II type 1 receptor gene polymorphisms were not independent risk factors for renal
scar formation in recurrent urinary tract infection of paediatric patients
without uropathy.

Diagnosing symptomatic urinary tract infections in infants by catheter urine
culture.

Cheng YW(1), Wong SN.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong
Kong, China.

BACKGROUND: Diagnosing infantile urinary tract infection (UTI) is difficult due
to contamination during urine collection. Catheterization is convenient but
diagnostic criteria (colony-forming units per millilitre (CFU/mL)) is
controversial, especially in uncircumcised males.
OBJECTIVES: To study the value of catheter urine cultures in terms of likelihood 
ratios (LRs), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values
of different CFU/mL in uncircumcised boys and girls.
METHODS: Infants aged 1-18 months who had catheter urine cultures from July 1999 
to June 2002 were reviewed to decide if they had symptomatic UTI (group A) or not
(group B). Urinary tract infection was confirmed if patients had a positive urine
culture plus acute fever, pyuria, positive leucocyte esterase and nitrite tests
and good response to antibiotics, with pyelonephritic evidence on early
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans in doubtful cases. Group B included infants 
with negative urine culture results, and those with positive results but were
asymptomatic and admitted for micturating cystourethrogram.
RESULTS: Nine hundred and fifty-two patients were studied (492 boys, 460 girls;
212 in group A, 740 in group B). No single cut-off CFU/mL has high sensitivity
and specificity to simultaneously diagnose and exclude UTI. The CFU counts of
100-10(3), 10(3)-10(4), 10(4)-10(5) and >10(5) were associated with LRs of 0.11, 
0.45, 1.52 and 20.5, respectively in uncircumcised boys, and with LRs of 1.39,
2.49, 8.95 and 18.8, respectively in girls. The LR for mixed growths was 0.21.
CONCLUSION: Unlike suprapubic tap urine, catheter urine culture has to be
interpreted against the clinical context or pretest probability and in terms of
probability. In the scenario of a febrile infant where the pretest probability of
UTI was about 5%, UTI was highly likely if counts exceeded 10(5)/mL, and unlikely
if counts were below 10(4)/mL in uncircumcised boys. In female infants, UTI was
highly likely if counts were >10(4) CFU/mL, but lower counts could not exclude
UTI.

This prospective study was done to assess the frequency of acute pyelonephritis
(APN) in febrile children with positive urine culture as documented by Tc99m DMSA
scintigraphy (DMSA) and the frequency of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in these
children. Secondly, to determine the frequency of APN, in febrile children with
supportive evidence for UTI but with negative urine culture, as documented by
DMSA and frequency of VUR in them. Thirdly to stress the utility of DMSA to
diagnose APN in urine culture negative febrile children and to suggest DMSA as a 
clinical tool in evaluation of fever of unknown origin (FUO). This study included
42 children with positive urine culture and 26 children with negative urine
culture who had supportive evidence of UTI as determined by the predetermined
criteria and diagnosed to have APN by DMSA. All of them had ultrasonogram (USG), 
DMSA and voiding cystourethrogram (VCU). They were followed up for a minimum
period of 6 months. Out of the 42 children with positive urine culture 92.9% had 
features of APN in the DMSA of whom 82.1% had vesicoureteric relux (VUR). The
DMSA was abnormal in 26 children with negative urine culture, of whom 65.4% had
VUR. Ultrasound suggestive of parenchymal change was observed in 47.6% in the
culture positive group and 65.4% in the culture negative group. In conclusion, it
is suggested, that DMSA is a useful investigation for the diagnosis of APN in
febrile UTI. DMSA is indicated in febrile children with negative urine culture
but with supportive evidence of UTI and in FUO. An abnormal DMSA is a strong
indication for work up for VUR.

    Nat Clin Pract Nephrol. 2006 Apr;2(4):194-5.

It is generally believed that infants are more susceptible to development of
renal scarring after pyelonephritis than children over 5 years old. This view has
led to differences in investigations and treatment according to age. The aim of
this prospective study was to assess the occurrence of renal parenchymal lesion
in children over 5 years admitted with a first-time symptomatic urinary tract
infection (UTI). Between October 2000 and April 2002, 52 children aged over 5
years who were admitted to our department with probable acute pyelonephritis
(APN) and a positive urine culture were included in this study. All children
received antibiotics for 14 days. During the acute phase of infection,
scintigraphy with technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and
ultrasonography (US) were done. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed
in all children early in the course of the illness, generally within 5-7 days of 
hospitalization. When scintigraphy showed renal parenchymal changes, repeat
scintigraphy was done after at least 3 months to assess the progression of renal 
abnormalities. Of the 52 children with a first-time documented pyelonephritis,
cortical scintigraphy showed renal lesion in 41 children (78.8%). US was normal
in all children with normal renal scintigraphy, while it detected renal
abnormalities in 16 of the 41 (39 %) with abnormal scintigraphy (p <0.0001).
Topographic analysis of the 165 focal lesions showed that 42.4% were localized to
the upper poles, 17.5% to the middle third, and 40% to the lower poles of the
kidneys. Repeat scintigraphy showed persistent lesions corresponding to those on 
the initial scan in nine (28.2%) of the 32 children. Renal lesions had partly
regressed in 23 (71.8%) of the patients who underwent repeat scintigraphy.
Vesicoureteral reflux was observed in 13.4% of kidneys and renal parenchymal
abnormalities were identified in 71.4% and 72.2% of renal units, respectively,
with and without reflux ( p >0.05). In conclusion, our data did not confirm the
conventional opinion that the risk of renal scarring after pyelonephritis is low 
in children over the age of 5 years. Our findings suggest that renal scintigraphy
may be a more appropriate method of investigation than VCUG for evaluation of the
children over 5 years with acute pyelonephritis. Additionally, the frequency of
scintigraphic changes is high, and a strategy based exclusively on ultrasound
findings would miss about 61% of the abnormal renal units. We recommend that all 
children, irrespective of age, will benefit from further investigations that
might prevent or limit the development of scarring process and renal
complications.

This prospective study, performed in 76 children with a urinary tract infection
(UTI), evaluates the diagnostic value of procalcitonin (PCT) and proinflammatory 
cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) in children with acute pyelonephritis
documented by dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA). Renal parenchymal
involvement was assessed by (99m )Tc-DMSA scintigraphy within 7 days of
admission. The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis was confirmed only in patients
with reversible lesions on scintigraphy. According to DMSA scan results, patients
were divided into two groups, lower UTI or acute pyelonephritis. In acute
pyelonephritis, serum PCT level was found to be significantly higher than it is
in the lower UTI (p <0.001). Also, significantly higher serum proinflammatory
cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) levels were detected in those with acute
pyelonephritis than those with lower UTI (p <0.001). We conclude that both serum 
PCT and proinflammatory cytokine levels may be used as accurate markers for
diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis.

Combining SPECT medical imaging and computational fluid dynamics for analyzing
blood and dialysate flow in hemodialyzers.

For a better insight in dialyzer efficiency with respect to local mass transport 
in a low flux dialyzer (Fresenius F6HPS), blood and dialysate flow distributions 
were visualized with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations, which were
validated with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. To
visualize blood-side flow while avoiding transport through the fiber membrane, a 
bolus of 99m-Technetium labeled MAA (Macro Aggregated Albumin) was injected in
the flow using an electronic valve. Water was used to simulate blood, but flow
rate was adjusted according to laws of dynamic similarity to account for the
viscosity difference (factor 2.75). For the visualization of dialysate flow, a
bolus of 99m-Technetium labeled DMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic Acid) was injected,
while pressurized air in the blood compartment avoided transmembrane flow. For
each test series, 3D acquisitions were made on a two respectively three-headed
SPECT camera. By evaluating the images at different time steps, dynamic 3D
intensity plots were obtained, which were further used to derive local flow
velocities. Additionally, three-dimensional CFD models were developed for
simulating the overall blood and dialysate flow, respectively. In both models,the
whole fiber compartment was defined as a porous medium with overall axial and
radial permeability derived theoretically and from in vitro tests. With the
imaging as well as with the computational technique, a homogeneous blood flow
distribution was found, while vortices and fluid stagnation were observed in the 
dialyzer inlet manifold. The non-homogeneous dialysate distribution, as found
with SPECT imaging, implies the occurrence of non-efficient sites with respect to
mass transfer. The discrepancy between the dialysate results of both techniques
indicated that the assumption of a constant fiber bundle permeability in the CFD 
model was too optimistic. In conclusion, medical imaging techniques like SPECT
are very helpful to validate CFD models, which can be further applied for
dialyzer design and optimization.

Monoisoamyl dimercaptosuccinic acid induced changes in pregnant female rats
during late gestation and lactation.

Mehta A(1), Pant SC, Flora SJ.

Establishment, Jhansi Road, Gwalior 474 002, India.

Monoisoamyl dimercaptosuccinic acid (MiADMSA), a vicinal thiol chelating agent
and an analogue of a conventional metal chelating agent,
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has recently been gaining recognition to 
be more effective chelating agent than DMSA in mobilizing lead, mercury and
arsenic. However, very little information is available on the toxicological
properties of this chelator. In the present study, MiADMSA was administered to
pregnant female rats from day 14 of gestation to day 21 of lactation at different
doses through oral (p.o.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) routes to examine the
toxicity in the pups and dams. Results suggested that MiADMSA had no effect on
period of gestation, litter-size, sex ratio, and viability and lactation. No
skeletal defects were observed following the administration of the chelator.
However, MiADMSA administration produced few signs of oxidative stress in dams
particularly at the higher doses (100 and 200mg/kg) as evident from increased
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in RBCs and decrease in the
delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity. Administration of MiADMSA 
also caused some alterations in the essential metal concentration in the soft
tissues especially tissue copper loss in lactating mothers and pups, which would 
be of some concern. Apart from copper, changes were also observed in the tissue
zinc concentrations in mothers and pups following MiADMSA administration. The
study thus suggests that the chelator is relatively safe during late gestation
and it does not cause any major alteration in the mothers and the developing
pups. However, detailed studies with MiADMSA, post-toxic metal exposure in
pregnant animals may provide useful information.

Beneficial role of monoesters of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in the
mobilization of lead and recovery of tissue oxidative injury in rats.

We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) and two of its analogues, monomethyl dimercaptosuccinic acid (MmDMSA) and 
mono-cyclohexyl dimercaptosuccinic acid (MchDMSA) in reducing lead concentration 
in blood and soft tissues, and in recovering lead induced oxidative stress in
rats. Male wistar rats were exposed to lead acetate in drinking water for 20
weeks, followed by 5 days of oral treatment with DMSA (100mg/kg, oral, once
daily), MmDMSA or MchDMSA (50 and 100mg/kg). Biochemical variables indicative of 
oxidative stress along with lead, zinc and copper concentration were evaluated in
blood and other soft tissues. Exposure to lead caused a significant decrease in
blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity and glutathione (GSH)
level. These changes were accompanied by inhibition of kidney ALAD and an
increase in delta-aminolevulinic acid synthatase (ALAS) activity in liver and
kidneys. Also seen were a pronounced depletion of brain GSH, glutathione
peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and decreased superoxide
dismutase (SOD) activity and an increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive
substances (TBARS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. These biochemical
changes were correlated with an increased uptake of lead in blood and soft
tissues. Blood and kidneys zinc concentration decreased significantly following
lead exposure while, copper concentration remained unchanged. No effect of
chelation on hepatic zinc concentration was noted, only liver copper
concentration showed significant depletion on treatment with DMSA and MmDMSA
(100mg/kg). Treatment with DMSA, MmDMSA and MchDMSA provided significant recovery
in altered biochemical variables and brain DNA damage besides significant
depletion of tissue lead burden. Among the chelating agents used, MchDMSA and
MmDMSA provided better recovery in altered biochemical variables and depletion of
lead concentration in tissues compared to DMSA. The above results suggest DMSA
monoesters to be a better treatment option than DMSA in eliciting recovery to the
altered biochemical variables and in the depletion of body lead burden.

Dichlofluanid (N-dichlorofluoromethylthio-N'-dimethyl-N-phenylsulphamide) is used
as booster biocide in antifouling paints. The occurrence of dichlofluanid and its
metabolite DMSA (N'-dimethyl-N-phenyl-sulphamide) was monitored in seawater and
marine sediment from three Greek marinas. Seawater and sediment samples were
collected at three representative positions and one suspected hotspot in each
marina and shipped to the laboratory for chemical analysis. As part of the
project, an analytical method had been developed and validated. Furthermore, some
additional experiments were carried out to investigate the potential contribution
of paint particle bound dichlofluanid on the total concentration in the sediment.
As expected, given its known high hydrolytic degradation rate, no detectable
concentrations of dichlofluanid were measured in any of the seawater samples.
DMSA was detected in seawater samples at very low concentrations varying from <3 
ng l(-1) (LOD) to 36 ng l(-1). During method validation, it had already been
demonstrated that dichlofluanid is unstable in sediment and can therefore only be
determined as its metabolite DMSA. In a separate experiment, in which marine
sediment was spiked with artificial paint particles containing dichlofluanid and 
then analysed according to the validated method, it was demonstrated that if
there is any dichlofluanid originating from paint particles, this would be
determined as DMSA. No DMSA was detected in any of the sediment samples. It could
therefore be concluded that there were no significant concentrations of
dichlofluanid in the sediment samples.

Accumulation of Tc99m-DMSA-3 in the spleen in a case of multiple myeloma with
associated amyloidosis.

We describe a case of a 58-year-old male with longstanding hypertension and Type 
2 diabetes mellitus who developed sudden onset renal impairment. The first clue
to the possible presence of amyloidosis in this case was provided by the
radionuclide renal cortical scan performed with trivalent dimercapto succinic
acid (Tc99m-DMSA-3), which revealed intense tracer uptake in the spleen
suggesting amyloid deposit. Further workup to ascertain the cause of amyloidosis 
led to the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. We conclude that in cases of
extra-renal or splenic accumulation of Tc99m-DMSA-3, a diagnosis of amyloidosis
should be considered, in an appropriate clinical setting.

Health hazards caused by heavy metals have become a great concern to the
population. Arsenic as an environmental agent is considered to be a toxic
substance due to its carcinogenic potential in humans. Since arsenic compounds
might exert their toxicity by the generation of reactive oxygen species, we have 
evaluated the effect of both DL-alpha-lipoic acid (LA) and meso 2,3 dimercapto
succinic acid (DMSA) on the antioxidants and lipid peroxidation in arsenic
treated rats. The objective of the study was to determine whether DL-alpha-lipoic
acid and meso 2,3 dimercapto succinic acid could rehabitate antioxidant depletion
and damage to biomolecules in protection against oxidative insults. A significant
increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species formation and lipid
peroxidation and decrease in the activities of antioxidant enzymes were observed 
in arsenic exposed rats. Supplementation of DL-alpha-lipoic acid and meso 2,3
dimercapto succinic acid to arsenic fed rats significantly increased the
activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase with
elevation in the levels of reduced glutathione, total sulfhydryl, ascorbic acid
and alpha-tocopherol. In addition, significant decrease in the levels of reactive
oxygen species formation and lipid peroxidation was also observed in our study.
From our results, we conclude that DL-alpha-lipoic acid and meso 2,3 dimercapto
succinic acid play a synergistic role in decreasing arsenic induced oxidative
damage by elevating the antioxidant status in liver and kidney.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of renal scarring in a
group of Kuwaiti Arab children with their first documented acute pyelonephritis
(APN). Eighty-two Kuwaiti Arab children (10 males and 72 females) who had
abnormal (99m)Tc DMSA renal scan findings of acute pyelonephritis were
prospectively studied with the same imaging modality 6 months after treatment to 
identify those who developed renal scarring. A micturition cystourethrogram
(MCUG) was performed for all of the children 1 month after diagnosis. Children
were divided into 3 age groups (<2 years, 2-5 years and above 5 years). The
follow-up DMSA renal scans 6 months after diagnosis revealed normalization of
renal changes in 56% (46 patients), much improvement with residual renal
abnormality in 6% (5 patients), and persistent parenchymal defects in 38% (31
patients). Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was found in 32% of children (26/82) and
the majority were between grade I and III. Thirteen of those with VUR (50%)
developed renal scars on follow-up. Fifty-three percent of the scarred kidneys
(19/36) were drained by non-refluxing ureters. In this study, children older than
2 years had less VUR yet were more susceptible to APN and to the development of
renal scars. Girls were more prone to developing APN and renal scarring than
boys. This work shows that APN is a serious cause for renal scarring in our
patients, particularly if associated with other risk factors such as recurrent
infections and the female sex.

BACKGROUND: Childhood urinary tract infection (UTI) with or without
vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) may predispose to renal scarring. There is no clear
consensus in the literature regarding imaging following UTI in infancy.
AIMS: To define the role of cystography following a first UTI in children aged
under 1 year, when urinary tract ultrasonography (US) is normal.
METHODS: Retrospective data collection of 108 children (216 renal units) aged
under 1 year at the time of a bacteriologically proven UTI. All had a normal US
and underwent both catheter cystogram and DMSA test. Sensitivity, specificity,
likelihood ratios positive and negative, and diagnostic odds ratio were
calculated for VUR on cystography versus scarring on DMSA.
RESULTS: VUR was shown in 25 (11.6%) renal units. Scarring on DMSA was seen in 8 
(3.7 %) kidneys. Only 16% of kidneys with VUR had associated scarring; 50% of
scarred kidneys were not associated with VUR. The likelihood ratio positive was
4.95 (95% CI 2.22 to 11.05) and the likelihood ratio negative was 0.56 (95% CI
0.28 to 1.11). The diagnostic odds ratio was 8.9, suggesting that cystography
provided little additional information.
CONCLUSION: Since only 16% of children with VUR had an abnormal kidney, the
presence of VUR does not identify a susceptible population with an abnormal
kidney on DMSA. In the context of a normal ultrasound examination, cystography
contributes little to the management of children under the age of 1 year with a
UTI. In this context, a normal DMSA study reinforces the redundancy of
cystography.

Arsenic induced blood and brain oxidative stress and its response to some thiol
chelators in rats.

Chronic arsenic toxicity is a widespread problem, not only in India and
Bangladesh but also in various other regions of the world. Exposure to arsenic
may occur from natural or industrial sources. The treatment that is in use at
present employs administration of thiol chelators, such as meso
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropane 1-sulfonate
(DMPS), which facilitate its excretion from the body. However, these chelating
agents are compromised with number of limitations due to their lipophobic nature,
particularly for their use in cases of chronic poisoning. During chronic
exposure, arsenic gains access into the cell and it becomes mandatory for a drug 
to cross cell membrane to chelate intracellular arsenic. To address this problem,
analogs of DMSA having lipophilic character, were examined against chronic
arsenic poisoning in experimental animals. In the present study, therapeutic
efficacy of meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropane
1-sulfonate (DMPS), monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA) were compared in terms of reducing
arsenic burden, as well as recovery in the altered biochemical variables
particularly suggestive of oxidative stress. Adult male Wistar rats were given
100-ppm arsenic for 10 weeks followed by chelation therapy with the above
chelating agents at a dose of 50 mg/Kg (orally) once daily for 5 consecutive
days. Arsenic exposure resulted in marked elevation in reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in blood, inhibition of ALAD activity and depletion of GSH. These changes
were accompanied by significant decline in blood hemoglobin level. MiADMSA was
the most effective chelator in reducing ROS in red blood cells, and in restoring 
blood ALAD compared to two other chelators. Brain superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 
glutathione peroxidase (GPx) decreased, while ROS and TBARS increased
significantly following arsenic exposure. There was a significant increase in the
activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) with a corresponding decline in its
substrate i.e. glutathione. Among all the three chelators, MiADMSA showed maximum
reduction in the level of ROS in brain. Additionally, administration of MiADMSA
was most effective in counteracting arsenic induced inhibition in brain ALAD, SOD
and GPx activity. Based on these results and in particular higher metal
decorporation from blood and brain, we suggest MiADMSA to be a potential drug of 
choice for the treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning. However, further studies
are required for the choice of appropriate dose, duration of treatment and
possible effects on other major organs.

This study determined the role of the combined use of (99m)Tc-sestamibi and
(99m)Tc-pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid (V-DMSA) scintigraphy in evaluating
the effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma.METHODS: In
20 patients with multiple myeloma who had received or were receiving
chemotherapy, (99m)Tc-sestamibi and (99m)Tc-V-DMSA scanning was performed to
evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy.
RESULTS: In group A (11 patients with active disease), 42
(99m)Tc-sestamibi-positive lesions were found. Thirty-seven of those lesions were
also positive for (99m)Tc-V-DMSA uptake, as were 16 additional lesions
(nonactive) (NAL). Thus, in group A, the total number of positive lesions (TPL)
detected was 58 and the NAL/TPL ratio was 16:58. In group B (9 patients in
remission), 5 (99m)Tc-sestamibi-positive lesions were found. A further 22 lesions
were also positive for (99m)Tc-V-DMSA uptake. Thus, in group B, the NAL/TPL ratio
was 22:27. Therefore, the NAL/TPL ratios considered to represent effectively
treated lesions were 27.6% and 81.5% for groups A and B, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Combined use of the 2 agents allows the effectiveness of chemotherapy
to be evaluated through a comparison of NAL and TPL multiple myeloma lesions even
in the absence of a baseline study.

We report a girl with extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma complicated with impaired
renal function of the ipsilateral kidney, discussing aetiologies. A 14-year-old
girl presented with uncontrolled hypertension, high urinary vanillylmandelic acid
level and a 5 x 6 cm mass at the right renal hilum. Her blood pressure was under 
control with propranolol, prazosin, and nifedipine before surgery, and with
sodium nitroprusside during surgical intervention. The total tumour removal
required reconstruction of the right renal vein. Histopathology confirmed
pheochromocytoma. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) after surgery showed low uptake 
of isotope by the right kidney; it was unclear if this was due to the surgery or 
the tumour causing renal artery stenosis, but fortunately her blood pressure
returned to normal thereafter. We recommend obtaining a DMSA in the preoperative 
evaluation of pheochromocytoma.

Alpha-particle immunotherapy by targeted alpha-emitters or alpha-emitting isotope
generators is a novel form of extraordinarily potent cancer therapy. A major
impediment to the clinical use of targeted actinium-225 (225Ac) in vivo
generators may be the radiotoxicity of the systemically released daughter
radionuclides. The daughters, especially bismuth-213 (213Bi), tend to accumulate 
in the kidneys. We tested the efficacy of various pharmacologic agents and the
effect of tumor burden in altering the pharmacokinetics of the 225Ac daughters to
modify their renal uptake. Pharmacologic treatments in animals were started
before i.v. administration of the HuM195-225Ac generator. 225Ac, francium-221
(221Fr), and 213Bi biodistributions were calculated in each animal at different
time points after 225Ac generator injection. Oral metal chelation with
2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) or meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA) caused a significant reduction (P < 0.0001) in the renal 213Bi uptake;
however, DMPS was more effective than DMSA (P < 0.001). The results with DMPS
were also confirmed in a monkey model. The renal 213Bi and 221Fr activities were 
significantly reduced by furosemide and chlorothiazide treatment (P < 0.0001).
The effect on renal 213Bi activity was further enhanced by the combination of
DMPS with either chlorothiazide or furosemide (P < 0.0001). Competitive
antagonism by bismuth subnitrate moderately reduced the renal uptake of 213Bi.
The presence of a higher target-tumor burden significantly prevented the renal
213Bi accumulation (P = 0.003), which was further reduced by DMPS treatment (P < 
0.0001). Metal chelation, diuresis with furosemide or chlorothiazide, and
competitive metal blockade may be used as adjuvant therapies to modify the renal 
accumulation of 225Ac daughters.

BACKGROUND: Breast fibromatosis is a rare, benign, recurring, locally destructive
entity.
CASE: A 35-year-old woman underwent right-sided lumpectomy, revealing
fibromatosis with epithelial hyperplasia. Two years later, she was re-evaluated
due to a three times as large mass recurrence on X-ray mammography.
(99m)Tc-(V)DMSA scintimammography revealed diffuse increased radiotracer uptake
occupying the entire breast. A less widespread similar uptake was observed in the
contralateral breast. Mammography did identify neither the posterior margins of
the mass nor the left-sided lesion. The patient underwent mastectomy and
left-sided open biopsy, revealing bilateral fibromatosis. Ki-67 expression was
moderate.
CONCLUSIONS: (99m)Tc-(V)DMSA scintimammography can provide information regarding 
the nature of the lesion, its extent and bilateral involvement (especially in
dense breasts) and could prove useful as a predictor of its potential for
recurrence.

BACKGROUND: Acute pyelonephritis can induce parenchymal scarring. The aim of this
study was to evaluate the usefulness of procalcitonin (PCT) to predict renal
involvement in febrile children with urinary tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: In a prospective study serum PCT was measured and compared with others
commonly used inflammatory markers in children admitted to the emergency unit
with acute pyelonephritis. Renal parenchymal involvement was assessed by a (99
m)Tc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scar performed in the first 3
days after the admission.
RESULTS: Among 42 enrolled patients, 19 (45%) had acute renal involvement (Group 
A) ; 23 (55%) (Group B) had normal DMSA scan (n = 16), or old scarring (n = 4) or
various anomalies related to uropathy (n = 3). In group A, the mean PCT level was
significantly higher than in the group B (5.4 ng/ml, vs 0.4 ng /ml, p < 10(-5)). 
In these 2 groups, mean C reactive protein (CRP) levels were 99.1 mg/l and 44.6
mg/l respectively (p < 0.001). For a level of serum PCT > or = 0.5 ng/ml, the
sensitivity and specificity to predict the renal involvement were 100% and 87%
respectively; for a level> or= 20 mg/l CRP had a sensitivity of 94% but a
specificity of 30%.
CONCLUSION: Serum PCT levels were significantly increased in febrile children
with UTI when acute renal parenchymal involvement was present. PCT seems a better
marker than CRP for the prediction of patients at risk of renal lesions.

Misinterpretation of radioisotope imaging in pelvic kidneys.

We report the case of a gentleman referred with apparent worsening function in a 
hydronephrotic left-sided pelvic kidney. Imaging with
Tc-99m-Mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG 3) in 1999, showed that the left kidney
contributed 46% of renal function with no evidence of obstruction. Three years
later, repeat scanning showed ectopic kidney function had decreased to 20% and
with worsening pain, nephrectomy had been suggested. Review of the second MAG 3
scan revealed that only posterior images had been obtained. With pelvic kidneys, 
the pelvis forms a barrier between the radioactively labelled tracer and the
gamma camera, thus, reducing the amount of radiation detected and underestimating
function. A subsequent Dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA) was carried out with
posterior and anterior images, the latter showing split renal function was
identical to that seen on the initial scan. In patients with pelvic kidneys,
anterior views must be obtained during radionuclide scanning if unnecessary
nephrectomy is to be avoided.

    Acta Paediatr Taiwan. 2004 Nov-Dec;45(6):313-4.

OBJECTIVES OF STUDY: To gain new insights into the epidemiology, genitourinary
(GU) tract anomalies, etiologies, susceptibility of urinary pathogens to
antibiotics in children with urinary tract infection (UTI) during the past decade
in Taiwan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: By reviewing medical charts for patients admitted to
Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital between January 1995 and December 2003, we
identified and enrolled patients 14 years of age or less admitted due to UTI that
was confirmed by positive urine culture.
RESULTS: A total of 597 patients made up our sample. Sixty-eight percent of
patients were 1 year old or younger. Boys predominated infant cohort (68.1%).
Twenty-seven point one percent of the patients were found in urinalysis to have 5
white blood cells or fewer per high power field and 17.6% had positive nitrite
reaction. The pathogens were Escherichia coli, the most common (74.7%), followed 
by Proteus spp. (6.7%), and Klebsiella spp. (6.4%). E. coli was resistant to
ampicillin in 82.0% of the cases, followed by sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim
(55.2%), gentamicin (24.9%), and cefazolin (24%). Resistance to ampicillin and
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim tended to increase year by year. Forty point seven 
percent (164/408) of patients had GU tract anomalies, the most common being
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (87/164, 53.0%). Thirty-three point two percent of
the patients with acute pyelonephritis, confirmed by 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) renal scan, had VUR.
CONCLUSION: Our cohort was predominated by boys, especially in those less than a 
year old. E. coli, the most common pathogen, had a higher rate of resistance to
ampicillin and sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim. The pathogens that cause UTI were 
found to be becoming increasingly resistant to the common antimicrobial agents
used in this study. The most common GU tract anomaly was VUR, yet the incidence
was lower than that of other reports. A positive DMSA renal scan finding was a
good indicator for prediction the possibility of VUR in UTI patients.

Alteration of the organ uptake of the (99m)Tc-radiopharmaceuticals, (99m)Tc-DPD, 
(99m)Tc-DMSA, (99m)Tc-tin colloid and (99m)Tc-MAA, induced by the applied
cytotoxic drugs methotrexate sodium and cyclophosphamide.

Montenegro. drinaj@vin.bg.ac.yu

AIM: To investigate the influence of certain cytotoxic drugs on the organ uptake 
of the following (99m)Tc-radiopharmaceuticals:
(99m)Tc-2,3-dicarboxypropane-1,1-diphosphonic acid ((99m)Tc-DPD),
(99m)Tc-meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA), (99m)Tc-tin colloid and 
(99m)Tc-macroaggregated albumin ((99m)Tc-MAA). Methotrexate sodium and
cyclophosphamide were used as models to evaluate these effects.
METHODS: Two groups of healthy male Wistar rats were treated separately by oral
application of the drugs for 7 days. On the eighth day, each of the
(99m)Tc-radiopharmaceuticals was applied in a separate group of treated animals. 
They were sacrificed at different time intervals and the radioactivity in the
organs of interest was measured. The organ uptake of the
(99m)Tc-radiopharmaceuticals in an additional control group of animals was also
studied.
RESULTS: The results obtained showed an alteration in the organ uptake of
(99m)Tc-radiopharmaceuticals in animals treated with cytotoxic drugs. In rats
treated with methotrexate sodium, there was a higher uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA in
the bones, stomach and intestine, a higher uptake of (99m)Tc-DPD in the bones,
intestine, blood and muscle, a lower uptake of (99m)Tc-tin colloid in the liver
and a lower accumulation of (99m)Tc-MAA in the lungs. Cyclophosphamide-treated
animals showed enhanced uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA in the kidneys, a twofold enhanced
uptake of (99m)Tc-DPD in all organs except the stomach, a decreased uptake of
(99m)Tc-tin colloid in the lungs, spleen and kidneys and a significantly
decreased uptake of (99m)Tc-MAA in the lungs.
CONCLUSION: These results confirm that both methotrexate sodium and
cyclophosphamide may alter the organ uptake of (99m)Tc-radiopharmaceuticals in
experimental animals.

Electrolyte abnormalities at diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia may be a
clue for renal damage in long-term period.

Olgar S(1), Yetgin S, Cetin M, Aras T, Akhan O.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Hematology, Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine,
06100 Ankara, Turkey.

The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of electrolyte
perturbations and their relationship with leukemic status before and after
chemotherapy in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Blood biochemistry,
liver and renal function tests, and renal sonograms were examined at diagnosis
and during induction therapy in 334 patients. Renal and electrolyte disturbances 
were then studied in 116 patients between 3 and 110 months after cessation of the
St. Jude chemotherapy treatment protocol. Glomerular filtration rate,
electrolyte, protein, and beta-2-microglobulin levels were determined in fresh
urine samples, and serum electrolyte levels were examined in blood samples. Renal
sonographic examinations and scintigraphic examinations were performed with DMSA 
and MAG-3. Renal leukemic involvement was detected by sonographic examination in 
32 patients who had also presented with hyperphosphatemia or hyperuricemia.
Patients with electrolyte disorders at diagnosis were less likely to have tumor
lysis syndrome during induction chemotherapy. This may be explained by correction
of their electrolyte disorders at the time of diagnosis, which may protect them
from tumor lysis syndrome. Hypocalcemia and hyponatremia at the time of diagnosis
were found to be significant initial risk factors for renal scan abnormalities
and microproteinuria, respectively, during the late therapy period (P < 0.05).
Electrolyte abnormalities and renal changes were commonly observed before and
after therapy for leukemia. Patients presenting with hypocalcemia and
hyponatremia should be examined for microproteinuria and should undergo renal
scanning during the late therapy period.

Thermodynamics of the As(III)-thiol interaction: arsenite and monomethylarsenite 
complexes with glutathione, dihydrolipoic acid, and other thiol ligands.

(1)Department of Chemistry, 6128 Burke Laboratory, Dartmouth College, Hanover,
New Hampshire 03755.

Colorimetric (near-UV absorption spectroscopy) and calorimetric (isothermal
titration calorimetry) methods have been used to quantify the equilibrium and
thermodynamics of arsenite and monomethylarsenite (MMA) coordinating to
glutathione (GSH) and the dithiols dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), dihydrolipoic 
acid (DHLA), and dithiothreitol (DTT). We found that both arsenite and MMA form
moderately stable complexes (beta = 10(6)-10(7)) with GSH; that arsenite forms a 
particularly stable 2:3 complex (beta approximately 10(18)) with the biological
cofactor DHLA; that MMA has a somewhat higher affinity than arsenite for thiol
ligands; and that entropic factors modulate the overall stability of As(III)
complexes with thiols, which are favored by the exothermic formation of
As(III)-thiolate bonds. The implications of these results for arsenic toxicity
are discussed.

The radionuclide molecular imaging and therapy of neuroendocrine tumors.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) represent a large group of neoplasms deriving from
pluripotent stem cells or from differentiated neuroendocrine cells that are
characterized by the expression of different peptides and biogenic amines. These 
rare tumors tend to grow slowly and are notoriously difficult to localize, at
least in the early stages. Diagnostics involve blood, urine and biochemical
examination as well as imaging modalities. Imaging is achieved by a variety of
techniques such as radiological morphological imaging methods, for example,
sonography, computerized tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
angiography and finally, nuclear functional imaging methods such as
metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS),
vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor scintigraphy (VIPRS) and positron emission
tomography (PET) using (18)F labeled deoxyglucose (FDG) and fluorinated
dihydroxyphenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) as a radioisotopic marker. (131)I-labeled
MIBG is a well-established radiopharmaceutical for localization and therapy of
phechromocytoma and paraganglioma. The majority of neuroendocrine tumors possess 
a high density of somatostatin receptors. This observation provided the basis for
the development of various radiolabeled somatostatin peptide analogs as imaging
agents and therapeutics in nuclear medicine. FDG-PET is now performed in a wide
variety of tumors and indications, including diagnosis, staging, re-staging and
evaluation of the response to treatment. (18)F-DOPA-PET may be useful if
(18)F-FDG-PET scan result is negative. (99m)Tc-pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic
acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA-V) or (99m)Tc sestamibi ((99m)Tc-MIBI) or (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin 
is used only for diagnosis of certain NETs such as medullary thyroid cancer. The 
expiences with other nuclear medicinie imaging and therapy modalities such as
cholecystokinin (CCK)-B/gastrin-receptors, bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide
receptor scintigraphy are still limited, and further clinical studies are needed.
The studies using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for tumor
angiogenesis imaging, annexin-V for imaging apoptosis and agents for hypoxia
imaging are still in an early stage and the clinical role for these agents needs 
to be defined. In conclusion, no single imaging technique identifies all the
metastatic sites of NETs. The best results may be obtained with a combination of 
functional imaging such as PET or/and SRS and morphologic imaging with CT and/or 
MR imaging. Many molecular imaging and therapy modalities fur NETs are recently
under investigation or being developed, the usefulness of these modalities,
however, has to be evaluated by well-designed and multicentre studies.

BACKGROUND: Static renal scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA is a sensitive method for
evaluation of any reduction of cortical mass function. There is not enough
reliable references in the literature on scintigraphic reports in terms of
objectivity and standardization. The aim of this paper was to assess the
differences in interpretation of routine renal scintigraphic findings by nuclear 
medicine specialists from various institutions (interobserver variability).
METHODS: Both interobserver variability and agreement in the interpretation were 
evaluated in two groups. Six observers from four different institutions (group
A), and three observers from the same institution (group B) interpreted
independently 60 static renal scintigraphy findings obtained by analogous imaging
using x-ray films in four standard projections. Using at least two options, seven
parameters of renal scintigraphy protocols were analysed: size (1), uptake (2),
outlines (3), scars (4), focal changes (5), relative function (6), and
conclusions (7).
RESULTS: The interpretations of scintigraphic findings were in accordance in
items 1 to 7 within the group A: 62, 42.5, 45, 9, 47, 52, and 34 percent
respectively, and within the group B: 72, 55, 59, 22, 62, 60, and 41 percent,
respectively. The conformity was more significant in the findings observed in
group B as opposed to group A, which was statistically highly significant,
especially for the category of scars (p < 0.01). Significant variability was also
observed by six observers in all the parameters of scintigraphic protocol,
especially, again, in the scars analysis (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Insignificant degree of accordance, especially in the assessment of
scars necessitates the standardization of criteria and terminology in order to
interprete the renal scintigraphy with more accuracy and objectivity.

Comment in
    Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2005 Oct;32(10):1240-1.

PURPOSE: Although a number of prognostic indicators have been developed, it is
still difficult to predict the biological behaviour of all cancer types.(
99m)Tc-(V)-DMSA (V DMSA) uptake and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) expression and
activation level could be potential agents for this purpose. We hypothesised the 
existence of a correlation between V DMSA, whose uptake is linked to phosphate
ions, essential compounds for tumour growth and cell proliferation, and the
adhesion protein FAK, whose elevated expression and level of constitutive
activation are implicated in cancer progression. The aim of this study was to
assess the relationship between V DMSA incorporation rate and FAK expression and 
activation by phosphorylation on tyrosine 397 residue.
METHODS: We determined V DMSA uptake in six different cancer cell lines and we
measured FAK expression and activation by using Western Blotting analysis.
Correlations with factors known to be associated with poor prognosis, such as
invasive potential, resistance to chemotherapy and proliferation rate, were also 
investigated.
RESULTS: The cell lines exhibited different V DMSA incorporation rates. In
addition, these cells showed the same FAK expression, but various degrees of
activation. A correlation was observed between V DMSA uptake and level of FAK
phosphorylation and between V DMSA or constitutive FAK activation and
proliferation rate. However, no correlation was shown between these parameters
and the other factors tested, i.e. invasive potential and anticancer drug
resistance.
CONCLUSION: The results of this in vitro study clearly demonstrate that
phosphorylation of FAK, proliferation rate and V DMSA uptake are closely related.
Because proliferation and a high level of constitutive FAK activation are linked 
to cancer progression, it can be assumed that in vivo V DMSA uptake reflects
tumour aggressiveness.

Magnetic resonance voiding cystography in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux:
comparative study with voiding cystourethrography.

Lee SK(1), Chang Y, Park NH, Kim YH, Woo S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Dongsan Medical Center, Keimyung University College
of Medicine, Taegu, Korea.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of magnetic resonance voiding cystography
(MRVC) compared with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) for detecting and grading 
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRVC was performed upon 20 children referred for
investigation of reflux. Either coronal T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) or
gradient-echo (GE) (fast multiplanar spoiled gradient-echo (FMPSPGR) or turbo
fast low-angle-shot (FLASH)) images were obtained before and after transurethral 
administration of gadolinium solution, and immediately after voiding. The
findings of MRVC were compared with those of VCUG and technetium-99m ((99m)Tc)
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
performed within 6 months of MRVC.
RESULTS: VUR was detected in 23 ureterorenal units (16 VURs by both methods, 5
VURs by VCUG, and 2 VURs by MRVC). With VCUG as the standard of reference, the
sensitivity of MRVC was 76.2%; the specificity, 90.0%; the positive predictive
value, 88.9%; and the negative predictive value, 78.3%. There was concordance
between two methods regarding the grade of reflux in all 16 ureterorenal units
with VUR detected by both methods. Of 40 kidneys, MRVC detected findings of renal
damage or reflux nephropathy in 13 kidneys, and (99m)Tc DMSA renal SPECT detected
findings of reflux nephropathy in 17 kidneys.
CONCLUSION: Although MRVC is shown to have less sensitivity for VUR than VCUG,
MRVC may represent a method of choice offering a safer nonradiation test that can
additionally evaluate the kidneys for changes related to reflux nephropathy.

Post-pyelonephritic renal scars are not associated with vesicoureteral reflux in 
children.

Taskinen S(1), Rönnholm K.

Author information: 
(1)Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki University, Helsinki, Finland.
seppo.taskinen@hus.fi

PURPOSE: Children with pyelonephritis are at risk for renal damage. We assess the
value of clinical signs and urological abnormalities in predicting renal scars in
children following pyelonephritis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 64 hospitalized children (29 females and 35
males, median age 2.9 years) underwent ultrasonography and technetium labeled
dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy imaging within 1 week following the 
diagnosis of the first pyelonephritis. Voiding cystourethrography was performed 8
weeks after the diagnosis. Followup DMSA scintigraphy was performed in 58
patients after 2 years of followup.
RESULTS: Urological abnormalities observed were vesicoureteral reflux (VUR, grade
2 or higher) in 11 patients (19%), nonrefluxing and nonobstructed megaureter in 2
(4%) and pyeloureteral obstruction in 1 (2%). The first DMSA scintigraphy showed 
parenchymal defects in 48% of patients. VUR did not increase the risk of renal
defects. At 2 years after the infection 12 of the 58 patients (21%) had renal
scars. Nine of these patients did not have VUR. However, 2 patients with high
grade VUR and repeat infections demonstrated deterioration of kidney function
during followup. The patients with renal scars were older than those without
scars (3.1 vs 0.8 years, p = 0.0291) at the time of infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Renal scars after first pyelonephritis are in most cases not
associated with abnormalities of the urinary tract, but are caused by the
infection itself. However, structural abnormalities may predispose to recurrent
infections. Following pyelonephritis new renal scars may develop in all age
groups in both sexes.

Universitaire de Grenoble, France. kad1@libertysurf.fr

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the results of our
therapeutic management of blunt kidney trauma in patients hospitalised over the
last 10 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 1993 to January 2003, 105 patients were
hospitalised in our department for blunt kidney trauma. We retrospectively
studied age, gender, injured side, mechanism of trauma (direct, indirect or
deceleration), aetiology, presence of associated lesions (visceral, orthopaedic),
and clinical and laboratory signs on admission (haematuria, blood pressure,
haemoglobin and serum creatinine). The grade of the lesions was defined by
radiological assessment, specifying the presence or absence of devascularized
fragments and urine extravasation. All complications were noted and studied
according to the initial therapeutic management and grade. Follow-up was clinical
(BP and search for renal pain) and radiological (CT and/or DMSA scan).
RESULTS: 105 cases of blunt trauma of the kidney were hospitalised between
January 1993 and January 2003 in our department. The mean age of the patients was
28.7 years (range: 7-75 years). Trauma was classified into 5 grades on the basis 
of the radiological assessment according to the ASST (American Society of Surgery
of Trauma): 51 (49%) cases of grade 1 (n = 26) and grade 2 (n = 25) trauma, and
54 (51%) cases of major grade 3 to 5 trauma: 17 grade 3 (16%), 28 grade 4 (27%)
and 9 grade 5 (8%) were diagnosed. Among the cases of major trauma, 7 (13%) were 
operated urgently during the first 24 hours: 4 cases of grade 5 trauma with renal
artery dissection and 3 cases of grade 4 trauma with immediate uncontrolled
bleeding. The nephrectomy rate (partial and total), when major renal trauma
(grade 3, 4 and 5) (n = 47) was managed conservatively was 23% (11 nephrectomies)
with the loss of 9.5 renal units (20%); this rate was 57% for grade 4 trauma
presenting urine extravasation and devascularized fragments (n = 14). Twelve
patients (7 with grade 4 trauma and 5 with grade 3 trauma) were reviewed by DMSA 
scintigraphy with a mean follow-up of 63 months (range: 26-108 months).
Traumatized kidneys presented a mean function of 41.8% (range: 26.4-50%).
CONCLUSION: Blunt kidney trauma is usually managed conservatively. The
development of interventional radiology, endourological drainage techniques and
medical intensive care helps to maintain this attitude by decreasing the need for
surgery, even in the most severe trauma.

Comparative study between intravenous urography and renal scintigraphy with DMSA 
for the diagnosis of renal scars in children with vesicoureteral reflux.

Author information: 
(1)Section of Urology from Federal University of Bahia and São Rafael Hospital,
Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.

PURPOSE: To assess the value of intravenous urography (IVU) in detecting and
grading the renal scar, comparing its results with those of scintigraphy with
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 43 children investigated by DMSA and
IVU, who had vesicoureteral reflux diagnosed and classified through voiding
cystourethrography.
RESULTS: Among the kidneys with reflux, there was agreement between the results
of DMSA and IVU concerning the presence and the absence of scars in 82.4% of the 
cases. Based on the results obtained, IVU would have a sensitivity of 66.6%,
specificity of 94.4%; accuracy of 82.5%; positive predictive value (PPV) of 90%
and negative predictive value (NPV) of 79%, when compared with DMSA results. Our 
data also confirm the close relation between the reflux grade and the presence of
renal scar, since 75% of the kidneys with grade IV and V reflux presented scars. 
In relation to the grading of nephropathy, in 78% of patients the classification 
of the scar by both methods was identical. The highest disagreement was verified 
in the group with segmental scar on DMSA, where 41.6% of the kidneys were
classified as normal on IVU.
CONCLUSION: The data obtained confirm that the scintigraphy with DMSA is
essential in the investigation of patients with renal scar, and cannot be
replaced by IVU, due to its low sensitivity and lower ability of satisfactory
grading.

Genomic analysis of anaerobic respiration in the archaeon Halobacterium sp.
strain NRC-1: dimethyl sulfoxide and trimethylamine N-oxide as terminal electron 
acceptors.

Müller JA(1), DasSarma S.

Institute, 701 E. Pratt St., Suite 236, Baltimore, MD 21202, USA.

We have investigated anaerobic respiration of the archaeal model organism
Halobacterium sp. strain NRC-1 by using phenotypic and genetic analysis,
bioinformatics, and transcriptome analysis. NRC-1 was found to grow on either
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) as the sole terminal
electron acceptor, with a doubling time of 1 day. An operon, dmsREABCD, encoding 
a putative regulatory protein, DmsR, a molybdopterin oxidoreductase of the DMSO
reductase family (DmsEABC), and a molecular chaperone (DmsD) was identified by
bioinformatics and confirmed as a transcriptional unit by reverse transcriptase
PCR analysis. dmsR, dmsA, and dmsD in-frame deletion mutants were individually
constructed. Phenotypic analysis demonstrated that dmsR, dmsA, and dmsD are
required for anaerobic respiration on DMSO and TMAO. The requirement for dmsR,
whose predicted product contains a DNA-binding domain similar to that of the Bat 
family of activators (COG3413), indicated that it functions as an activator. A
cysteine-rich domain was found in the dmsR gene, which may be involved in oxygen 
sensing. Microarray analysis using a whole-genome 60-mer oligonucleotide array
showed that the dms operon is induced during anaerobic respiration. Comparison of
dmsR+ and DeltadmsR strains by use of microarrays showed that the induction of
the dmsEABCD operon is dependent on a functional dmsR gene, consistent with its
action as a transcriptional activator. Our results clearly establish the genes
required for anaerobic respiration using DMSO and TMAO in an archaeon for the
first time.

Strategies for safe and effective therapeutic measures for chronic arsenic and
lead poisoning.

Kalia K(1), Flora SJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biosciences, Sardar Patel University, India.

Exposure to toxic metals remains a widespread occupational and environmental
problem in world. There have been a number of reports in the recent past
suggesting an incidence of childhood lead poisoning and chronic arsenic poisoning
due to contaminated drinking water in many areas of West Bengal in India and
Bangladesh has become a national calamity. Low level metal exposure in humans is 
caused by air, food and water intake. Lead and arsenic generally interferes with 
a number of body functions such as the central nervous system (CNS), the
haematopoietic system, liver and kidneys. Over the past few decades there has
been growing awareness and concern that the toxic biochemical and functional
effects are occurring at a lower level of metal exposure than those that produce 
overt clinical and pathological signs and symptoms. Despite many years of
research, we are still far from an effective treatment of chronic plumbism and
arsenicosis. Medical treatment of acute and chronic lead and arsenic toxicity is 
furnished by chelating agents. Chelating agents are organic compounds capable of 
linking together metal ions to form complex ring-like structures called chelates.
They have been used clinically as antidotes for acute and chronic poisoning. 2,
3-dimercaprol (BAL) has long been the mainstay of chelation therapy for lead or
arsenic poisoning. Meso 2, 3, -dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been tried
successfully in animals as well as in a few cases of human lead and arsenic
poisoning. DMSA could be a safe and effective method for treating lead or arsenic
poisoning, but one of the major disadvantages of chelation with DMSA has been its
inability to remove lead from the intracellular sites because of its lipophobic
nature. Further, it does not provide protection in terms of clinical/ biochemical
recovery. A new trend in chelation therapy is to use combined treatment. This
includes the use of structurally different chelators or a combination of an
adjuvant and a chelator to provide better clinical/biochemical recovery in
addition to lead mobilization. The present review article attempts to provide
update information about the current strategies being adopted for a safe,
effective and specific treatment for two major toxic metals or metalloid.

Evaluation of the use of technetium Tc 99m diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid
and technetium Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid for scintigraphic imaging of the
kidneys in green iguanas (Iguana iguana).

Greer LL(1), Daniel GB, Shearn-Bochsler VI, Ramsay EC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Comparative Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University
of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of scintigraphy involving technetium Tc 99m
diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid ((99m)Tc-DTPA) or technetium Tc 99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) for the determination of kidney morphology
and function in green iguanas (Iguana iguana).
ANIMALS: 10 healthy iguanas weighing >1.6 kg.
PROCEDURE: Renal scintigraphy was performed by use of (99m)Tc-DTPA in 6 of the
iguanas and by use of (99m)Tc-DMSA in all 10 iguanas. After the injection of
(99m)Tc-DMSA, scans were performed for each iguana at intervals during a 20-hour 
period. Renal biopsies were performed in all 10 iguanas after the final
scintigraphic evaluation.
RESULTS: In iguanas, the use of (99m)Tc-DTPA for renal scintigraphy was
nondiagnostic because of serum protein binding and poor renal uptake of the
isotope; mean +/- SD (99m)Tc-DTPA bound to serum proteins was 48.9 +/- 9.9%.
Renal uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA produced distinct visualization of both kidneys.
Renal uptake and soft tissue clearance of (99m)Tc-DMSA increased over the 20-hour
imaging period; mean +/- SD renal uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA was 11.31 +/- 3.06% at
20 hours. In each of the 10 iguanas, ultrasonographic and histologic examinations
of biopsy specimens from both kidneys revealed no abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicate that the kidneys of iguanas 
can be evaluated scintigraphically by use of (99m)Tc-DMSA; this technique may be 
potentially useful for the diagnosis of renal failure in iguanas.

A large renal pelvic diverticulum, presenting incomplete excretion during tc-99m 
MAG-3 scintigraphy and tracer accumulation on tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy; a case
report.

This case report illustrates the dynamic and static renal scintigraphic images of
a patient with an unusual large diverticulum of the renal pelvis. The initial
diagnosis by intravenous pyelography (IVP) and ultrasonographic (US) examination 
was a renal pelvic diverticulum of the left kidney, and the patient was referred 
to the nuclear medicine department for exploration of the effect of the pelvic
diverticulum on renal functions. We performed dynamic renal scintigraphy with
technetium-99m (Tc-99m) labeled mercaptoacetyl triglycine (MAG-3) and static
renal scintigraphy with Tc-99m labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In dynamic
renal scintigraphy, bilaterally normal concentration function was observed. While
right kidney excretion function was normal, an incomplete excretion pattern was
seen on the left side. Complete urinary flow obstruction occurred approximately
at the 10th minute of the acquisition, which did not seem to respond to the i.v. 
furosemide application. However, when only the renal cortex was included in the
region of interest, the obstructive pattern disappeared. In static renal
scintigraphy, a large renal pelvic diverticulum localized antero-medially was
clearly visualized in the left-anterior oblique projection, most probably due to 
accumulation of radiopharmaceutical inside it. This case showed that a renal
pelvic diverticulum should be thought of when an incomplete excretion pattern is 
seen on dynamic renal scintigraphy. Using only a cortical region of interest may 
also help to distinguish other types of obstructive pattern from diverticulum.
Additionally, Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy may show diverticulum localization with
antero-oblique projections in addition to routine projections.

AIM: We retrospectively reviewed the results of ureteral reimplantation in
infants with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) to evaluate the effect on
prevention of urinary tract infection (UTI) and renal growth.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July 1991 to December 2001, a total of 205 infants
(180 boys and 25 girls) with primary VUR underwent ureteral reimplantation at the
Department of Urology, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal
and Child Health, Osaka, Japan. Indications for surgery were high-grade reflux
(grade IV-V), breakthrough UTI and non-compliance of medical treatment. Age at
surgery raged from 1 to 11 months (mean, 6.4 months). Ureteral reimplantation was
performed according to Cohen's method. Only two of 336 refluxing ureters required
ureteral tailoring. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 110 months (mean, 64 months).
Surgical outcome, frequency of UTI and individual renal growth measured by
(99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy was evaluated.
RESULTS: Postoperative ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography showed neither
residual reflux nor ureterovesical obstruction. Contralateral low grade reflux
occurred in six of 74 patients (8.1%) who had unilateral reflux preoperatively.
After reimplantation, 10 patients documented 13 febrile UTI. Eleven of the 13
episodes occurred early in the postoperative period (<6 months). Frequency of
febrile UTI reduced from 0.23538 before surgery to 0.00894 and 0.00081 per
patient per month at 6 and 12 months after surgery, respectively. No development 
of renal scarring was seen in postoperative DMSA scan. Changes of differential
renal function was <0.05 in all patients.
CONCLUSION: The present results show ureteral reimplantation in infants is safe
and very effective for the prevention of UTI. After surgical treatment in
infancy, individual renal growth of children with primary VUR is stable.

The conditions for which the geometric mean method revealed a more accurate
calculation of relative renal function in 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy.

Research Center, Adana, Turkey. fyapar@dr.com

AIMS: (1) To compare the results of calculating relative renal function (RRF) by 
using only posterior images (POST) with the geometric mean (GM) through both
anterior and posterior imaging on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.
(2) To determine whether there was an age-related difference between them and
whether some renal pathologies or asymmetrical renal function cause an error in
the RRF calculation by using posterior images only.
METHODS: Eight hundred and ninety-one DMSA scans were studied retrospectively.
The patients were divided into five age groups: group I, < or =2 years; group II,
>2 to < or =5 years; group III, >5 to < or =10 years; group IV, >10 to < or =18
years; and group V, >18 years. The RRF of the right kidney (RKF) was calculated
from the POST and GM counts. The differences between RKFGM and RKFPOST were
calculated in all the patients.
RESULTS: Among the 891 patients, nine had malrotated or malpositioned kidneys,
373 had renal pathologies of pyelonephritis, hydronephrosis, cortical scarring
and atrophy, 247 had asymmetrically functioning kidneys and 509 had normal
kidneys. When the patients were analysed according to different age groups,
significant differences were found between all groups (P<0.05) except groups I-II
and IV-V (P>0.05) with the F-test. The clinically meaningful RRF variance (> or
=5% difference between two methods) rate differed significantly between groups I,
II and III, and groups IV and V (chi-squared test, P<0.05). In patients aged < or
=10 years, a clinically meaningful RRF variance (> or =5%) rate was significantly
higher in the groups with pathological or asymmetrically low (< or =40% RRF)
functioning kidneys than in the groups without pathological or asymmetrically low
functioning kidneys, respectively (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: According to our findings, the calculation of RRF using the GM
method differs significantly from that using posterior images. Calculation of the
GM can effectively correct the RRF measurement not in only adults, but also in
the patient population musical #10 years of age. In addition, a significant
correction can be made in patients aged musical #10 years who have a renal
pathology or an asymmetrically low functioning kidney.

Contradictory supranormal function in hydronephrotic kidneys: fact or artifact on
pediatric MAG-3 renal scans?

OBJECTIVES: Contradictory supranormal renal function (SRF) in unilateral
hydronephrosis is a debatable subject resulting from the methodology of nuclear
renography or the characteristics of the patient. In this study, we aimed to
investigate the frequency and comparison of SRF with MAG-3 scans by 8 different
technical analyses in pediatric hydronephrosis.
METHODS: We reviewed Tc-99m MAG-3 scans in 82 children with unilateral
hydronephrosis (52 male, 30 female, mean age: 47.7 +/- 64.5 months). Of 82, 34
also had Tc-99m DMSA scans. Data were reprocessed with 4 different regions of
background activity (subrenal, perirenal C-type, perirenal ring, and lateral) at 
2 different time intervals (1-2 and 2-3 minute), and 8 different estimates of
MAG-3 differential renal function (DRF) were obtained in 67 patients. SRF was
defined as DRF greater than 55% in the hydronephrotic kidney.
RESULTS: The routine processing protocol showed only 3 renal units with SRF, and 
all were on the right side (3.6%). After reprocessing, a total of 10 dilated
kidneys had SRF in 1 or more of DRF estimates (5.2% of all estimations). These
cases were significantly younger (8.1 +/- 6.7 vs. 42.5 +/- 52.5, P < 0.05) and
had a larger renal area ratio (1.25 +/- .24 vs. 1.07 +/- .21, P < 0.05). There
was no SRF with DMSA. In comparison between MAG-3 and DMSA DRF in 20 children who
underwent both tests within 3 months, the best correlation was obtained when
C-type correction was used for both agents at 2 time intervals (r: .86 and .84
for early and late time intervals, P < 0.00001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: SRF in unilateral hydronephrosis is, at least, in part, technical in
origin in this particular pediatric patient population with tubular immaturity
(ie, physiological high background activity) and asymmetric kidney size.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to retrospectively define specific
features of the technetium-99m pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc-(V)DMSA) and technetium-99m 2-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-Sestamibi
[99mTc-MIBI]) distribution in ductal breast carcinoma in situ and lobular breast 
carcinoma in situ (DCIS/LCIS), in relation to mammographic, histological and
immunohistochemical parameters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and two patients with suspicious palpation or 
mammographic findings were submitted preoperatively to scintimammography (a total
of 72 patients with 99mTc-(V)DMSA and a total of 75 patients with
99mTc-Sestamibi, 45 patients receiving both radiotracers). Images were acquired
at 10 min and 60 min, and were evaluated for a pattern of diffuse radiotracer
accumulation. The tumor-to-background ratios were correlated (T-pair test) with
mammographic, histological and immunohistochemical characteristics.
RESULTS: Histology confirmed malignancy in 46/102 patients: 20/46 patients had
DCIS/LCIS, with or without coexistent invasive lesions, and 26/46 patients had
isolated invasive carcinomas. Diffuse 99mTc-(V)DMSA accumulation was noticed in
18/19 cases and 99mTc-Sestamibi in 6/13 DCIS/LCIS cases. Epithelial hyperplasia
demonstrated a similar accumulation pattern. The sensitivity, specificity,
accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for each tracer
were calculated. Solely for 99mTc-(V)DMSA, the tumor-to-background ratio was
significantly higher at 60 min than at 10 min and the diffuse uptake was
significantly associated with suspicious microcalcifications, with the cell
proliferation index > or = 40% and with c-erbB-2 > or = 10%.
CONCLUSION: 99mTc-(V)DMSA showed high sensitivity and 99mTc-Sestamibi showed high
specificity in detecting in situ breast carcinoma (99mTc-(V)DMSA especially in
cases with increased cell proliferation), and these radiotracers could provide
clinicians with preoperative information not always obtainable by mammography.

Establishment, Jhansi Road, Gwalior 474 002, India.

Administration of zinc either alone or in combination with monoisoamyl
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) during and post-arsenic exposure was investigated 
in male mice. The animals were administered 2mgkg(-1) arsenic as sodium arsenite,
intraperitoneally, once daily for 5 days either alone or in combination with
10mgkg(-1), zinc (as zinc acetate, orally), 50mgkg(-1) monoisoamyl
dimercaptosuccinic acid (MiADMSA) given orally (p.o.), 2h after arsenic
administration. Another group of arsenic treated animals was given both zinc
(10mgkg(-1)) and MiADMSA (50mgkg(-1), p.o.). Animals were sacrificed 24h after
the last dose. In another set of experimentation, arsenic pre-exposed mice
(2mgkg(-1), i.p. for 5 days) were treated with saline, zinc, MiADMSA or zinc plus
MiADMSA for next 3 days and sacrificed thereafter. Exposure to arsenic led to a
significant inhibition of blood δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD),
depletion of glutathione (GSH) level and marginal elevations of zinc
protoporphyrin (ZPP). Arsenic exposure caused a significant decrease in hepatic
and renal GSH level and an increase in liver oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and
liver and kidney thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels.
Concomitant administration of zinc with arsenic provided significant protection
to blood ALAD activity while, GSH and ZPP levels remained unaltered.
Co-administration of MiADMSA with arsenic significantly prevented accumulation of
arsenic in blood, liver and kidney while, zinc had no effect on tissue arsenic
concentration. Combined administration of zinc and MiADMSA had no major
additional beneficial effects over their individual effects. Interestingly,
post-arsenic exposure treatment with MiADMSA provided significant recovery in
blood ALAD activity while, zinc supplementation alone had no effect. The best
results however, were obtained when MiADMSA was administered along-with zinc.
Most of the biochemical variables indicative of hepatic oxidative stress
responded favorably to MiADMSA treatment while, zinc administration had no
effect. Administration of MiADMSA significantly depleted arsenic concentration
from the soft tissues while, combined zinc and MiADMSA had no additional
beneficial effect over the individual effect of MiADMSA. The results thus lead us
to conclude that in order to achieve best effects of chelation therapy,
co-administration of zinc with chelator might be preferred. However, detailed
experimental studies with variable doses and after chronic arsenic exposure are
required.

Enzymes involved in anaerobic respiration appear to play a role in Actinobacillus
pleuropneumoniae virulence.

Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the etiological agent of porcine
pleuropneumonia, is able to survive on respiratory epithelia, in tonsils, and in 
the anaerobic environment of encapsulated sequesters. It was previously
demonstrated that a deletion of the anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase gene
(dmsA) results in attenuation in acute disease (N. Baltes, S. Kyaw, I.
Hennig-Pauka, and G. F. Gerlach, Infect. Immun. 71:6784-6792, 2003). In the
present study, using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we identified an aspartate
ammonia-lyase (AspA) which is upregulated upon induction with bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF). This enzyme is involved in the production of fumarate, an
alternative electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions. The coding gene (aspA) 
was cloned and shown to be present in all A. pleuropneumoniae serotype reference 
strains. The transcriptional start point was identified downstream of a putative 
FNR binding motif, and BALF-dependent activation of aspA was confirmed by
construction of an isogenic A. pleuropneumoniae mutant carrying a chromosomal
aspA::luxAB transcriptional fusion. Two aspA deletion mutants, A.
pleuropneumoniae DeltaaspA and A. pleuropneumoniae DeltaaspADeltadmsA, were
constructed, both showing reduced growth under anaerobic conditions in vitro.
Pigs challenged with either of the two mutants in an aerosol infection model
showed a lower lung lesion score than that of the A. pleuropneumoniae wild-type
(wt) controls. Pigs challenged with A. pleuropneumoniae DeltaaspADeltadmsA had a 
significantly lower clinical score, and this mutant was rarely reisolated from
unaltered lung tissue; in contrast, A. pleuropneumoniae DeltaaspA and the A.
pleuropneumoniae wt were consistently reisolated in high numbers. These results
suggest that enzymes involved in anaerobic respiration are necessary for the
pathogen's ability to persist on respiratory tract epithelium and play an
important role in A. pleuropneumoniae pathogenesis.

Correlation of renal ultrasonographic findings with inflammatory volume from
dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans in children with acute pyelonephritis.

Wang YT(1), Chiu NT, Chen MJ, Huang JJ, Chou HH, Chiou YY.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Chi-Mei Foundation Hospital, Liouying, Taiwan.

PURPOSE: We correlated abnormal findings on renal ultrasonography (US) and
inflammatory volume (Volume) on technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid renal single
photon emission computerized tomography (DMSA) in children with acute
pyelonephritis (APN) with renal scars.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 31 males and 14 females (9 days to 9.8 years
old) who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for APN and who underwent initial DMSA
between January 1995 and July 2002 and followup DMSA at least 6 months later were
enrolled in the study. APN was diagnosed by initial DMSA, and placement in the
scar or scar-free group was determined by followup DMSA. Photopenic areas on
initial DMSA were calculated as Volume, and were compared to US findings.
RESULTS: Ultrasound demonstrated 35 abnormal kidneys (38.9%) among these children
with APN. Significant differences in age, Volume (11.19 +/- 2.52 ml vs 3.02 +/-
0.75 ml, p <0.005), C-reactive protein (CRP) and photopenic lesion on initial
DMSA were found between children with abnormal and normal US. Of 65 children with
initial APN foci 33 (50.8%) recovered, and the others had development of scars.
The sensitivity of US for detecting APN (identified by DMSA scan) was 49.2%, and 
the specificity was 88% (OR 7.1, 95% CI 2.18 to 24.41). The sensitivity of US for
predicting renal scarring was 59.4%, and the specificity was 60.6% (OR 2.3, 95%
CI 0.82 to 7.65). Patients with abnormal US findings and high serum CRP (greater 
than 70 mg/l) had a large Volume (10.96 +/- 3.05 ml) and a 76.2% chance of being 
in the scar group.
CONCLUSIONS: US findings are significantly correlated to Volume in APN. Along
with a high level of CRP, US is helpful in predicting development of renal
scarring.

Simultaneous administration of sodium selenite and mercuric chloride decreases
efficacy of DMSA and DMPS in mercury elimination in rats.

Health, P.O. Box 291, HR-10001 Zagreb, Croatia. djuresa@imi.hr

Two chelating agents meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and sodium
2,3-dimercapto-propane-1-sulphonate (DMPS) were tested for their efficiency in
mercury removal from the body of rats in the presence and in the absence of
selenium. Female Wistar rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of
mercuric chloride or an equimolar mixture of mercuric chloride and sodium
selenite (1.5 micromol/kg body weight). The chelating agents were given orally,
in excess (500 micromol DMSA/kg body weight; 300 micromol DMPS/kg body weight),
30 min after the administration of mercury and selenium. The animals were
euthanized 24 h after the treatment and mercury in the kidney, liver, and 24 h
urine was determined using cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS).
The simultaneous administration of mercuric chloride and sodium selenite led to a
redistribution of mercury in the organs, so that accumulation of mercury in the
kidneys was decreased and in the liver increased. Selenite also caused decrease
in the level of urinary mercury excretion. Both chelating agents were effective
in mercury removal from the body, by increasing its urinary excretion. However,
when animals were simultaneously treated with mercury and selenite, the rise of
mercury excreted in the urine due to the treatment with chelating agents was
lower when compared to animals receiving mercury without selenite. It is
concluded that sodium selenite decreases the efficiency of DMSA and DMPS in
mercury removal from the body of rats.

Lead is a ubiquitous element in the environment causing oxidative burst in the
exposed individuals leading to tissue damage. Antioxidants have long been known
to reduce the free radical-mediated oxidative stress while, thiol chelators have 
been used to treat arsenic toxicity. The therapeutic efficacy of melatonin or
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was studied in the present study, both individually and in
combination with a potent thiol-chelating agent, meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA), in reducing lead concentration in blood and other soft tissues. Their
ability to restore altered haematopoietic, hepatic and other biochemical
variables indicative of tissue oxidative stress in male rats was also
investigated. Administration of melatonin and NAC individually, provided
significant protection to lead induced disturbed antioxidant defense that may
significantly compromise normal cellular function. Administration of melatonin
and NAC also provided a significant protection to thiobarbituric acid reactive
substances (TBARS) levels, reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione
(GSSG) contents in tissues, suggesting their ability to act as a free radical
scavenger and in protecting cells against toxic insult. NAC, a thiol containing
antioxidant, has been used under several clinical conditions with few adverse
side effects. It has a high toxicity threshold and its wide therapeutic window
enhances its utility. The antioxidant action of NAC is due to its ability to
interact with reactive oxygen species (ROS) or its ability to stimulate
endogenous glutathione (GSH) synthesis. DMSA, on the other hand when given alone,
provided significant recovery in restoring the altered lead sensitive biochemical
indices like blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), urinary
delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), beside increasing urinary lead excretion and
decreasing lead concentration in blood and soft tissues. Interestingly, combined 
treatment of DMSA and NAC provided more pronounced efficacy in restoring altered 
biochemical variables and in reducing body lead burden than monotherapy with
DMSA. The results thus, suggest the involvement of ROS in lead toxicity and a
pronounced beneficial role of NAC in therapeutic implications of lead poisoning
when co-administered with a thiol chelator (DMSA) supporting the hypothesis that 
cellular redox status may be significantly reversed by utilizing a thiol
containing antioxidant compound. It can be concluded that, combined therapy with 
an antioxidant moiety and a thiol-chelating agent may be a better choice for
treating plumbism.

A case of a 27-year-old woman who ingested 9000 mg arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is
reported. Classical symptoms of an acute arsenicum (As) poisoning such as
gastrointestinal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, ECG changes and disturbed liver
function tests were observed. The absorption of the ingested As was minimalized
by a continuous gastric irrigation with highly concentrated NaHCO3 and intestinal
cleansing with NaHCO3 and polyethyleneglycol was performed. Forced diuresis, BAL 
(2,3-dimercaptopropanol) and DMSA (meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) were started
and therapy to enhance the formation of methylated As derivatives, which are
potentially less toxic and which can be excreted more easily, was then
administered. The patient survived this massive dose of ingested inorganic As
with only polyneuropathy one year later.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess relations between the clinical
course of UTI, IL-6 and IL-8 levels, and the presence of inflammatory changes
detected by renal scintigraphy using 99mTc-DMSA (DMSA).
MATERIAL/METHODS: We studied 33 children aged 1-24 months (mean 7.1+/-5.8 months)
with first-time UTI. The subjects were divided in two groups: with fever (group
I, n=10) and without fever (group II, n=23). Inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP,
leukocyte count), urinary IL-6 and IL-8 level, and DMSA scan were evaluated in
all children.
RESULTS: Urinary IL-6 and IL-8 levels [IL-6, IL-8/creatinine (pg/mg)] were
significantly higher in group I than in group II (Il-6 level: 39.4+/-41.1 vs.
6.3+/-13.7, p<0.01; IL-8 level: 791.1+/-1143.6 vs. 36+/-87.9, p<0.001). We found 
positive correlation between urinary IL-6 and IL-8 levels and ESR, CRP, and
leukocyte count (IL-6: r=0.43, p<0.05; r=0.46, p<0.05; and r=0.59, p<0.001,
respectively; IL-8: r=0.55, p<0.05; r=0.72, p<0.0001; and r=0.44, p<0.05,
respectively). We found no relation between urinary cytokine levels and the
presence of inflammatory changes detected by DMSA scanning, despite slightly
higher mean urinary cytokine levels in children with inflammatory changes in DMSA
scan.
CONCLUSIONS: We found significantly higher IL-6 and IL-8 levels in children with 
febrile UTI and elevated inflammatory markers. IL-6 and IL-8 levels do not
differentiate between acute pyelonephritis and UTI in children to age 24 months.

Paper chromatographic and paper elettrophoretic study of the solution chemistry
of Tc-99m-methylendiphosphonate and of Tc-99m-dimercaptosuccinate for improving
the tumour-affinity of Tc-99m during scintigraphic imaging of cancer.

In order to find the conditions under which Tc-99m-methylenediphosphonate
(Tc-99m-MDP) and Tc-99m(V)-dimercaptosuccinate (Tc-99m(V)-DMSA) may become
tumour-seeking agents, leaving healthy organs free from the radionuclide uptake, 
the solution chemistry of these radiopharmaceuticals was studied by paper
chromatography and paper electrophoresis in distilled water, in physiological
saline, in NAHCO3, and ascorbic acid solutions. Both radiopharmaceuticals are
anionic in the radiopharmaceutical solution but get easily hydrolysed to form
cationic Tc-99m species which concentrates in healthy bone and in some bone
metastases. Tc-99m (V)-DMSA being more stable remains long in the blood pool
giving undesirable presence of the radionuclide in lung, heart and kidneys, in
addition to its reduced uptake in bone metastases and in some primaries. We are
trying to eliminate these drawbacks of healthy organ uptake of Tc-99-m(V)-DMSA
not only to get a clean scintigraphic image of the tumour with this
radiopharmaceutical but to extend its formulation, thus obtained, to prepare
radiopharmaceutical with Re-188, which is the higher homologue of Tc-99m, for
systemic therapy of cancer. Essentially similar solution chemistry of both
radiopharmaceuticals suggests that like Tc-99m-MDP,
technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinate is also a complex of tetravalent Tc-99m and
not of pentavalent Tc-99m as so far supposed to be.

Can MRI replace DMSA in the detection of renal parenchymal defects in children
with urinary tract infections?

Dublin, Ireland.

BACKGROUND: Renal parenchymal defects may be a consequence of urinary tract
infections (UTI) in childhood. MRI is a non-radiation imaging modality compared
with DMSA scanning.
OBJECTIVE: To compare DMSA with MRI for the detection of renal parenchymal
defects in children presenting for radiological investigation after a first UTI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Both DMSA and MRI were performed at the same appointment
in 37 children (aged 4 months-13 years; mean 4.5 years) with a history of UTI.
Both planar and SPECT DMSA were performed. MRI of the kidneys employed axial and 
coronal T1-, T2- and fat-saturated T1-weighted (T1-W) sequences. Some children
had imaging after IV contrast medium.
RESULTS: The coronal fat-saturated T1-W sequence was the best sequence and it
detected all the findings on MRI. MRI had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity 
of 87% for the detection of a scarred kidney using DMSA as the gold standard. MRI
diagnosed pyelonephritis in two children that had been interpreted as scarring on
DMSA.
CONCLUSIONS: Renal MRI using a single, coronal, fat-saturated T1-W sequence is a 
rapid, accurate and minimally invasive technique for the detection of renal
scarring that does not employ ionizing radiation.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the applicability of 99mTc(V) -dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc (V) -DMSA) imaging in detecting neck metastases in patients with oral
squamous cell carcinoma.
METHODS: Single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) scintigraphy with
99mTc(V) -DMSA was performed on 32 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma 
in oral cavity. The coronal aspect of SPECT image was chosen, the region of
interest (ROI) of the affected neck was drawn, and the radioactivity uptake value
of the ROI was given by the computer to compare with the contralateral neck. The 
results of 99mTc(V) -DMSA were compared with postoperative pathological studies. 
For false positive lymph nodes, semi-continuous slice was carried out for
pathology examination.
RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 99mTc(V) -DMSA imaging for 
detecting metastatic lymph nodes were 75.0%, 90.0% and 84.4% respectively. The
ROI values of the affected neck are higher than that of the contralateral part in
the 9 positive patients (t = 8.128, P = 0.000 04). Metastasis was not found in
the enlarged lymph nodes of the false positive patients.
CONCLUSIONS: 99mTc(V) -DMSA SPECT imaging has fairly high affinity with
metastatic lymph nodes in the neck especially in the cN0 patients and is helpful 
for designing proper neck dissection.

Assessment of the optimal time interval and background region of interest in the 
measurement of differential renal function in Tc-99m-EC renography.

Center, Turkey. fyapar@dr.com

BACKGROUND: Differential renal function (DRF) measurements are routinely
corrected for background, which mainly affects the reproducibility and accuracy
of the measurement. The present study was conducted to identify the most
appropriate background ROI and optimal time interval in the calculation of DRF
for EC renography.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients were studied. For determination of DRF
in EC renography, the selected time intervals were 0.5-1.5; 0.5-2; 1-2; 1.5-2.5; 
2-3 min, and the background ROI types were inferolateral crescent, lateral
crescent, and perirenal shaped. The reference DRF was obtained through DMSA
study. For low functioning kidney of each patient, relative uptake differences
between the DMSA and EC scans were calculated. Then, the mean differences and the
standard deviations were found.
RESULTS: The highest correlation was between the DRF values obtained using
inferolateral background ROI in 0.5-2 minutes of EC scintigraphy and the DRF
values obtained through posterior DMSA images (r = 0.9889). However, there were
no statistically significant differences between the mean DRF values obtained for
each time interval with each ROI type (p > 0.05). For all the time intervals and 
background ROIs, the mean of the differences was <0.9%. In conclusion, in
obtaining comparable DRF values from EC and DMSA studies, none of the background 
types proved superior. Also our research for optimal time interval showed that EC
scintigraphy underestimates the DRF when compared to DRF obtained from DMSA
study. The DRF has a tendency to decrease as the later time intervals are used.
The time intervals less than 2.5 minutes show lower underestimation of DRF
values.

In order to evaluate potential long-term kidney damage of childhood leukemia and 
risk factors affecting renal damage, we studied 116 children treated for acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using the St. Jude Total XI and XIII protocols in
1991-1998. The median follow-up period after the completion of treatment was 35
months. The following parameters were examined: urinalysis, urinary creatinine
(Cr), calcium (Ca), phosphorus, beta2-microglobulin, glomerular filtration rate
(GFR), tubular phosphorus reabsorption (TPR), and renal function tests.
Radiological evaluation included renal ultrasonography (US), and renal scans with
DMSA or MAG-3 were performed. Blood chemistry and renal US patients were normal
in all patients except two. GFR, TPR, urinary Ca/Cr, beta2-microglobulin, and
renal scan were abnormal in 19.0%, 16.4%, 13.8%, 6.0%, and 40.5% of patients,
respectively. The abnormality rate in GFR was significantly higher in patients <2
years of age. TPR abnormality was found to be significantly higher in patients
who did not have G-CSF. An abnormal renal scan was associated with Hb < 10 g/dL, 
kidney infiltration, or hypertension at presentation and also occurred patients
who underwent methotrexate treatment with frequent intervals during the follow-up
period. Patients should be followed-up after cessation of therapy with the
conventional tests mentioned above. In case of any abnormality, further detailed 
tests should be performed; renal scan seems to be more predictive for renal
damage.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid for the treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia in hemodialysis
patients: a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial.

House AA(1), Eliasziw M, Urquhart BL, Freeman DJ, Spence JD.

BACKGROUND: Elevated total homocysteine (tHcy) levels may represent a potentially
modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients.
Current therapies, including multivitamins, have been ineffective at normalizing 
homocysteine levels in this population; hence, new therapies are needed. There is
increasing interest in the use of thiol pharmaceutical agents to displace
homocysteine from albumin and improve its dialyzability. We designed a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of
prolonged administration of oral dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on plasma tHcy
levels in vitamin-replete hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: Forty-four long-term stable dialysis patients were treated for a minimum
of 4 weeks with a standard multivitamin, ensuring a vitamin-replete state, then
matched on the basis of tHcy levels and randomly assigned as pairs to the
administration of DMSA, 2.5 mg/kg/d, or identical placebo for 8 weeks.
Multivitamins were continued for the duration of the trial.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight subjects (including 16 pairs) completed the trial. All
important determinants of homocysteine level were balanced, and the only
significant baseline difference was weight (P = 0.02). At 8 weeks, by paired
analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in tHcy levels
between the placebo and DMSA groups, at 21.2 micromol/L (2.87 mg/L) and 22.6
micromol/L (3.06 mg/L), respectively (mean difference, -1.4; 95% confidence
interval, -5.3 to 2.5; P = 0.45). The same was true for unpaired and
multivariable analyses.
CONCLUSION: This randomized placebo-controlled trial found that prolonged oral
administration of the thiol DMSA had no impact on tHcy levels in hemodialysis
patients. Additional strategies to test the homocysteine hypothesis in this
population require investigation.

BACKGROUND: Tc99m DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) scintigraphy has a high
sensitivity for the detection of cortical kidney damage.
AIM: To evaluate the Tc99m DMSA renal scintigraphy in children with a first
episode of acute pyelonephritis and its association with laboratory parameters,
kidney ultrasound and vesicoureteral reflux.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 143 children (age range 8 days, 12 years, 66%
female) hospitalized with the clinical diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (first
episode) with a positive urine culture and a renal scintigraphy performed within 
seven days of diagnosis. DMSA was considered the gold standard for the detection 
of cortical lesions. Its results were related to the presence of fever,
C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (VHS), white blood count
(WBC), ultrasound examination and vesicoureteral reflux.
RESULTS: Seventy nine percent of the population had an abnormal DMSA scan. There 
were no differences between sex, age and laboratory parameters in children with
normal or abnormal DMSA scans, except for CRP (p <0.005). Ultrasound was
coincident with the scan in 32% of patients. Eighteen percent had vesicoureteral 
reflux.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a high proportion of abnormal DMSA scans in children with a
first episode of acute pyelonephritis.

The role of diuretic renography in the evaluation of obstructed hydronephrosis
after pediatric pyeloplasty.

R.O.C. taminwang@yahoo.com.tw

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to clarify the value of renal drainage 
half-time in the evaluation of pediatric hydronephrosis after dismembered
pyeloplasty.
METHODS: We reviewed the records of 30 children who underwent dismembered
pyeloplasty for unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction with no other
associated urological abnormality. The follow-up duration was more than 5 years
for all patients. Pre- and postoperative evaluation included technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) renal scan, technetium-99m
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) diuretic renography, and
ultrasonographic examination. According to postoperative renal drainage half-time
on diuretic renography, patients were divided into 2 groups: group A with normal 
renal drainage and group B with prolonged renal drainage for evaluation of their 
renal functional status.
RESULTS: Postoperative diuretic renography revealed normal drainage (group A) in 
54% of patients and prolonged drainage (group B) in 46%. The anteroposterior
diameter (APD) of the renal pelvis of all patients showed improvement after
pyeloplasty. There was no significant difference in improvement of the renal
pelvic APD between the 2 groups. Furthermore, 92% of group A and 91% of group B
maintained stable or had improved differential renal function (DRF)
postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Drainage half-time is not a reliable parameter for diagnosing
obstructed hydronephrosis after pediatric pyeloplasty. We suggest that the renal 
pelvic APD and DRF should be considered when postoperative obstructed
hydronephrosis is diagnosed using the criterion of prolonged renal drainage
half-time on diuretic renography.

We present a case of phyllodes tumor of the breast in a 78-year-old woman
evaluated with Tc-99m (V)DMSA and Tc-99m MIBI scintimammography, acquired in
separate sessions (10 and 60 min post-injection). Tc-99m (V)DMSA was accumulated 
intensely within the mass [tumor to background ratio (T/B) >3], whereas Tc-99m
MIBI had significantly lower uptake (T/B 1.9). Histology revealed a phyllodes
tumor (maximum diameter 15 cm) and approximately three mitoses over 10 fields of 
view (FOV) x40, foci of epithelial hyperplasia and apocrine metaplasia. Stromal
Ki-67 expression was 7%. The tumor was considered to be benign and the patient
underwent mastectomy. One year later the patient presented with local malignant
recurrence of the disease with over 15 mitoses per 10 FOV. Tc-99m (V)DMSA seems
to have an advantage over Tc-99m MIBI in detecting mesenchymal tumors with
unforeseen biological behavior and Ki-67 over-expression, such as phyllodes
tumors, even with primary negative histological findings.

The effects of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and oligomeric procyanidins on
acute lead neurotoxicity in rat hippocampus.

Sciences, Institute of Biophysics, Academia Sinica, Beijing 100101 China.

Oxidative stress is considered to be a mechanism involved in lead neurotoxicity. 
Apoptosis is also thought to relate to lead neurotoxicity. The present study,
focused on the hippocampus, was designed to investigate the two possible
mechanisms involved in lead neurotoxicity and the potential protective effects of
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and oligomeric procyanidins (OPC). It was
proved that reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage were implicated in the
induction of apoptosis induced by lead in the hippocampus. Administration of DMSA
attenuated the oxidative stress and apoptosis in addition to having strong
chelating and lead-removing capacity. OPC alone had antioxidant protective
effects in the hippocampus but no removing capacity for lead in vivo despite
showing higher affinity and stronger chelating ability for Pb(2+) than DMSA in
vitro. It is suggested that OPC chelates Pb(2+) but does not discharge it from
the body and even accumulates Pb(2+) in some organs. At the same time, a
reasonable deduction can also be made that the complex of OPC-Pb(2+) prevents or 
at least weakens the neurotoxicity of Pb(2+). Whether this complex displays
toxicity over a long time span should be studied further.

Cadmium induced testicular damage and its response to administration of succimer 
and diphenyl diselenide in mice.

Federal de Santa Maria, 97105-900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.

Acute effects of cadmium in mice testes were evaluated. Animals received a single
dose of CdCl2 (2.5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and a number of
toxicological parameters in mice testes were examined such as
delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (delta-ALA-D) activity, lipid peroxidation,
hemoglobin content and components of the antioxidant defenses (superoxide
dismutase (SOD) activity and ascorbic acid concentration). Furthermore, a
possible protective effect of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and
diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)2 are studied. The results demonstrated inhibition of
delta-ALA-D and SOD activities, reduction in ascorbic acid, increase of lipid
peroxidation induced by cadmium, indicating testes damage. DMSA (400 micromol/Kg)
and (PhSe)2 (100 micromol/Kg) protected inhibitory effect of 2.5 mg/kg CdCl2 on
delta-ALA-D and restored the increase of TBARS levels. Otherwise, (PhSe)2
treatment was effective in reducing the increase of TBARS levels induced by 5
mg/kg CdCl2, whereas DMSA and (PhSe)2, in combination, were ineffective in
reducing TBARS level. However, these compounds alone or in combination, were
unable to protect SOD activity and to improve ascorbic acid levels near to the
normal value. The use of combined therapy (DMSA plus (PhSe)2) not proved be
better than the monotherapy, in improving toxicological parameters evaluated in
this model of testicular damage induced by cadmium.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether circumcision during antireflux surgery can reduce 
the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) after successful ureteric
reimplantation in patients with primary vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children who had undergone antireflux surgery for primary
VUR were divided into group 1 (27, circumcised at the time of antireflux surgery 
at the parents' request) and group 2 (50, those not circumcised). All antireflux 
operations were by the Cohen method. Regular urine samples were cultured to
detect UTI, which was defined as a single species with >10(5) colony-forming
units/mL in a midstream voided specimen. Numbers of UTI episodes before and after
surgery were compared between the groups, with (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) renal scans also taken in all patients. Each scan was blindly reviewed in 
terms of the size, number and zonal location of cortical defects, based on
morphology. Interval changes were categorised as improved, no change, progressed,
and new scar formation, and compared between the groups. Prophylactic antibiotics
were maintained until the follow-up studies at 4-6 months after surgery.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in age at the
time of operation (mean 42.4 vs 47.4 months), the age at the first documented UTI
(mean 26.5 vs 29.3 months), reflux grade, or number of UTI episodes and renal
parenchymal scarring on DMSA before surgery. There was no significant difference 
between the groups in the number of UTI episodes at a mean (range) follow-up of
151.3 (114-207) months after antireflux surgery. Also there was no significant
morphological change on follow-up renal scans and no difference between the
groups.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that circumcision during antireflux surgery
has no effect on the incidence of postoperative UTI.

Sitesi, Ankara, Turkey. atasever@gazi.edu.tr

AIM: To evaluate the clinical usefulness of early cortical phase images in the
diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and to compare the measurements of differential
renal function obtained by both 99mTc ethylene dicysteine (99mTc-EC) and 99mTc
dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA).
METHODS: Forty-three children who had undergone both 99mTc-EC and 99mTc-DMSA
studies within 5 days of acute infection were studied. Cortical images of
99mTc-EC were obtained by the sum of the renogram frames achieved between the
first 60-120 s of the renogram study. DMSA and EC images were visually
interpreted using four points of semiquantitative ratings: 0, normal; 1, mild
hypoactivity; 2, moderate hypoactivity with partial loss of margins; 3, marked
hypoactivity with loss of cortical margins. Values for the differential renal
function were obtained for both studies.
RESULTS: DMSA detected a total of 109 lesions in 36 patients and EC detected 90
lesions with a sensitivity of 82.5%. 99mTc-EC successfully detected
moderate-to-severe cortical lesions but was less effective with mild lesions
(sensitivity 60%). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated good agreement among the
results for differential renal function (95% CI -0.26 to 0.96).
CONCLUSION: 99mTc-EC early phase images detected most of the cortical lesions.
Its sensitivity depends on the severity of the lesions. EC provided reliable
information in the estimation of differential renal function.

Measurement of renal function by calculation of fractional uptake of
technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Nuclear Medicine, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade.
nuklearna@beotel.yu

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to set up normal values of the
fractional uptake (FU) of technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid in adults and in
the pediatric population, as well as to evaluate the validity of this parameter
at different levels of renal function.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 86 subjects was divided into seven groups. In
group A there were 23 potential kidney donors and in group B, 18 children in
remission after a first urinary tract infection. Another three groups consisted
of patients with diabetes i.e. group C, seven patients with normal values of
albuminuria, group D, 16 patients with microalbuminuria and group E, five
patients with macroalbuminuria. In group F, there were ten patients with a
well-functioning transplanted kidney and in group G, seven patients with
suspected acute rejection. The procedure began with the quantification of the
doses of 99mTc-DMSA to be injected and the measurement of the empty syringe lying
on the gamma camera collimator. Thereafter, four planar views of the kidneys were
acquired three hours after the injection. The counts from the posterior and
anterior views were subtracted for background and corrected for radioactive decay
time and patient thickness. The FU was calculated by the geometric mean of counts
per second from the posterior and anterior view. It was expressed as a fraction
of the injected dose.
RESULTS: The mean values of FU in healthy adults were 0.227 +/- 0.077 for one
kidney and 0.454 +/- 0.146 for both kidneys. The mean values of FU for the left
and right kidney were 0.225 +/- +/- 0.071 and 0.229 +/- 0.079, respectively. In
children, the mean values were 0.220 +/- 0.092 for one kidney and 0.432 +/- 0.094
for both kidneys. The highest values of FU of 0.322 +/- 0.078 (0.644 +/- 0.138
for both kidneys) were measured in group C. In group D, FU was 0.185 +/- 0.065
(0.361 +/- 0.125 for both kidneys) and in group E 0.082 +/- 0.040 (0.163 +/-
0.080 total). In patients with a transplanted kidney, fractional uptake was 0.162
+/- +/- 0.039 in group F and 0.065 +/- 0.021 in group G. There was no significant
difference in the values of FU between healthy adults and children. The uptake in
group C was 41% higher than in group A and the difference was statistically
significant. In groups D and E, the uptake was significantly lower than in A. In 
both groups of patients with transplanted kidneys, the uptake was significantly
lower than in control group. The correlation between FU and biochemical
parameters of renal function [blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr)
and creatinine clearance (CCr)] was significant: FU/BUN r = -0.86; FU/Cr r =
-0.77; FU/CCr r = 0.60.
CONCLUSION: Fractional uptake of 99mTc-DMSA could serve as a sensitive parameter 
of renal function. The mean values of FU in adults were 0.454 and in children
0.432. There was no significant difference between values for the left and right 
kidney. In diabetes mellitus, fractional uptake correlated well with the degree
of diabetic nephropathy. In patients with a well-functioning transplant, the
uptake was slightly reduced. Low values of fractional uptake in acute rejection
were related to lesions in kidney blood vessels and in tubular cells.

Australia. gsbite@ferntree.com

Arsenic is a traditional poison that has a history extending back into ancient
times, as a medicinal agent, a homicidal poison and more recently in deliberate
and unintentional self-poisoning. We report two cases of acute poisoning with an 
unwettable formulation of arsenic trioxide. Both patients had early
gastrointestinal toxicity and were treated with early whole bowel irrigation
(WBI). Chelation therapy with dimercaptosuccinic acid (dimercaptosuccinate, DMSA)
was commenced within 24 hours and serial blood and urine arsenic concentrations
were measured. Neither patient suffered any adverse outcome in spite of very high
blood and urine concentrations of arsenic. Arsenic quantification in blood, urine
and faeces suggested that enhanced gastrointestinal decontamination was minimally
effective for decontamination and that DMSA for at least two weeks was required.

PURPOSE: The management of high grade vesicoureteral reflux remains
controversial, with breakthrough infections being an indication for surgical
repair. We sought to determine if technetium dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scan
could help predict which children are at risk for breakthrough urinary tract
infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on children
presenting with a febrile urinary tract infection and prenatal hydronephrosis who
were found to have vesicoureteral reflux and underwent a DMSA scan. Reflux was
tabulated according to the highest grade. DMSA results were graded as 0-normal,
no parenchymal or size defects, grade 1-focal parenchymal defects or less than a 
quarter of a renal unit involved, or grade 2-severe defects to include at least
half of a renal unit, bilateral defects or unilateral atrophy.
RESULTS: A total of 120 consecutive patients were evaluated. An abnormal DMSA
scan was documented in 57 (33 females and 24 males), and 35 with grade 1 and 22
with grade 2 defects. Of the patients 53 females and 10 males had a normal scan. 
Of the 57 children with an abnormal DMSA scan 6% presented with grades 1 and 2
vesicoureteral reflux, 24% with grade 3, 38% with grade 4 and 26% with grade 5.
Of the children with grades 3 to 5 reflux 60% had a subsequent breakthrough
infection. Of the 63 children with a normal DMSA scan 11% presented with grade 1 
reflux, 28% with grade 2, 48% with grade 3, 11% with grade 4 and 2% with grade 5.
Of these children 5 had a subsequent breakthrough infection.
CONCLUSIONS: An abnormality on DMSA scan in the presence of grade 3 to 5 reflux
correlates with a greater chance of having a breakthrough infection (60%). We
conclude that children with grade 3 to 5 vesicoureteral reflux and an abnormal
DMSA scan are at increased risk for breakthrough urinary tract infection.

Dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy instead of voiding cystourethrography for
infants with urinary tract infection.

Author information: 
(1)Departments of Pediatrics, Göteborg University, The Queen Silvia Children's
Hospital, SE-416 85 Göteborg, Sweden. sverker.hansson@pediat.gu.se

PURPOSE: We study the ability of dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy to 
predict the presence of dilating vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in infants with
urinary tract infection (UTI) to simplify the evaluation protocol.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the records of 303 children
younger than 2 years with initial UTI investigated with DMSA scintigraphy and
voiding cystourethrography (VCU) within 3 months after UTI was performed.
RESULTS: In 156 of the 303 children (51%) DMSA scintigraphy showed renal lesions.
VUR was found in 80 patients (26%) and VUR grade significantly correlated with
the presence of renal lesions. A normal DMSA scintigraphy and dilating VUR (grade
III) occurred in 7 infants. At followup after 1 to 2 years, 6 of these 7 patients
had normal DMSA scans and 1 had a scarred duplex kidney. VUR resolved
spontaneously in 5 and improved spontaneously to grade 1 in 2 patients. None of
the 7 children had recurrent UTI.
CONCLUSIONS: DMSA scintigraphy in infants with UTI may replace VCU as a first
line investigation. A strategy to perform VCU in only patients with renal lesions
is proposed. In this study 147 of 303 VCUs would have been unnecessary as only 1 
child with a damaged kidney was missed.

Mercury binding to the chelation therapy agents DMSA and DMPS and the rational
design of custom chelators for mercury.

Clinical chelation therapy of mercury poisoning generally uses one or both of two
drugs--meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid
(DMPS), commercially sold as Chemet and Dimaval, respectively. We have used a
combination of mercury L(III)-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density
functional theory calculations to investigate the chemistry of interaction of
mercuric ions with each of these chelation therapy drugs. We show that neither
DMSA nor DMPS forms a true chelate complex with mercuric ions and that these
drugs should be considered suboptimal for their clinical task of binding mercuric
ions. We discuss the design criteria for a mercuric specific chelator molecule or
"custom chelator", which might form the basis for an improved clinical treatment.

Comment in
    Pediatr Nephrol. 2005 Aug;20(8):1201-2.

The incidence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in the general population is less
than 1%, but it is high in families with reflux. The reported prevalence of VUR
among siblings of index patients with reflux has ranged from 4.7% to 51%. Reflux 
carries an increased risk of pyelonephritis and long-term renal impairment. The
purpose of this study was to identify the age-related incidence and severity of
reflux, and the frequency of associated renal parenchymal damage in siblings of
children with reflux in order to assess the use of screening at different ages.
Between October 1994 and February 2003, 40 siblings of 34 index patients were
screened with direct voiding cystography. 99( m ) technetium
(Tc)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) nuclear renal scans were performed in
siblings with VUR to detect renal scarring. The cystograms were interpreted as
showing the presence or absence of VUR and the DMSA scan as symmetrical or
asymmetrical differential function, with or without renal scarring. Of 40
siblings, 17 had VUR, representing an incidence of 42.5%. The mean age at study
entry of the 15 boys and 25 girls was 63 months (range 6 months to 12 years). The
majority of siblings with abnormal DMSA scans were asymptomatic. Reflux was
unilateral in 12 siblings and bilateral in 5. Of the 17 refluxing siblings (22
refluxing ureters), 7 (41.17%) had a history of symptomatic urinary tract
infection (UTI). The frequency of VUR was nearly equal in siblings over 6 years
and those younger than 6 years. Of the 17 siblings with VUR, 16 had DMSA
scintigraphy. Of these, 5 were normal and 11 (68.75%) showed abnormalities (7
asymmetrical differential function and 4 parenchymal defect), which was bilateral
in 7 and unilateral in 4. In conclusion, this study confirms a significant
overall incidence of VUR and renal parenchymal damage in the siblings of patients
with known reflux. The prevalence of reflux in older siblings is similar to that 
in younger siblings. Our review suggests that all siblings over 6 years should
undergo a screening cystogram, even in the absence of urinary tract infection.
DMSA scintigraphy of asymptomatic siblings appears to be beneficial in preventing
renal injury.

Impact of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in 
patients with biochemical evidence of recurrent or residual medullary thyroid
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Conventional imaging such as with (99m)Tc(V)dimercaptosunnic acid
(DMSA), (111)In-octreotide scintigraphy, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) rarely localizes occult medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).
The role of (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)
is not well defined. The aim of this study was to examine the usefulness of
postoperative FDG-PET in localizing MTC metastases.
METHODS: FDG-PET was performed in 26 patients with elevated serum tumor markers
after total thyroidectomy with central compartment dissection and additional neck
dissection on indication. Patient- and lesion-based results were compared with
the findings of conventional nuclear imaging and validated by morphological
imaging (CT, MRI, ultrasonography), including bone scintigraphy and pathology
when possible. Clinical impact was evaluated.
RESULTS: FDG-PET detected foci in 50% of patients with lesion-based sensitivity
of 96%. (111)In-octreotide detected foci in 19% with sensitivity of 41%, and
(99m)Tc(V)DMSA scintigraphy and morphological imaging detected foci in 21% and
40%, respectively, with sensitivity of 57% and 87%. No lesions were found in 11
patients (42%). Positive FDG-PET findings led to surgical intervention in nine
patients (35%). They all underwent surgery for removal of residual tumor or
metastases. One patient achieved disease-free status. In all patients who
underwent surgery, serum calcitonin levels were reduced by an average of 58 +/-
31%.
CONCLUSIONS: For detection of occult MTC lesions, FDG-PET is superior to
conventional nuclear imaging and is the best detection method yet available.
FDG-PET in postoperative follow-up has clinical value and may be used for guiding
reoperation and additional morphological imaging preoperatively.

Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical/radiological features of patients with
primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) admitted to a single institution from 1969 to
1999.
METHODS: At admission, after the institution of chemoprophylaxis, patients were
investigated by CUM, DMSA, and US. The children were managed with periodical
clinical and laboratory evaluations. Analyses were performed with the data
obtained at admission.
RESULTS: A total of 483 patients were enrolled in the protocol. There was a
predominance of females (70%) and caucasian race (70%). Mean age at VUR diagnosis
was 26 months and 92.5% of the patients had urinary infection before admission. A
total of 710 refluxing units were analyzed. The distribution of reflux grade was:
grade I (49; 7%); II (254; 36%); III (190; 26%); IV (161; 23%) e V (56; 8%).
Approximately one half of the units analyzed were from patients presenting renal 
damage at admission. The distribution of the severity of renal damage was as
follows: mild (36%), moderate (34%), and severe (30%). There was a significant
risk of severe renal damage for the males (OR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.2 - 2.5, p =
0.002).
CONCLUSION: There was a predominance of VUR among females and most presented a
mild or moderate degree. However, there was a high percentage of renal damage at 
admission and a tendency to greater morbidity for the males.

Procalcitonin: a marker of severity of acute pyelonephritis among children.

S.M. della Misericovolio Udine 33100, Italy. paolo.pecile@uniud.it

OBJECTIVE: Febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common problem among
children. The diagnosis and management of acute pyelonephritis is a challenge,
particularly during infancy. The distinction between acute pyelonephritis and UTI
without renal involvement is very important, because renal infection may cause
parenchymal scarring and thus requires more aggressive investigation and
follow-up monitoring. However, this distinction is not easy among children,
because common clinical findings and laboratory parameters are nonspecific,
especially among young children. In an attempt to differentiate acute
pyelonephritis from febrile UTI without renal lesions in a group of 100 children,
we measured serum levels of procalcitonin (PCT), a new marker of infection. The
objective of the study was to determine the accuracy of PCT measurements,
compared with C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements, in diagnosing acute renal
involvement during febrile UTI and in predicting subsequent scars, as assessed
with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.
DESIGN: Serum CRP levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, leukocyte counts, and 
PCT levels were measured for 100 children, 1 month to 13 years of age, admitted
for suspected febrile UTI (first episode). Renal parenchymal involvement was
evaluated with DMSA scintigraphy within 5 days after admission. The DMSA study
was repeated 6 months later if the initial results were abnormal.
RESULTS: The mean PCT level was significantly higher in acute pyelonephritis than
in UTI without renal lesions (4.48 +/- 5.84 ng/mL vs 0.44 +/- 0.30 ng/mL). In
these 2 groups, the mean CRP levels were 106 +/- 68.8 mg/L and 36.4 +/- 26 mg/L, 
mean erythrocyte sedimentation rates were 79.1 +/- 33 mm/hour and 58.5 +/- 33
mm/hour, and leukocyte counts were 18 492 +/- 6839 cells/mm3 and 16 741 +/- 5302 
cells/mm3, respectively. For the prediction of acute pyelonephritis, the
sensitivity and specificity of PCT measurements were 83.3% and 93.6%,
respectively; CRP measurements had a sensitivity of 94.4% but a specificity of
only 31.9%. Positive and negative predictive values for prediction of renal
involvement with PCT measurements were 93.7% and 83% and those with CRP
measurements were 61.4% and 83.3%, respectively. When inflammatory markers were
correlated with the severity of the renal lesions, as assessed with DMSA
scintigraphy, a highly significant correlation with both PCT and CRP levels was
found. However, when the 2 parameters were correlated with renal scarring in
follow-up scans, a significant positive association was found only for PCT
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum PCT levels may be a sensitive and specific measure for early
diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and determination of the severity of renal
parenchymal involvement. Therefore, this measurement could be useful for the
treatment of children with febrile UTIs, allowing prediction of patients at risk 
of permanent parenchymal renal lesions.

Role of intravenous urogram in investigation of urinary tract infection: an
observational study.

(1)Renal Unit, Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital, UK.
Beena.Padmakumar@pat.nhs.uk

OBJECTIVES: To examine the value of an intravenous urogram (i.v.U) in patients
with abnormal differential (99m)Tc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake without 
scarring or ultrasound abnormality.
STUDY DESIGN: Forty patients (age 0-19 years) were identified over a two year
period in whom the differential renal uptake was >10%, who had smooth renal
outlines, and had no evidence of scarring. All patients had an ultrasound
examination. Two had marked urological abnormalities on ultrasound and eight had 
a duplex system in the kidney with greater DMSA uptake. In 18 patients where no
explanation was apparent for the discrepant DMSA uptake, an i.v.U was performed.
RESULTS: Eight patients had a normal i.v.U. In the remaining 10 patients, six had
duplex systems without scarring and four had appearances of scarring in the
kidney with reduced DMSA uptake.
CONCLUSIONS: In this small selected group an i.v.U will identify a significant
number of patients with normal kidneys, unrecognised simple duplex systems, or
scarring where the DMSA scan has been inconclusive. This will help in planning
long term follow up.

prod@columbianet.gr

Extrarenal uptake of Tc-99m DMSA is not seen very often. It has previously been
described in metastatic disease and was mainly attributed to the presence of
V-DMSA in the injected solution. We report a clinical case of incidental
visualization of metastatic bone disease of the colon in a patient with renal
failure. This could be the result of not only the presence of V-DMSA, but also
the renal failure and the atypia of the lesions.

In the absence of specific symptomatology in children, the early diagnosis of
acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a challenge, particularly during infancy. In an
attempt to differentiate APN from lower urinary tract infection (UTI), we
evaluated the ability of power Doppler ultrasonography (PDU) to predict renal
parenchymal involvement, as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m )Tc-DMSA)
scintigraphy. The study comprised 62 patients, 46 girls and 16 boys, aged 2 weeks
to 5 years, admitted to the pediatric department with febrile UTI. All children
were examined by PDU and DMSA scintigraphy within the first 3 days of admission. 
In the group of 31 patients with one or more DMSA scan abnormalities, the PDU
showed a matching perfusion defect in 27 (87%). Of 26 children with normal DMSA
scintigraphy, the PDU evaluation was also normal in 24. The sensitivity and
specificity of PDU for the detection of affected kidneys were 87% and 92.3%, and 
the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 93.1% and 85.7%,
respectively. These data indicate the PDU has a high sensitivity and specificity 
for differentiating APN from lower UTI and may be a useful and practical tool for
the diagnosis of APN in infants and children.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study is to analyze the clinic characteristics and
evolution of the primary reflux in infants.
METHODS: We studied retrospectively 203 infants in our hospital, diagnosed of
severe primary renal reflux. Renal ecography and cyclic mictional cystography
were practiced in all cases. DMSA was carried out in 181 patients.
RESULTS: Renal reflux was unilateral in the 23% of the patients, and bilateral in
the remaining cases; 72% of the renal reflux were grade IV and 28% grade V. The
renal injuries affected to male infants and reflux grade V. The renal injury was 
focal (27%), global (44%) and atrophic (29%). The 79% of the patients had
conservative treatment, while 21% had surgical treatment. 100% infants with
surgical treatment and 94.2% infants with conservative treatment were recovered
(Test of Kaplan-Meier). The 27% of patients developed one or several urinary
infections, but progression of old renal injuries or formation of new ones, were 
exceptional (3 cases): While the time the study lasted none of the patients
developed chronic renal failure nor arterial hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: 1) The fetal severe primary reflux of the patients was characterized
by the following features: to be bilateral reflux, to affect mainly to male
infants and to be associated in 33% of cases with a severe renal injury of
congenital origin (renal displasia) most of them unilateral. 2) The natural
evolution of the reflux goes to spontaneous recovery, so treatment must be
conservative. 3) Some patients underwent urinary infections, but progression or
formation of new renal injuries were inusual. None of the patients had terminal
renal failure nor hypertension and 4) Risk patients would be male infants with
bilateral injuries although these are infrequent.

AIM: To evaluate whether cortical scars can be detected using the summed images
of technetium-99m-L,L-ethylenedicysteine (99mTc-L,L-EC) renal dynamic scan, and
to compare the results with technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA)
scan. To evaluate the inter-observer variability for 99mTc-L,L-EC and 99mTc-DMSA 
scan reporting.
METHODS: One hundred and three patients were initially included in the study; 21 
were excluded, five due to a single functioning kidney and 16 due to impaired
renal function (serum creatinine>2.5 mg.dl(-1)). Eighty-two patients (39 females,
43 males), including 31 children, with a mean age of 33.4+/-11.3 years (range, 4 
months to 74 years), underwent both 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-L,L-EC scintigraphy
within a period of 14 days. 99mTc-L,L-EC images were regrouped into 2 min image
sets, and the initial 2 min summed image (cortical phase) was used for the
evaluation of scars. Three independent observers analysed both images separately 
on different days without being aware of the identity and clinical details of the
patients. Their 99mTc-L,L-EC findings were compared with the consensus 99mTc-DMSA
scan findings taken as reference.
RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of 99mTc-L,L-EC scans was 93% and the
specificity was 96%. The inter-observer variability was 0.91 for 99mTc-L,L-EC and
0.94 for 99mTc-DMSA scan reporting, using the weighted kappa analysis at P<0.05.
CONCLUSIONS: 99mTc-L,L-EC is an excellent single-modality comprehensive
investigational agent for renal morphology, function and outflow tract evaluation
with the added advantages of lower cost, convenience and low radiation exposure
to the patient.

PURPOSE: Pentavalent 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid [99mTc-(V)DMSA or (V)DMSA] is 
a marker of phosphate transport, entering cells specifically through type III
NaPi co-transporters. Phosphate ion is known to be involved in cell metabolism,
including the apoptotic cell death process. As phosphate accumulation decreases
during apoptosis, we investigated the influence of type III NaPi co-transporter
activity on (V)DMSA uptake during this type of cell death.
METHODS: Uptake of (V)DMSA and phosphate was compared in a leukaemic cell line
(U937) in vitro model after induction of apoptosis by a chemotherapeutic agent,
etoposide (VP16). (V)DMSA biodistribution in nude mice during apoptosis was also 
investigated in a U937 xenograft in vivo model. The percentage of apoptosis in
vitro and ex vivo was determined with annexin V fluorescein by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The in vitro results showed that, in parallel with the decrease in
phosphate uptake during apoptosis, (V)DMSA accumulation is negatively correlated 
with the percentage of apoptosis. Biodistribution studies showed decreased
accumulation of (V)DMSA in tumours after treatment with VP16. Animal studies also
confirmed an inverse correlation between percentage of apoptosis in tumours and
(V)DMSA uptake.
CONCLUSION: The activity of type III NaPi co-transporter is inhibited during the 
early stages of apoptosis, leading to differential incorporation of (V)DMSA in
viable cells and apoptotic cells both in vitro and in vivo.

Arsenic induced inhibition of delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase activity in rat
blood and its response to meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and monoisoamyl DMSA.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate arsenic induced changes
in blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) after in vitro and in vivo 
exposure to this element and its response to co-administration of meso
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA) either
individually or in combination.
METHODS: Rat whole blood was exposed to varying concentrations (0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 
mmol/L) of arsenic (III) or arsenic (V), to assess their effects on blood ALAD
activity. Varying concentrations of MiADMSA and DMSA (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mmol/L)
were also tried in combination to determine its ability to mask the effect of
arsenic induced (0.5 mmol/L) inhibition of blood ALAD in vitro. In vitro and in
vivo experiments were also conducted to determine the effects of DMSA and MiADMSA
either individually or in combination with arsenic, on blood ALAD activity and
blood arsenic concentration.
RESULTS: In vitro experiments showed significant inhibition of the enzyme
activity when 0.1-0.5 mmol/L of arsenic (III and V) was used. Treatment with
MiADMSA increased ALAD activity when blood was incubated at the concentration of 
0.1 mmol/L arsenic (III) and 0.1 mmol/L MiADMSA. No effect of 0.1 mmol/L MiADMSA 
on ALAD activity was noticed when the arsenic concentration was increased to 0.2 
and 0.5 mmol/L. Similarly, MiADMSA at a lower concentration (0.1 mmol/L) was
partially effective in the turnover of ALAD activity against 0.5 mmol/L arsenic
(III), but at two higher concentrations (0.5 and 1.0 mmol/L) a complete
restoration of ALAD activity was observed. DMSA at all the three concentrations
(0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mmol/L) was effective in restoring ALAD activity to the normal 
value.
CONCLUSIONS: The results thus suggest that arsenic has a distinct effect on ALAD 
activity. Another important toxicological finding of the present study, based on 
in vivo experiments further suggests that combined administration of DMSA and
MiADMSA could be more beneficial for reducing blood ALAD inhibition and blood
arsenic concentration than the individual treatment.

CJ, Gazolla LP, Fagundes TA.

Author information:

Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the outcome of prenatally
detected ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) managed with a more
conservative protocol.
METHODS: The records and imaging studies of 77 consecutive neonates with UPJO
identified by fetal hydronephrosis were reviewed. A nonoperative approach was
attempted in patients with mild/moderate pelvic dilatation, renal units with good
function as ascertained by DMSA scan and a non-obstructed pattern on DTPA.
Otherwise, the patients were managed surgically by pyeloplasty. Both groups were 
prospectively followed and the imaging studies were performed before and after
the initial approach and at one-year intervals thereafter.
RESULTS: Of the 77 infants (85 units), 39 were submitted to surgery (33
pyeloplasty and 7 nephrectomy) and 38 were conservatively managed. During
follow-up, 9 (24%) of 38 patients in the non-operative group presented renal
function deterioration and 3 presented with urinary infections and were submitted
to pyeloplasty. Of the 39 patients surgically managed, 76% presented improvement 
of hydronephrosis and 90% showed a non-obstructed pattern on diuretic renography.
The differential renal uptake, as measured by DMSA scan, remained stable in the
three groups analyzed (conservative, initial pyeloplasty, and delayed
pyeloplasty). There was a minimal improvement in those units submitted to
pyeloplasty with impaired renal function at baseline (< 40%). Mean renal uptake
was 28.6% at admission and 33.9% at the end of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: There was a wide spectrum of ureteropelvic junction stenosis.
Surgical intervention in a subgroup of patients with severe hydronephrosis and
impaired function may possibly improve or preserve renal parenchyma. Conversely, 
conservative management and clinical follow-up are safe and desirable for the
subgroup with mild/moderate pelvic dilatation and preserved renal function.

An early diagnosis of distant metastases or local recurrences of medullary
thyroid carcinoma (MTC) can be achieved by several conventional radiological
modalities (e.g., ultrasonography, computed tomography [CT], and magnetic
resonance imaging [MRI] as well as by radioisotopic procedures, such as positron 
emission tomography (PET), scintigraphy with different types of
radiopharmaceuticals, and radiolabeled receptor-ligands in particular. The aim of
this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC, a new
octreotide derivative, to detect recurrences of disease or distant metastases in 
MTC. Images obtained of 5 patients with high levels of serum calcitonin were
compared to findings obtained with other diagnostic procedures: 111In-octreotide,
99mTc-DMSA-V, 18F-flouro-D-deoxyglucose-PET, and CT/MRI. 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC was
positive in all patients and showed 15 areas of pathological uptake in the
cervical and mediastinal regions. 111In-octreotide was positive in 3 of 3
patients and showed 4 areas, compared to 8 of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC. 99mTc-V-DMSA 
was positive in 3 of 4 patients but showed 6 pathological areas, compared to 13
of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC. 18F-FDG-PET was positive in 5 of 5 patients but showed
only 11 areas, compared to 15 of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC. The CT scan was positive
in only 2 patients. In conclusion, 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC detected more sites of
pathological uptake than other modalities, showed better imaging properties than 
111In-octreotide, and might be the radiopharmaceutical of choice for providing a 
rationale for radioisotopic therapy.

Combined administration of taurine and meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in the
treatment of chronic lead intoxication in rats.

The present study describes the dose-dependent effect of taurine, an amino acid
and a known antioxidant, either alone or in combination with meso
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in the treatment of subchronic lead
intoxication in male rats. The effects of these treatments in influencing the
lead-induced alterations in haem synthesis, hepatic, renal or brain oxidative
stress and lead concentration from soft tissues were investigated. Exposure to
lead produced a significant inhibition of blood delta-aminolevulinic acid
dehydratase (ALAD) activity, reduction in glutathione (GSH) and an increase in
zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) suggesting an altered haem synthesis pathway. Only DMSA
was able to increase the activity of ALAD, while both taurine and DMSA were able 
to significantly increase GSH level towards normal. Animals treated with taurine 
significantly reduced the alterations in some of the biochemical parameters
indicative of oxidative stress. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS)
levels reduced significantly in liver, kidney and red blood cells, while GSH
level increased. Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) also showed an increase
in blood and brain in animals treated with taurine. The data also provided a
promising role of taurine during chelation of lead by potentiating the depletion 
of blood, liver and brain lead compared to DMSA alone. It can thus be concluded
from the study that concomitant administration of an antioxidant could play a
significant and important role in abating a number of toxic effects of lead when 
administered along with the thiol chelators.

BACKGROUND: Decreased relative 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) uptake 
can be a consequence of abnormal kidney size, associated with normal or impaired 
function. When there is a small kidney, relative 99mTc-DMSA uptake is decreased, 
and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish a small, normal kidney from a
hypofunctioning kidney. Here, relative renal function was studied by quantifying 
the relative 99mTc-DMSA uptake corrected for renal size (RCU).
METHODS: Five hundred and fifty-five consecutive patients (184 adults) aged 1
month to 82 years (mean, 14.8 years) underwent a 99mTc-DMSA study for various
renal diseases. Results were compared with the relative 99mTc-DMSA uptake without
size correction (RUU). Visual evaluation of images was also performed.
RESULTS: In 288 patients (52%) the relative 99mTc-DMSA uptake was normal, either 
uncorrected or corrected, for renal size; in 184 (33%) it was abnormal by both
quantification methods; and in 83 (15%) it was abnormal only by one method. Two
hundred and fifty-seven patients (46%) presented with decreased RUU in one
kidney, associated with a small kidney in 73 patients (13%). RCU was normal in
all of these 73 patients (100%, P<0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity of RCU
for evaluating renal function in relation to small renal size and with respect to
RUU were 72% and 97%, with positive and negative predictive values of 95% and
80%, and an accuracy of 85%. Visual analysis of the 73 studies with decreased RUU
and normal RCU showed a small, normal kidney on 55 occasions (75%), cortical
scars in eight (11%), and impaired bilateral function in 10 (14%). Visual
analysis of 10 studies with normal RUU and decreased RCU showed dilated
pyelocalyceal system in seven occasions (70%) and normal kidneys in three
(P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: It is concluded that relative 99mTc-DMSA uptake corrected for renal
size is a more accurate method for assessing individual renal function. When
there is a small kidney, relative 99mTc-DMSA uptake corrected for renal size can 
distinguish between a normal and a hypofunctioning kidney.

Effects of betaine in a murine model of mild cystathionine-beta-synthase
deficiency.

Health Center, Montrreal, Quebec, Canada.

Cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) is required for transsulfuration of
homocysteine, an amino acid implicated in vascular disease. We studied
homocysteine metabolism in mice with mild hyperhomocysteinemia due to a
heterozygous disruption of the Cbs gene. Mice were fed diets supplemented with
betaine or dimethylsulfonioacetate (DMSA); betaine and DMSA provide methyl groups
for an alternate pathway of homocysteine metabolism, remethylation by
betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT). On control diets, heterozygous
mice had 50% higher plasma homocysteine than did wild-type mice. Betaine and DMSA
had similar effects in both genotype groups: liver betaine increased
dramatically, while plasma homocysteine decreased by 40% to 50%. With increasing 
betaine supplementation, homocysteine decreased by 75%. Plasma homocysteine and
BHMT activity both showed a strong negative correlation with liver betaine.
Homocysteinemia in mice is sensitive to a disruption of Cbs and to methyl donor
intake. Because betaine leads to a greater flux through BHMT and lowers
homocysteine, betaine supplementation may be beneficial in mild
hyperhomocysteinemia.

BACKGROUND: Oral chelation tests have been used to try to define mercury toxicity
in individuals with dental amalgams, who are suffering from a variety of
non-specific symptoms.
METHODS: Self-reported healthy individuals volunteered to undergo an oral
chelation test using dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) at a dose of 30 mg/kg body
weight. Urinary mercury : creatinine ratios were measured pre-dose and 3 h
post-dose.
RESULTS: Urinary mercury : creatinine ratios were similar to levels previously
reported in individuals with symptoms that could have been attributed to mercury 
toxicity. One volunteer suffered a serious reaction to DMSA.
CONCLUSION: The oral chelation test using DMSA may lead to misleading diagnostic 
advice regarding potential mercury toxicity and can be associated with serious
side effects.

99Tc(m)(V)DMSA scintigraphy in skeletal metastases and superscans arising from
various malignancies: diagnosis, treatment monitoring and therapeutic
implications.

Skeletal metastases arising from a wide variety of malignancies including a few
cases with superscan appearance were evaluated using (99)Tc(m) MDP bone scanning 
and (99)Tc(m)(V)DMSA scintigraphy. Whole body planar scans were obtained at 3 h
and 24 h after injection of 740 MBq (99)Tc(m) MDP and 5 days later at similar
times after injection of 555 MBq of (99)Tc(m)(V)DMSA. A qualitative as well as
quantitative comparison was made between the (99)Tc(m) MDP bone scan and the
(99)Tc(m)(V)DMSA scan in detection of osseous metastases. The reference methods
used for discordant or equivocal lesions were correlative morphological imaging
modalities, for example additional conventional radiography, CT or MRI. The
present pictorial review deals with the results of qualitative analysis of the
study. A total of 75 cases have been evaluated. The vignettes illustrated in the 
present article demonstrate avid (99)Tc(m)(V)DMSA concentration in skeletal
metastases from a wide variety of malignancies and thus expand the potential
therapeutic indications for 188/186 Re(V)DMSA. The study also demonstrates the
valuable supporting role a (99)Tc(m)(V)DMSA scan can play in the confirmation as 
well as evaluation of the extent of malignant infiltration in a suspected
superscan in routine skeletal scintigraphy. In addition, a (99)Tc(m)(V)DMSA scan 
detected a number of metastatic lesions in and around joints and regions with
previous surgical intervention that were inconclusive in the bone scan. The
results in a few patients who were available for repeat scintigraphy following
treatment, support the convincing evidence that (99)Tc(m)(V)DMSA accumulation may
be a sensitive indicator of patient response to therapy. This might have an
important bearing in the context of increasing "cold" bisphosphonate usage in the
treatment of skeletal metastases, where skeletal scintigraphy with a
radiolabelled bisphosphonate derivative can often be fallacious because of
competitive inhibition by the non-labelled form.

Chronic arsenic poisoning in the rat: treatment with combined administration of
succimers and an antioxidant.

The influence of the coadministration of vitamin C or vitamin E on the efficacy
of two thiol chelators, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or monoisoamyl
DMSA, in counteracting chronic arsenic toxicity was investigated in rats. Vitamin
C and vitamin E were only mildly effective when given alone or in combination
with the above chelators in mobilizing arsenic from the target tissues. However, 
combined administration of vitamin C plus DMSA and vitamin E plus MiADMSA led to 
a more pronounced depletion of brain arsenic. The supplementation of vitamins was
significantly effective in restoring inhibition of blood delta-aminolevulinic
acid dehydratase (ALAD) oxidative stress in liver, kidneys, and brain as
reflected by reduced levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and
oxidized and reduced glutathione levels. The results thus lead us to suggest that
coadministration of vitamin E or vitamin C may be useful in the restoration of
altered biochemical variables (particularly the effects on heme biosynthesis and 
oxidative injury) although it has only a limited role in depleting arsenic
burden.

Brazil.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the clinical/radiological
features of patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) admitted to a
single institution from 1969 to 1999.
METHODS: The patients' records were retrospectively reviewed and the following
clinical data obtained at admission were analyzed: age, gender, race, date of
entry, previous symptoms, weight, height, blood pressure, and serum renal
function. The renal imaging tests at baseline were also retrospectively analyzed 
including voiding cystourethrography, excretory urography, DMSA scan, and
ultrasonography. For statistical analysis, reflux was classified into two
categories: (1) mild/moderate (grade I/II/III) and (2) severe (grade IV/IV).
Renal damage was categorized according to the following classification: (I) mild,
focal damage; (II) moderate, more extensive scars, and (III) severe, generalized 
damage or shrunken kidney. The odds ratio (OR) and the respective confidence
interval (95%CI) were calculated to compare the difference in risk between
groups.
RESULTS: A total of 461 patients were enrolled in the protocol. There was a
predominance of female gender (71%) and white race (73%). Mean age at VUR
diagnosis was 2.8 y and 93% of the patients had urinary infection before
admission. Bilateral reflux was diagnosed in 249 (54%) children, for a total of
710 renal units for study. The distribution of reflux grade was as follows: grade
I (7%); II (36%); III (26%); IV (23%), and V (8%). Of the 450 children
investigated, 180 (40%) presented with renal damage, for a total of 234 (26%)
units with renal scars. Renal damage was associated with the following factors:
Diagnosis after 2 y of age (OR = 1.5, 95%CI = 1.08-2.1, p = 0.01), severe degree 
of reflux (OR = 6, 95%CI = 4-9, p < 0.001). There was a significant risk of
severe renal damage for male gender (OR = 1.9, IC95% = 1.3-2.1, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: There was a predominance of renal damage in children diagnosed above 
2 y and with a high degree of reflux. Severe renal damage was associated with
male gender.

The effect of combined treatment with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and
calcium supplementation in reducing lead absorption and enhancing lead
elimination was evaluated in suckling rats under two experimental conditions:
during ongoing oral lead exposure (lead acetate, 2 mg Pb kg(-1) day(-1), total
dose 16 mg Pb kg(-1)) or after lead exposure (72 h after a 2-day lead exposure,
total dose 12 mg Pb kg(-1) s.c.). The artificial feeding method was used for
calcium supplementation, with 6% Ca (as CaHPO(4)) suspension in cow's milk to
increase the daily calcium intake about three times above control values.
Artificial feeding lasted for 7 h a day over eight consecutive days. During this 
period DMSA was administered on 6 days twice a day (0.5 mmol kg(-1) day(-1)
p.o.). At the end of the experiments, Pb, Ca and Zn in the carcass and Pb, Fe and
Cu in the liver, kidneys and brain were analysed by atomic absorption
spectrometry. Calcium supplementation during lead exposure reduced tissue lead
but had no effect when applied after lead exposure, and DMSA administered either 
during or after lead exposure lowered the tissue lead. Combined treatment during 
ongoing lead exposure caused a greater reduction in tissue lead than either DMSA 
or calcium treatment alone. When administered after lead exposure, it had no
advantage over DMSA treatment alone but did not impair its efficacy. Combined
treatment had no influence on growth and did not seriously disturb essential
element status. It is concluded that calcium supplementation could be applied
during DMSA therapy, when indicated.

Combined early treatment with chelating agents DMSA and CaDTPA in acute oral
cadmium exposure.

Sarić MM(1), Blanusa M, Juresa D, Sarić M, Varnai VM, Kostial K.

Health, Zagreb, Croatia.

The influence of chelating agents: meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA);
calcium trisodium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (CaDTPA) and their combination
on mobilisation of cadmium (Cd) was compared in female albino rats. After oral Cd
administration chelators were applied either orally (DMSA) or intraperitoneally
(CaDTPA) at various short time intervals after Cd. Three experiments were carried
out with four treatment groups in each: 1) Cd (control); 2) Cd+DMSA; 3)
Cd+CaDTPA; 4) Cd+DMSA+CaDTPA. Time intervals for chelator treatment after Cd
administration were: immediate application in the first, half an hour in the
second and one hour in the third experiment. At the end of each experiment
cadmium was analysed in kidney and liver. Additionally in experiment 3 essential 
elements (Fe, Cu, Zn) were also determined in the same organs. In experiment 2
the effect of the treatment on urinary elimination of cadmium, copper and zinc
were analysed. Results showed that the efficiency of Cd removal from the body
(kidneys and liver) is lower when the time between Cd and chelating agents
administration is longer. The two chelators differ in efficiency in mobilizing
Cd, with DMSA being more efficient than CaDTPA. The combined therapy with the two
chelators gave generally better results. It seems that DMSA which is given orally
after oral Cd administration removes this element very efficiently from the
gastrointestinal tract. CaDTPA, however, which is given parenterally removes
absorbed Cd less efficiently, Organs are not significantly depleted in iron and
copper after chelation treatment. Only zinc concentration was, however,
significantly lower in the liver and higher in kidneys only after CaDTPA and
combined DMSA+CaDTPA chelation.

La Cava G.

Italy.

BACKGROUND: Reflux nephropathy (RN) is a pathophysiological human model of
reduced nephron reserve, due to loss of renal mass, but little information exists
about the role of urinary endothelin-1 (uET-1) in this disease. The aim of this
study was to assess the presence of uET-1-like-immunoreactivity (uET-1L) in RN
patients, particularly if lateralized renal damage existed.
METHODS: Thirty patients with vescico-ureteral reflux (VUR) and consequent RN,
were studied. The presence of VUR was established by voiding cysto-urethrography.
RN was assessed and graded by 99mTc-dimercapto-succinic acid scan (DMSA). Renal
plasma flow (ERPF) was evaluated by (123)I-Hippuran renal sequential
scintigraphy, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by creatinine clearance.
Forty-five healthy subjects were selected as a control group. uET-1L excretion,
in both affected and control groups, was assayed.
RESULTS: Mann-Whitney U test showed a significant difference between control and 
patient groups in both GFR and uET-1L. A good correlation between DMSA grading,
single kidney clearance and VUR grade was shown. A significant relationship was
also shown between uET-1L and both ERPF and GFR. Patients with RN were divided
into two subgroups according to functional damage lateralization. Between the two
groups, a significant difference was found only for uET-1L when GFR was applied
as a covariate in ANCOVA analysis.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results confirmed the increase of urinary ET-1L
excretion in RN, especially when renal functional injury was lateralized.

kidneys and renal buds?

Hospital Graz, Graz, Austria. marcus.riccabona@bhs.at

PURPOSE: We evaluated the diagnostic potential of magnetic resonance urography
(MRU) in pediatric patients with a solitary kidney and/or dysplastic orthotopic
or ectopic renal buds. We present our evolving experience with this imaging
procedure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 patients with a mean age of 43.8 months with
a known or suspected solitary kidney with or without clinical symptoms underwent 
ultrasound of the urinary tract as well as voiding cystourethrogram, renal static
dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy and MRU. The results of these
diagnostic imaging studies were then compared with each other and set against the
results of the final diagnosis established at surgery and by histology, if
available.
RESULTS: Dysplastic orthotopic or dystopic renal buds suspected on ultrasound in 
11 of the 30 patients were confirmed in all 11 by MRU. While accompanying ectopic
ureteral insertions were shown in only 3 patients by ultrasound, they were
visualized in all 4 by MRU. The other 7 patients with dysplastic renal buds had
orthotopic ureteral orifices. DMSA scintigraphy failed to detect 10 renal buds.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic value of MRU appears to be superior to that of other 
imaging tests, even to that of DMSA scintigraphy, which with voiding
cystourethrography is currently considered the gold standard for evaluating
sonographically suspected solitary kidneys with contralateral orthotopic or
ectopic renal buds and ectopic ureteral insertion.

The effects of dithiol chelating agents meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 
2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS), and 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BAL) on
delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (delta-ALA-D) from human erythrocytes were
evaluated. Furthermore, possible protective effects of zinc chloride (ZnCl(2)),
dithiothreitol (DTT), and cysteine were studied. delta-ALA-D activity from human 
erythrocytes was inhibited by dithiol chelating agents in a
concentration-dependent manner. Cysteine, at all concentrations tested, did not
protect the inhibitory effect of 1 and 4 mM DMPS and DMSA, but protected 1 mM BAL
inhibition. Dithiotreitol was able to protect the inhibition caused by 1 mM BAL
(28%), DMPS (56%), and DMSA (40%) in a concentration-dependent manner. Zinc
chloride protected and restored 1 mM BAL inhibitory effect on delta-ALA-D. Zinc
chloride at 500 microM and 1 mM, respectively, protected inhibitory effects of
DMPS and DMSA (1 and 4 mM), but did not reverse its effects. The preincubation of
dithiol chelating agents with enzyme demonstrated that DMSA was the most potent
delta-ALA-D inhibitor of human erythrocytes. These data are in agreement with
delta-ALA-D activity from purified enzyme. ZnCl(2) (1 microM) added, in the
reaction mixture, increased enzyme activity and DTT (100 microM) totally restored
the enzyme activity for all chelating agents tested.

OBJECTIVE: To detect the different extent of renal parenchymal involvement in
primary vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR), and to evaluate the relationship between
VUR grade, patient age and different patterns of parenchymal damage.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This blinded retrospective study included 197 consecutive
children (mean age 4.26 years, range 1 month to 13 years) with primary VUR
detected by voiding cysto-urethrography (VCUG), 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA; 120 MBq/1.73 m2) renal scintigraphy, with scanning for 3 h after
intravenous injection. An abnormal DMSA scan was classified into three subtypes: 
cortical defects as a single scar (SS), multiple cortical scarring (MS) and
diffuse reduced uptake with small renal size. Renal absolute uptake (AU), and
split-kidney relative uptake were evaluated in refluxing and nonrefluxing renal
units, and correlated with parenchymal damage and patient age. Student's t-test
and the chi-square test were used for the statistical analysis.
RESULTS: In all, 282 refluxing and 112 nonrefluxing units were assessed. Renal
damage was detected in 188 of 282 units with VUR (67%) and in 18 of 112 (16%)
contralateral nonrefluxing kidneys. The mean AU was 18.7% in kidneys with VUR and
29% in nonrefluxing units (P < 0.001). The mean (SD) AU decreased from lower to
higher grades of VUR, i.e. grade 0 VUR (group A), 28.97 (9.71); grade 1-3 (group 
B), 21.28 (8.33); grade 4-5 (group C), 14.78 (8.02). The differences were
statistically significant (A vs B, B vs C, both P < 0.001). Renal damage was
differently distributed in the three groups: 69 of 109 kidneys (63%) in group C
(MS prevalent), 39 of 173 (22.5%) in group B (SS prevalent) and 17 of 112 (15.2%)
in group A. There was no significant difference in the distribution of renal
damage subtypes in patients aged < or > 2 years (SS 19.6% vs 17.9%, MS 29.6% vs
30.1%, small size 48.2% vs 46.3%). The VUR was severe (group C) in 65% of
patients aged < 2 years and in 46% aged > 2 years (chi-square, P = 0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: VUR is commonly associated with renal damage. Age (< or > 2 years)
did not significantly influence the kidney lesion subtype. Reduced parenchymal
function (AU) progressively decreased with the severity of VUR. Focal MS, reduced
size and relative uptake were significantly more common in severe VUR, leading to
multifocal lesions and hypo-dysplasia. Renal scarring was present in up to 15% of
contralateral nonrefluxing kidneys. Severe VUR behaved differently from lesser
VUR in the renal scan parenchymal uptake.

mrdesai@mpuh.org

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pediatric renal calculus disease has been a management
dilemma in view of the concern about the effects of the various treatment
modalities on the growing kidney, the significant recurrence rate, and the
long-term outcome. We report our experience with percutaneous nephrolithotomy
(PCNL) monotherapy in staghorn or complex pediatric renal calculi.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the case records of 116
patients younger than 15 years who underwent PCNL. The stones included 56 complex
calculi. We defined complex calculi as either staghorn (complete or partial) or
those with a large bulk and involving more than one calix, the upper ureter, or
both.
RESULTS: Complete clearance was achieved in 50 patients (89.8%). Of these, 22
(39%) required a single tract, while 34 (61%) required multiple tracts. With
subsequent SWL, the clearance rate increased to 96%. The average hemoglobin drop 
was 1.9 g/dL. Assessing the factors affecting the hemoglobin drop, the number of 
tracts and the size of tracts were found to be significant (P<0.01). The average 
change in the serum creatinine concentration between the preoperative and
postoperative measurements was +0.03 mg/dL and was not different in patients with
a single tract and those with multiple tracts (+0.02 and +0.04 mg/dL,
respectively; P=NS). Intravenous urography done in 36 renal units postoperatively
revealed good function in all. A DMSA renal scan in six children showed no scar.
CONCLUSIONS: Monotherapy with PCNL is safe and effective in the management of
staghorn and complex renal calculi in single hospital stay. Ultrasound-guided
peripheral caliceal puncture and limiting the tract dilatation to 22F are
important factors in reducing the blood loss. Multiple tracts increase the
hemoglobin drop but are not associated with an increased risk of complications
(bleeding, postoperative infection, and prolonged urinary leak). Also, there is
no deterioration in renal function after either single- or multiple-tract PCNL.

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate renal size in children with normal
99mTc-DMSA scans and to compare it with the published ultrasonographic values.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Renal length of DMSA normal scans obtained from 253
children with history of urinary tract infection was measured. Regression
analysis and length/age curves were done. Scintigraphic values were compared with
published normal ultrasonographic length.
RESULTS: Regression algorithm for the whole group of patients was length (cm) =
6.1727 age (yr)0,1535. In the first year of life the equation was length (cm) =
0.1524 age (month) + 4.568, and in 1-16 yr children it was length (cm) = 0.2644
age (yr) + 6.319. There were no significant differences between both genders or
in regards to reference ultrasonographic data.
CONCLUSION: Both renal 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy and ultrasonography are useful
tools for estimating renal size in children according age.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to identify the relationships
between the uptake of radiotracers - namely pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid
[(V)DMSA] and sestamibi (MIBI) - and the following parameters in primary breast
cancer: steroid receptor concentrations (i.e. estrogen receptor [ER] and
progesterone receptor [PR]), Ki-67 expression, tumor size, tumor grade, age, and 
levels of expression of p53 and c-erbB-2. In addition, by multivariate regression
analysis, we further isolated those factors with independent associations with
(V)DMSA and/or MIBI uptake in primary breast cancer.
METHODS: Thirty-four patients with histologically confirmed breast carcinoma
underwent preoperative scintimammography with technetium-99m (99mTc)-(V)DMSA
and/or 99mTc-MIBI in consecutive sessions 10 and 60 min after administration of
925-1110 MBq of each radiotracer. The tumor-to-background ratio was calculated
and correlated with the presence of ER, PR, Ki-67, tumor size, tumor grade, p53, 
and c-erbB-2. ER, PR, p53, and c-erbB-2 were determined immunohistochemically.
The analysis included tumor-to-background ratio of (V)DMSA and MIBI uptake as
dependent and all of the other parameters as independent variables.
RESULTS: Correlation was positive between Ki-67 and (V)DMSA (r = 0.37 at 10 min, 
P = 0.038; r = 0.42 at 60 min, P = 0.018) and inverse between PR and (V)DMSA
uptake (r = -0.46 at 10 min, P = 0.010; r = -0.51 at 60 min, P = 0.003).
Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between
Ki-67 and (V)DMSA at 60 min (P = 0.045). Ki-67 was not significantly correlated
with MIBI uptake, whereas tumor size was positively correlated with MIBI uptake
at 60 min both in univariate (r = 0.45, P = 0.027) and multivariate analysis (P =
0.024). Negative correlations were observed between (V)DMSA uptake and ER, as
well as between ER/PR and MIBI uptake, but these were not significant.
CONCLUSION: Ki-67 appears to represent the major independent factor affecting
(V)DMSA uptake in breast cancer. Tumor size was the only independent parameter
influencing MIBI uptake in breast cancer. (V)DMSA appears to have an advantage
over MIBI in that it can be used to visualize tumors with intense proliferative
activity, and thus it can identify those tumors that are more aggressive.

Pneumatic lithotripsy through pyelotomy incision during open surgery for staghorn
calculi: an alternative method to anatrophic nephrolithotomy.

INTRODUCTION: Our purpose was to remove large-volume staghorn calculi with less
morbidity and maximum ease without an anatrophic nephrolithotomy, with the use of
a pneumatic lithotriptor during pyelolithotomy to disintegrate the branches of
stones extending into the calyces and retained calyceal fragments.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients (17 renal units) with large-volume
staghorn stones were evaluated with blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine levels,
urinalysis, and culture, excretory urography (IVP), and 99mtechnetium
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy preoperatively. Patients were
treated with a pneumatic lithotriptor at the time of open pyelolithotomy.
Bilateral surgery was performed in 1 patient. The mean follow-up period was 12
(range 6-24) months. The patients were re-evaluated postoperatively at 6 months
with BUN and serum creatinine measurements, urinalysis and culture, IVP, and
renal scintigraphy with DMSA. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA test. p < 0.05 
was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: After treatment, 15 of 17 renal units (88%) were rendered stone-free
while residual fragments remained in two patients. Average operation time was 190
min (range 135-285) with a mean blood loss of 226 ml (range 140-425). No patient 
required blood transfusion. Average length of hospital stay was 4.2 days (range
3-7). Six months after surgery, mean BUN and creatinine levels were decreased
from 31.2 to 28.2 mg/dl (p = 0.248) and from 1.3 to 1.1 mg/dl (p = 0.001),
respectively. Renal scintigraphy with DMSA revealed an increase in ipsilateral
average renal function from 39 to 43% (p = 0.043). IVP also revealed a decrease
in pelvicalyceal dilatation in almost all patients with a well-functioning kidney
and without any stone recurrence. No complications were encountered
postoperatively except for an episode of high fever in 1 patient.
CONCLUSION: Avoiding incision of the renal parenchyma and arterial clamping,
without significant bleeding and the nephron loss seem to be the advantages of
this technique. Kidney function can be preserved with this simple and easily
applicable method, which may be an alternative procedure to anatrophic
nephrolithotomy for the majority of patients with staghorn calculi requiring open
surgery.

Quantitative analysis of 99mTc-DMSA during acute pyelonephritis for prediction of
long-term renal scarring.

Rouen, France.

This study was performed to evaluate a quantitative method based on (99m)Tc-DMSA 
renal planar scintigraphy performed during acute pyelonephritis (APN) to detect
kidneys at risk of scarring.METHODS: A total of 43 children (5.8 +/- 3.6 y old
[mean +/- SD]) were examined by (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy during (DMSA 1) and 8
+/- 2 mo after (DMSA 2) APN. Two levels of interpretation were performed
independently: first, a semiquantitative analysis to classify the kidneys by
considering the evolution between DMSA 1 and DMSA 2 (i.e., to determine which
kidneys had developed scarring), and second, an automatic quantitative analysis
of DMSA 1 to define and to evaluate a predictive index for kidney evolution from 
DMSA 1 to DMAS 2. The method consisted of determining an automatic threshold for 
the kidney and then calculating ratios of the count density in a given isocount
n% (region of interest containing all the pixels with a value > or = n% of the
value of the pixel with the maximal activity value) to the count density in a 20%
isocount (C(n%)) and the number of pixels in a given isocount to the number of
pixels in a 20% isocount (S(n%)).
RESULTS: All kidneys normal at DMSA 1 remained normal at DMSA 2. For the
automatic index, the C(70%) ratio was considered the best index for the
prediction of scarring. When this C(70%) ratio was used, a cutoff value of 0.45
was able to predict scarring with a sensitivity of 0.83, a specificity of 0.78, a
positive predictive value of 0.85, and a negative predictive value of 0.77.
CONCLUSION: A cutoff value of 0.45 for the C(70%) ratio calculated for
(99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy performed during APN may be useful for detecting
kidneys at risk of scarring.

Since December 1995, pediatric renal transplant recipients in our unit have
received a DMSA scan as soon as possible post-transplant in order to provide a
baseline for comparison in the event of subsequent complications. We
retrospectively reviewed the case notes and DMSA scans of the 45 patients who
underwent a scan within 9 wk of their transplant to see if pre or peri-transplant
factors or post-transplant complications were associated with defects on
scanning. Forty percentage of scans had defects. The presence of defects was not 
associated with potential predisposing factors such as patient or donor age,
cadaveric or live donation, cold ischemia time, multiple donor vessels, the use
of non-heart beating donors, the mean time to scan, the serum creatinine, or the 
presence of structural renal tract anomalies predisposing to UTI. However, 87% of
patients had complications before the scan, including UTI, rejection, acute
tubular necrosis, transplant biopsy and drug toxicity. Children with no clinical 
complications had a significantly reduced risk of a defect (p = 0.035), while
biopsy was associated with the presence of defects (p = 0.0034). Twenty patients 
had one or more follow up DMSA scans: one patient developed a new focal defect.
In conclusion, renal transplant defects are frequently found on DMSA scanning
even early after transplantation and are non-specifically associated with many

The most widely used diagnostic nuclear medicine technique in well-differentiated
thyroid cancer (DTC) is radioiodine scintigraphy, either diagnostic or
post-therapeutic, together with serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement; this
combination is usually able to determine the presence or absence of cancer.
FDG-PET has shown less sensitivity in DTC that retains the ability to trap 131I. 
Several alternative procedures with single photon emitting radiopharmaceuticals
have been evaluated including whole body scan with 201Tl, 99mTc-sestamibi or
tetrofosmin scan, with different sensitivity and specificity. The main advantage 
of these tests is that their results are not influenced by the levels of TSH,
therefore they do not require a hypothyroid state in the patient. Recently
positron emission tomography (PET) with FDG has been demonstrated to be highly
useful in thyroid cancer patients with a negative 131I whole body scan but
measurable Tg. According to reports in the literature FDG-PET in the follow-up of
operated patients has a sensitivity ranging from 70% to 90% in identifying the
source of Tg. The demonstration of lesions can lead to a change in treatment
including surgery or external radiation instead of radioiodine treatment. In
Europe, medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is currently visualized by 99mTc
pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 99mTc-sestamibi or tetrofosmin.
Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) radiolabeled with 123I or 131I is another reliable
radiopharmaceutical for medullary tumors. (111)In-pentetreotide scan is positive 
in a high percentage of patients because MTC expresses somatostatin receptors.
FDG-PET has an interesting role to play in calcitonin-positive patients, where
PET has been shown to correctly identify lesions in cervical and mediastinal
lymph nodes as well as at distant sites. Furthermore, calcitonin-guided PET has
been found to be superior to CT and MRI in many patients. Recent reports
indicated that 18F-DOPA scan in MTC seems to be more accurate than FDG-PET.

Escherichia coli DmsD interacts with the twin-arginine leader sequence of the
catalytic sub-unit (DmsA) of DMSO reductase. DmsD was purified as a mixture of a 
number of different folding forms including: dimer (A); monomer (B); a minor
thiol oxidized form; a heterogeneously folded or multi-conformational monomer
form which displayed a ladder of bands on native-PAGE (D); and proteolytically
degraded and aggregated forms. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), under
denaturing and non-denaturing conditions, was used to examine the folding and
stability of DmsD. Additionally, the biophysical methods of dynamic light
scattering, circular dichroism, fluorescence, and mass spectroscopy were also
used. Form D could be converted to form B by treatment with 4M urea, which is the
concentration at which form B begins to denature. Forms A/B could be converted to
D by incubation at pH 5.0. Forms A/B and D all had twin-arginine leader binding
activity.

Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) study has been advocated as a
method for the assessment of renal sequelae after acute febrile urinary tract
infection (UTI). However, it is not known whether DMSA scintigraphy performed
during acute UTI has any prognostic value for outcome assessment. The objective
of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of DMSA scintigraphy performed
during UTI as a predictor of patient outcome, to identify children at risk of
events [vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) or recurrent UTI] that may lead to the
development of progressive renal damage. One hundred and fifty-two children
(including 78 girls) with a mean age of 20 months (range 1 month to 12 years)
with first febrile UTI were evaluated by DMSA scintigraphy during acute UTI.
After acute UTI, children were explored by voiding cysto-urethrography. Children 
who presented an abnormal DMSA study, or a normal DMSA study but VUR or recurrent
UTI, underwent a DMSA control study 6 months after UTI. Children with VUR were
followed up by direct radionuclide cystography. DMSA scintigraphy performed
during acute UTI was normal in 112 children (74%). In 95 of these children,
follow-up DMSA scintigraphy was not performed owing to a good clinical outcome.
In the remaining 17 children, follow-up scintigraphy was normal. Forty children
(26%) presented abnormal DMSA study during acute UTI. Twenty-five of them
presented a normal follow-up DMSA, and 15 presented cortical lesions. Children
with abnormal DMSA had a higher frequency of VUR than children with normal DMSA
(48% vs 12%). It is concluded that children with normal DMSA during acute UTI
have a low risk of renal damage. Children with normal follow-up DMSA and
low-grade VUR have more frequent spontaneous resolution of VUR.

Therapeutic potential of monoisoamyl and monomethyl esters of meso
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in gallium arsenide intoxicated rats.

The dose dependent effects of monoisoamyl and monomethyl esters of meso
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mmol kg(-1),
intraperitoneally (i.p.) once daily for 5 days) to offset the characteristic
biochemical, immunological, oxidative stress consequences and DNA damage (based
on DNA fragmentation and comet assay) following sub-chronic administration of
gallium arsenide and the mobilization of gallium and arsenic were examined. The
effects of these chelators alone in normal animals too were examined on
above-mentioned variables. Male Wistar rats were exposed to 10 mg kg(-1), GaAs,
orally once daily for 12 weeks and were administered DMSA or two of its
monoesters (monoisoamyl or monomethyl) for 5 consecutive days. DMSA was used as a
positive control. DMSA and its derivatives, when given alone, generally have no
adverse effects on various parameters. After 5 days of chelation therapy in GaAs 
pre-exposed rats, MiADMSA was most effective in the reduction of inhibited blood 
delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity and zinc protoporphyrin
level while, all three chelators effectively reduced urinary ALA excretion,
compared to GaAs alone exposed rats. MiADMSA was also effective, particularly at 
a dose of 0.3 mmol kg(-1), in enhancing the inhibited hepatic transaminase
activities. Parameters indicative of oxidative stress responded less favorably to
the chelation therapy, however, three chelators significantly restored the
altered immunological variables. MiADMSA was relatively more effective than the
other two chelators. GaAs produced significant DNA damage in the liver and
kidneys and the chelation treatment had moderate but significant influence in
reducing DNA damage. All three chelators significantly reduced arsenic
concentration and, however, MiADMSA was more effective than the other two
chelators in depleting arsenic concentration from blood and other soft tissues. A
dose of 0.3 mmol kg(-1) was found to be relatively better than the other two
doses examined. Gallium contents of blood and soft tissues remained uninfluenced 
by the chelation therapy. Significant loss of copper after MiADMSA
administration, however, is of concern and requires further exploration.
Additionally, further studies are required for the choice of appropriate dose,
duration of treatment and possible toxic/side effects. Keeping in view the
promising role of MiADMSA in the treatment of GaAs poisoning, these data will be 
needed for the registration of this chelating agent as licensed drug for the
treatment of gallium arsenide intoxication.

[Total thyroidectomy in C-cell hyperplasia of the thyroid gland].

INTRODUCTION: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a neuroendocrine tumor of the 
thyroid parafollicular or C-cells. MTC accounts for approximately 3 to 5% of
thyroid carcinomas. A characteristic feature of this tumor is production of
calcitonin. Sporadic MTC accounts for 60-80% of all cases of the disease. The
most common presentation of sporadic MTC is a solitary thyroid nodule, which
occurs in 75 to 95% of patients. It typically occurs in the fifth or sixth
decades, with slight female predominance.
CASE REPORT: A case of a 58-year old woman with elevated basal calcitonin levels 
(221 pg/ml) has been presented. Preoperative ultrasound of the thyroid gland and 
body (99m)Tc DMSA scintigraphy showed a diffuse goiter. Hyperparathyroidism and
pheochromocytoma were not present. Total thyroidectomy was performed. Only C-cell
hyperplasia was found.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Many patients with elevated basal serum calcitonin
level ranging between 150 and 1000 pg/ml, have only C-cell hyperplasia, but a few
have small MTCs. For persons in known kindreds with familial MTC, prospective
screening, using serum calcitonin measurement, can identify those at risk for the
disease before MTC is clinically evident. Due to the possibility that any patient
with MTC may have multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN-2), preoperative
testing must also include measurement of serum calcium (to rule out
hyperparathyroidism) and a test for pheochromocytoma. Total thyroidectomy is
indicated in patients with high levels of calcitonin.

BACKGROUND: Columnar cell carcinoma is a rare variant of papillary thyroid
carcinoma associated with aggressive clinical behaviour.
A CASE REPORT: of a 34-year-old male patient, who presented with the rapidly
growing mass in the neck, extending to the anterior and middle mediastinum,
tightly closing the upper thoracic apperture and causing tracheal and oesophageal
deviation, with minimal compression and stenosis. A diagnosis of columnar cell
carcinoma, arising from the ectopic thyroid tissue just adjacent to the left
thyroid lobe was based on histological and intraoperative findings. Near total
thyroidectomy and lymph-node dissection were followed by external beam
radiotherapy of the neck and mediastinum, chemotherapy and radioiodine ablation
of the remaining functional thyroid tissue. Pre-and post-operative radionuclide
imaging (99mTc(V)-DMSA, 99mTc-MIBI, 123-I-mIBG and Octreoscan findings are
discussed, with a special emphasis given to the dilemmas in histological
characterisation of the tumor, the problems in therapeutic approach and the
dilemmas and pitfalls in the interpretation of radionuclide findings in this
patient, especially the ones performed post radiotherapy of the neck and
mediastinum.

Cystoscopic and DMSA findings in relation to types of reflux demonstrated on
percutaneous direct radionuclide cystography in children.

Roger M(1), Wilkinson AG.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Sciennes Road,
Edinburgh, EH9 1LF, UK.

BACKGROUND: The new technique of percutaneous direct radionuclide cystography
(PDRC) allows the accurate demonstration of vesicorenal reflux under
physiological conditions during resting and micturition phases. Five types of
reflux have been described, the clinical relevance of which is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a relationship exists between the type of reflux 
identified on PDRC and the appearance of the ureteric orifice at cystoscopy or
the prevalence of renal abnormalities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The reports of 281 PDRC examinations were reviewed and 76 
children with reflux formed the population of this study. Studies of these
children were reviewed to classify the reflux as types 1-5, and patient records
were searched for cystoscopy and DMSA scan reports.
RESULTS: Regardless of the type of reflux, the ureteric orifices were found to be
open at cystoscopy in 60-66% of refluxing units. DMSA scan abnormalities were
present in 68% of units with reflux at rest, 61% of units with reflux on
micturition and 86% of units with reflux on both resting and micturition phases. 
In comparison with contralateral units that did not reflux, the presence of
reflux had a significant association with openness of the ureteric orifice (
p<0.00001) and DMSA abnormality ( p<0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Reflux of any type is strongly associated with an open ureteric
orifice. Units that reflux during both resting and micturition phases had a
higher incidence of DMSA abnormality than those refluxing during one phase only, 
but this was not statistically significant.

Combined efficacies of lipoic acid and 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid against
lead-induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver.

Oxidative stress with subsequent lipid peroxidation has been postulated as one
mechanism for lead toxicity. Hence in assessing the protective effects of lipoic 
acid (LA) and meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on lead toxicity, they were
tested either separately or in combination for their effects on selected indices 
of hepatic oxidative stress. Elevated levels of lipid peroxides were accompanied 
by altered antioxidant defense systems. Lead acetate (Pb - 0.2%) was administered
in drinking water for five weeks to induce toxicity. LA (25 mg kg(-1) body wt.
day(-1) i.p) and DMSA (20 mg kg(-1) body wt. day(-1) i.p) were administered
individually and also in combination during the sixth week. Lead damage to the
liver was evident in the decreases in hepatic enzymes alanine transaminase
(-38%), aspartate transaminase (-42%) and alkaline phosphatase (-43%); increases 
in lipid peroxidation (+38%); decreases in the antioxidant enzymes catalase
(-45%), superoxide dismutase (-40%), glutathione peroxidase (-46%) and decreases 
in glutathione (-43%) and decreases in glutathione metabolizing enzymes,
glutathione reductase (-59%), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (-27%) and
glutathione-S-transferase (-42%). In combination LA and DMSA completely
ameliorated the lead induced oxidative damage. Either compound alone was however 
only partially protective against lead damage.

In the absence of specific symptomatology in children, the early diagnosis of
acute pyelonephritis is a challenge, particularly during infancy. In an attempt
to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary tract infection (UTI),
we measured intrarenal resistive index (RI). We evaluated its ability to predict 
renal involvement as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. In 
total 157 patients admitted to the pediatric department of the Sişli Etfal
Hospital with clinical signs of febrile UTI were included in the study. The
children were divided into groups according to their age at the time of
ultrasonography (US). RI was measured from the renal arteries with Doppler US in 
the first 72 h in all 157 children. Renal involvement was assessed by
(99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy in the first 7 days after admission. The examination
was repeated at least 6 months later if the first result was abnormal. All
available patients with an abnormal scintigraphy underwent voiding
cystourethrography 4-6 weeks after the acute infection. All patients with
vesicoureteral reflux and scarred kidneys were excluded from the study. DMSA
scintigraphy demonstrated abnormal changes in 114 of 157 children and was normal 
in the remaining 43 children. Of these 114 children, 104 underwent repeat
scintigraphy, of whom 77 showed partially or totally reversible lesion(s). Of
these 77 children, 17 children (22%) with vesicoureteral reflux were excluded.
Thus, we compared the 43 children with lower UTI with the 60 children with
definite acute pyelonephritis at admission. Kidneys with changes of acute
pyelonephritis had a mean RI of 0.744+/-0.06 in infants, 0.745+/-0.03 in
preschool children, and 0.733+/-0.09 in patients of school age with upper UTI.
However, the mean RI was 0.703+/-0.06 in infants, 0.696+/-0.1 in preschool
children, and 0.671+/-0.09 in school-aged patients with lower UTI. The mean RI
values were significantly higher in patients with upper UTI ( P<0.001). There was
a highly significant correlation between RI values and the severity of the renal 
lesion as ranked by DMSA scintigraphy ( P<0.001). When the cut-off RI value was
0.715, there was an 80% sensitivity and a 89% specificity for diagnosing upper
UTI. Refluxing kidneys and scarred kidneys also had higher RI values. In
conclusion, RI values were increased significantly in children with febrile UTI
when renal parenchymal involvement (assessed by DMSA scintigraphy) was present.
Our results also support the view that the children with high RI values are at a 
high risk of reflux, scarring, or both, which was frequently observed in febrile 
UTI. This might allow identification of patients at risk for severe renal lesions
that require more aggressive therapy, investigation, and follow-up than those
with lower UTI.

Renal abscess in children: a clinical retrospective study.

Wang YT(1), Lin KY, Chen MJ, Chiou YY.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, 138,
Sheng-Li Road, Tainan 704, Taiwan.

A renal abscess is rare in children and diagnosis is not readily apparent before 
hospitalization, because symptoms are often insidious and nonspecific. To
evaluate the diagnostics and therapy of renal abscess in the pediatric group, we 
will report eight cases of renal abscess in children to illustrate the variable
features of this condition. Eight patients, 6 to 156 (mean, 45.9) months old,
with renal abscesses in 9 kidneys were identified. Ultrasound and computed
tomography proved to be the most valuable diagnostic tool, revealing a hypoechoic
or hypodense mass. Fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis were common presenting
features, but no child presented symptoms of loin pain. Escherichia coli was
identified in the urine culture among the 6 cases and blood culture in one case. 
Three children were associated with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux. All
patients had an intensive antibiotic treatment, which led to resolution of the
abscess in eight of the nine kidneys. In one case, the abscess had to be drained 
using the CT-guided percutaneous drainage. During follow-up, seven children
received 99mTc DMSA renal SPECT and only two of them had complete remission
without sequelae of renal scar. We concluded that the renal abscesses must be
assumed, especially, in children with prolonged fever, abdominal pain, and a high
value of CRP. Ultrasonography is just a screening test to detect renal swelling, 
bulging, and enlargement; however, a CT scan is more sensitive and can detect
abscess formation, as well as define the extent of the disease for planning
conservative antibiotic treatment or additional drainage. Finally, DMSA renal
SPECT is the best and the most sensitive examination for detecting the extension 
area of renal inflammation and correlated with the renal outcome.

Arsenic uptake by native fern species in Thailand: effect of chelating agents on 
hyperaccumulation of arsenic by Pityrogramma calomelanos.

Nineteen native fern species collected from an area in Thailand with high arsenic
concentration in soil and in ground water as a result of tin mining was screened 
for elevated arsenic concentration in fronds. Two species of fern were found to
contain elevated arsenic in their fronds in nature: Pityrogramma calomelanos
(108-1156 microg g(-1) dried weight) and Pteris vittata (79 microg g(-1) dried
weight). Under hydroponic culture Pityrogramma calomelanos (a silver back fern)
accumulated arsenic in its shoot at rate of 4616 microg(-1) (dried weight). The
accumulation of arsenic in Pityrogramma calomelanos shoot doubled with the
addition of an EDTA (Ethelenediamine tetraacetic acid) chelating agent. The
highest accumulation occurred 6 weeks after exposure to 10 mg L(-1) arsenic as
disodium hydrogen arsenate. The addition of another chelating agent, DMS
(Dimercaptosuccinic acid), resulted in a 5-fold decrease in arsenic concentration
in the Pityrogramma calomelanos shoot compared to control after 6 weeks of
exposure to arsenic. The contrasting effect of the EDTA and DMSA chelating agent 
was attributed to the strong binding of the thiol group to arsenic ion. This
study indicated that Pityrogramma calomelanos uptake and translocate arsenic in
the form of arsenate and arsenite rather than the As-DMSA complex. Using
phytoextraction efficiency calculations, it was determined that Pityrogramma
calomelanos gave the highest arsenic phytoextraction efficiency at 6 weeks after 
exposure to arsenic in the EDTA treatment, with an efficiency of 77.8 mg As based
on whole plant biomass.

standard.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan is presently the technique of choice
for assessing renal scars. Recent advances suggest that ultrasonography could
replace DMSA scan for this purpose. This paper describes the experience of a
tertiary pediatric referral hospital performing ultrasonography and DMSA scans in
the assessment of renal scarring. Investigations were conducted 3-6 months after 
patients presented with urinary tract infection (UTI). Results were extracted
from the radiology information system and recorded for analysis. All children
with a UTI who had undergone DMSA and ultrasound examination on the same day
between January 1995 and December 1999 were included; 930 kidneys were compared. 
DMSA scan was utilized as the reference method. When used to detect focal renal
scarring, ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 5.2%, specificity of 98.3%, a
positive predictive value (PPV) of 50% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of
75.8%. When used to detect diffuse renal scarring, ultrasonography had a
sensitivity of 47.2%, specificity of 91.8%, PPV of 60.8% and NPV of 86.6%. Our
results demonstrate that although ultrasonography has a good specificity for the 
detection of renal scarring compared with DMSA, it has low sensitivity, PPV and
NPV. Ultrasonography cannot be substituted for DMSA scan in the evaluation of
focal renal scarring.

Children with fully recessive (Type I/I) cystinuria have a high risk of stone
formation in the first decade of life. To assess the tendency for cystine to
precipitate in individual urine samples, we developed an in vitro assay in which 
radiolabelled cystine (4mM) was dissolved in urine at 37 degrees C after
alkalization to pH 10. Samples were then brought to pH 5, cooled, and
centrifuged. The % decrease in supernatant cpm was used as a measure of cystine
precipitation (CP). CP varied widely among normal children (74%+/-34) whereas
variability of repeated determinations on a single adult individual was modest
(64%+/-3.3). The assay was used to compare various potential therapies for
cystinuria. Precipitation of exogenous cystine from normal urine was strongly
inhibited by addition of D-penicillamine (CP: 8%+/-3) or dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA) (CP: 5%+/-1), at urinary concentrations attained by standard oral doses of
each drug. Mercaptopropionylglycine (MPG) was moderately effective (CP: 43%+/-9),
whereas captopril was a weak inhibitor (CP: 63%+/-12). Precipitation of
endogenous cystine (2191 micromol/L) from a cystinuric patient showed that DMSA
and D-penicillamine were again highly effective compared to the other agents. In 
addition DMSA and penicillamine added to the same patient's urine reduced the
free cystine by 50% (as measured by automated amino acid analyzer) whereas MPG
and captopril had no effect. In conclusion, DMSA is comparable to D-penicillamine
as an in vitro inhibitor.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to compare the results of direct radionuclide
cystography (DRNC) and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in a group of children
with a high suspicion of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
METHODS: For this purpose, 25 children were studied with both VCUG and DRNC.
Among 50 ureter units able to be compared 39 ureter units did not show any VUR on
either study. Eleven ureter units (10 children) had VUR either on one study or on
both (VCUG and DRNC). In the children who had VUR on either study, a
dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) was performed to determine their
cortical function.
RESULTS: We identified the following four patterns: 1) Five ureter units (five
children) read positive on DRNC who were negative on VCUG and four of these
children had positive findings on DMSA; 2) Four ureter units (four children) read
positive on VCUG who were negative on DRNC, and two of them had positive findings
on DMSA; 3) Two ureters (one child) read positive in both studies and also had
abnormal DMSA findings; 4) Thirty-nine ureter units read as negative on both
studies.
CONCLUSION: Although the results of these two methods did not show a significant 
difference, DRNC offers a high sensitivity in the younger age group whereas VCUG 
seems to be more sensitive in the older age group. DRNC also offers continuous
recording during the study, ease of assessment and lower radiation dose to the
gonads, which makes it a preferable method for the initial diagnosis and
follow-up of VUR.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence of abnormal results in DMSA renal
scintigraphy indicates pyelonephritis. METHODS: We performed the washout test in 
17 children with urinary tract infection, as a criterion standard, to locate the 
infection site. All the children underwent DMSA renal scintigraphy in the acute
phase of the disease. The results were analyzed by the chi-square test or Fisher 
test. RESULTS: DMSA renal scintigraphy revealed changes in all five cases of
pyelonephritis, suggesting acute kidney involvement. On the other hand, only one 
child with cystitis (total = 12 cases) had abnormal results in renal
scintigraphy. Sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 92%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: DMSA renal scintigraphy is a sensitive method for the diagnosis of
pyelonephritis in children.

Interaction between metals and chelating agents affects glutamate binding on
brain synaptic membranes.

The present study investigates the possible effects of Hg2+, Pb2+, and Cd2+ on
[3H]-glutamate binding. To better understand the role of the thiol-disulfide
status on the toxicity of such metals toward glutamatergic neurotransmission, we 
used three thiol chelating agents, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BAL),
2,3-dimercaptopropane 1-sulfonate (DMPS), and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA). Dithiotreitol (DTT) was tested for its ability to prevent metals-induced 
inhibition on [3H]-glutamate binding. Hg2+, Pb2+, and Cd2+ showed a
concentration-dependent inhibition on [3H]-glutamate binding, and mercury was the
most effective inhibitor. BAL did not prevent [3H]-glutamate binding inhibition
by Hg2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+. However, DMPS and DMSA prevented the inhibition caused
by Cd2+ and Pb2+, but not by Hg2+. DTT did not prevent the inhibition on
[3H]-glutamate binding caused by 10 microM Hg2+. In contrast, it was able to
partially prevent [3H]-glutamate binding inhibition caused by 40 microM Pb2+ and 
Cd2+. These results demonstrated that the heavy metals present an inhibitory
effect on [3H]-glutamate binding. In addition, BAL was less effective to protect 
[3H]-glutamate binding inhibition caused by these metals than other chelating
agents studied.

Identification of dimethyl sulfoxide reductase in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae
and its role in infection.

Baltes N(1), Hennig-Pauka I, Jacobsen I, Gruber AD, Gerlach GF.

School of Hannover, Germany. nbaltes@gmx.de

Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, 
is capable of persisting in oxygen-deprived surroundings, namely, tonsils and
sequestered necrotic lung tissue. Utilization of alternative terminal electron
acceptors in the absence of oxygen is a common strategy in bacteria under
anaerobic growth conditions. In an experiment aimed at identification of genes
expressed in vivo, the putative catalytic subunit DmsA of anaerobic dimethyl
sulfoxide reductase was identified in an A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 7 strain.
The 90-kDa protein exhibits 85% identity to the putative DmsA protein of
Haemophilus influenzae, and its expression was found to be upregulated under
anaerobic conditions. Analysis of the unfinished A. pleuropneumoniae genome
sequence revealed putative open reading frames (ORFs) encoding DmsB and DmsC
proteins situated downstream of the dmsA ORF. In order to investigate the role of
the A. pleuropneumoniae DmsA protein in virulence, an isogenic deletion mutant,
A. pleuropneumoniae DeltadmsA, was constructed and examined in an aerosol
infection model. A. pleuropneumoniae DeltadmsA was attenuated in acute disease,
which suggests that genes involved in oxidative metabolism under anaerobic
conditions might contribute significantly to A. pleuropneumoniae virulence.

Split renal function does not change after successful treatment in children with 
primary vesico-ureteric reflux.

Maternal and Child Health, Osaka, Japan. fumim@mch.pref.osaka.jp

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the renal growth pattern in patients with primary
vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) using long-term measurements of split renal function
with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 712 children aged < 16 years (466 boys and 246
girls) with primary VUR were referred to our hospital from July 1991 to December 
2000. VUR was diagnosed by voiding cysto-urethrography. The patients were treated
either surgically (group 1) or conservatively (group 2) and followed with serial 
99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy for up to 10 years. There were 942 examinations in 367 of
712 patients who had repeat scintigraphy. Patients with secondary VUR, VUR to a
solitary or fused kidney, or upper urinary tract obstruction, were excluded. Five
of 298 patients (1.7%) who had ureteric reimplantation had a febrile urinary
tract infection (UTI) soon after surgery but none recurred (recurrence is an
indication for surgery in children with VUR); there was no febrile UTI in the 69 
patients in group 2. Planar scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA was used to assess the
absolute uptake (AU) of each kidney, measured as a percentage of the injected
dose, and the relative uptake (RU = AU of each kidney/AU of both kidneys)
calculated. The initial examination was at least 4 weeks after any febrile UTI in
most patients. Serial studies were conducted 1 year after surgery and then
biannually in group 1. In group 2 the DMSA scan was repeated every 2-3 years. The
change in split renal function was compared with the RU of the right kidney.
RESULTS: The RU of the right kidney at the initial scan correlated closely with
those on repeated scans in both groups. The correlation coefficients were 0.99 in
group 1 and 0.94-0.97 in group 2 at every study. The change of RU remained within
0.05 in all patients after treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Under strict control of UTI, split renal function in children with
primary VUR does not change. There may be no possibility of accelerated or
compensatory growth of the kidney with reflux nephropathy, but no concern about
deterioration and atrophy either.

The multidrug resistance of in vitro tumor cell lines derived from human breast
carcinoma MCF-7 does not influence pentavalent technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic 
Acid uptake.

The main causes of multidrug resistance (MDR) are overexpression of
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein isoform 1
(MRP1) often associated with high levels of glutathione (GSH). We investigated
whether MDR phenotype can influence Tc-99m-(V)-DMSA [pentavalent
technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid] entry by comparing its uptake with that
of Tc-99m-sestamibi (MIBI) on an in vitro model of sensitive (MCF-7) and variant 
resistant cell lines. Drug resistance was assessed by immunoblotting, GSH
measurement, and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5,diphenyl tetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay. To correlate MDR phenotype with tracer accumulation, uptakes were
performed with and without P-gp and MRP1 inhibitors and after GSH modulation.
Similar accumulation of Tc-99m-(V)-DMSA was observed in all cell lines and the
use of MDR reversals did not enhance its uptake. Our results demonstrate clearly 
that Tc-99m-(V)-DMSA uptake is not related to either P-gp and MRP1 expression, or
GSH levels. In contrast, Tc-99m-MIBI accumulation is inversely proportional to
the cell MDR phenotype. The combination of Tc-99m-(V)-DMSA and Tc-99m-MIBI may be
a useful tool for noninvasive detection of malignant sites and their
chemoresistance status.

Ascorbic acid supplementation does not improve efficacy of
meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid treatment in lead-exposed suckling rats.

Health, Zagreb, Croatia. vvarnai@imi.hr

It was suggested that ascorbic acid as a natural chelating agent can influence
lead toxicokinetics and improve chelating properties of dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) in adult rats. In this paper potential benefits of ascorbic acid
supplementation, alone or combined with DMSA, in decreasing lead retention in
suckling rats were evaluated. Such data in young mammals are not available.
L-Ascorbic acid (daily dose 650 mg/kg b.wt.) and/or DMSA (daily dose 91 mg/kg
b.wt.) were administered orally to suckling Wistar rats either during ongoing
8-day oral lead exposure (as acetate; daily dose 2 mg lead/kg b.wt.) or after
3-day lead exposure (total dose 12 mg lead/kg b.wt.). Lead concentrations were
analysed in the carcass (skeleton), liver, kidneys and brain by atomic absorption
spectrometry. By ascorbic acid supplementation lead retention was not reduced
under either lead exposure condition. Lead concentration was even increased in
the carcass. Treatment with DMSA under both exposure conditions significantly
reduced lead in all analysed tissues. Combined treatment with ascorbic acid and
DMSA during ongoing lead exposure was substantially less effective than DMSA
treatment alone, and did not affect DMSA efficacy when administered after lead
exposure. It was concluded that ascorbic acid administered either during or after
lead exposure in suckling rats has no beneficial effect on either lead retention 
or DMSA chelation effectiveness.

Author information:

Terrace, Adelaide 5000, Australia. ctsopela@mail.rah.sa.gov.au

The chemistry of antimony trisulphide colloid (ATC) was examined to elucidate the
radiolabelling mechanism with 99mTcO4(-). Ion exchange chromatography and atomic 
absorption spectrophotometry techniques determined ATC to be resistant to
hydrolysis in 0.1M hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 25 degrees C or 100 degrees C (>97%
recovery, Sb3+ absent). Hydrogen sulphide gas detected did not participate in the
mechanism, where antimony trisulphide and 99mTcO4(-) in HCl/100 degrees C yielded
96% 99mTc-product from a K2S-free formulation (versus 98% when K2S was present). 
99mTcO4(-) was reduced >90% by DMSA or dithiothreitol under the same conditions, 
identifying involvement of thiol groups. Infrared analysis of Re-ATC showed S=O
bonds, indicating excess thiol groups at the colloid surface were oxidised at the
expense of 99mTcO4(-) reduction.

The value of (123)I-hippuran (OIH) renal sequential scintigraphy (RSS) in
predicting the evolution of defects detected by (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scanning during a first episode of acute pyelonephritis (APN) was
assessed.METHODS: Fifty-eight children with APN underwent (99m)Tc-DMSA planar
scanning and (123)I-OIH RSS during acute infection and at least 5 mo later. Renal
lesions found by (99m)Tc-DMSA scanning were classified according to the following
(99m)Tc-DMSA grading system: 0 = normal, 1 = 1 lesion, 2 = 2 lesions, and 3 =
diffuse damage with renal parenchymal subversion. Renal scarring was diagnosed
whenever a renal cortical defect detected at the first (99m)Tc-DMSA examination
persisted on the follow-up (99m)Tc-DMSA examination. Single-kidney clearance rate
(Cl) was evaluated by a method that was previously validated at our institution
and is based on time-activity curves measured on the heart and kidney areas by
the region-of-interest technique.
RESULTS: (99m)Tc-DMSA scanning showed renal damage in 76 kidneys and had negative
findings for the remaining 40 kidneys (2 patients had bilaterally negative
findings). (99m)Tc-DMSA scanning determined 40 kidneys to be grade 0, 49 to be
grade 1, 21 to be grade 2, and 6 to be grade 3. For (99m)Tc-DMSA grades of 0-3,
the corresponding Cl mean values (in mL/min/1.73 m(2) of body surface area [BSA])
were 292 +/- 33, 237 +/- 39, 210 +/- 54, and 140 +/- 53, respectively. The
Spearman regression coefficient (R) demonstrated a significant correlation
between (99m)Tc-DMSA grade and Cl (R = 0.69, P < 0.0001). Thirty-six of the
lesions detected by staging (99m)Tc-DMSA were shown to have recovered on
follow-up renal scans, whereas 40 developed scars. A significant difference in Cl
was found between the 2 groups (P < 0.0002). The Cl cutoff value was determined
by univariate discriminant analysis; a Cl value of 232 mL/min/1.73 m(2) of BSA
discriminated best between scarred and nonscarred kidneys, with a specificity,
sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall
accuracy of 95%, 95%, 90%, 97%, and 95%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Cl evaluation, in the course of acute urinary tract infection, is
highly valuable in predicting the fibrotic evolution of renal damage detected on 
acute (99m)Tc-DMSA scanning. Also, our data show close agreement between Cl and
the grade determined by staging (99m)Tc-DMSA.

Yugoslavia. jaksic@beotel.yu

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the interobserver variability
and reproducibility of the renal scintigraphy reports.
METHODS: The study was prospective performed in 60 99mTc DMSA scintigraphies (116
kidneys), done in one centre, displayed on X ray films as analogue 300 kcounts
images in 4 standard projections. Six observers from 4 different centres (group
A), including three observers from one institution (group B), were asked to
interpret original scans. Seven parameters of scintigraphy protocol were analysed
with at least two responses: kidney size (1), uptake (2), outlines (3), scars
(4), SOL (5), differential function (6) and conclusion (7).
RESULTS: Among 116 kidneys, concordant results in interpretation of seven points 
of report from 1 to 7, in the group A were found in 62%, 42.5%, 45%, 9%, 47%, 52%
and 34%, and In the group B in 72%, 55%, 59%, 22%, 62%, 60% and 41% respectively.
Some improvement in concordant reporting was noted in the group of 3 observers,
in comparison of group of all, statistically significant in category of scar
reports (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest to use of standardised criteria and terminology in
interpretations, to improve low interobserver reproducibility and objectivity of 
renal scintigraphy reports, particularly in evaluation of renal scars.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the relation between (99m)Tc-DMSA
biodistribution and its reliability as a marker of renal function in patients
with glomerular kidney diseases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients involved in this study were classified
into two groups according to (99m)Tc-DTPA clearance and serum creatinine values: 
the 1st group consisted of 42 patients without renal failure while the 2nd group 
included 25 patients with renal failure. (99m)Tc-DMSA biodistribution was
determined by measuring kidney, blood and urine activity at 2 h and 4 h.
RESULTS: The results, compared with those of 23 healthy volunteers, indicated the
quantitative alteration of (99m)Tc-DMSA distribution in both glomerulonephritis
patient groups. In reference to the control mean values of 2 h and 4 h, in
patients without renal failure, kidney activity was found decreased to 52% and
57%, while the blood activity increase of 37% and 44% was recorded together with 
the urine activity increase of 38% and 23%. In patients with renal failure the
alterations of renal and blood activity were more remarkable, but the urine loss 
was found to be unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that these biodistribution changes originate mainly 
from tubular impairment. However, in glomerulonephritis patients, altered
glomerular filtration might considerably affect biodistribution of this
radiopharmaceutical and limits its suitability for precise quantitative
estimation of renal function.

[Production and therapeutic use of rhenium-186, 188--the future of
radionuclides].

[Article in Croatian]

INTRODUCTION: In contemporary nuclear medicine, alpha, pure beta or beta-gamma
emitters are used for targeted therapy. Use of pure and combined alpha/beta
emitters in oncology, endocrinology, rheumatology and, a short while ago,
interventional cardiology, has refined as an important alternative to more common
therapeutic regimens. Two radioisotopes of rhenium, rhenium-186 and rhenium-188, 
are of particular interest. PRODUCTION OF RHENIUM-186 AND RHENIUM-188:
Rhenium-186 is routinely produced in nuclear reactors by direct neutron
activation of metallic rhenium enriched with 185Re via 185Re(n,) 186Re nuclear
reaction. For production of 188Re the target is 186W. 188W is produced by double 
neutron capture which gives 188Re due to beta decay. Separation of 188Re is
performed in generators by column chromatography, extraction or by gel
technology. The best results are obtained using chromatographic 188W/188Re
generator in which 188W is adsorbed on aluminium. Rhenium-188 is eluted in saline
solution.
RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS LABELED WITH RHENIUM RADIOISOTOPES AND THEIR CLINICAL
APPLICATIONS: There are several fields of applications of radiopharmaceuticals
labeled with 186,188Re. For bone pain palliation the most often used are
186Re-HEDP and 188Re-DMSA. For synovectomy, 186Re-sulphide in kit form is already
commercially available. Endovascular radiation therapy is performed by using
188Re-perrhenate or 188Re-MAG3. Labeling of peptides and antibodies with 188Re is
also reported. Application of rhenium radiosotopes depends on their specific
activity. Rhenium-186,188 of low specific activity can be used only for labeling 
of particles or diphosphonates. However, labeling of peptides or antibodies can
be performed only by using 188Re of high specific activity.
CONCLUSION: 188Re is expected to have wide applications after development of a
chromatographic 188W/188Re generator. One of the advantages of rhenium is tis
chemical similarity with technetium. So technetium analogues labeled with
186,188Re can be developed for several specific applications.

Author information:

andstark@hotmail.com

The authors present a case of accidental intrathecal mercury application. A
69-year-old white woman was admitted to our department with suspected meningitis 
following surgery for spinal stenosis at another hospital. Postoperatively, she
had developed a cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) fistula with a subcutaneous cavity.
Local wound irritation had been suspected and, unfortunately, mercury-containing 
disinfectant was injected into the cavity. Within 24 h the patient demonstrated
acute neurological deterioration due to meningitis and encephalitis and was
admitted to our clinic with suspected meningitis due to postoperative CSF
fistula. Lumbar puncture revealed desinfectant-stained, non-bloody CSF, while
lumbar MRI demonstrated the large lumbar subcutaneous cavity. Additionally, CSF
fistula was visualized on MRI. Laboratory examination revealed extremely high
mercury levels in CSF, blood and urine. Treatment consisted in insertion of a
lumbar drainage to wash out the mercury. The patient underwent medical
detoxication using chelating agents (DMPS: RS-2,3-dimercapto-1-propansulfonacid, 
DMSA: meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinatacid). Surgery was performed in order to close
the cavity and the fistula. Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the
intensive care unit and remained intubated for 3 days. Within 4 weeks after
surgery, she demonstrated good recovery. Eighteen months after intoxication,
polyneuropathy and slight neuropsychological deficiencies were detectable.

Reversal of cadmium induced oxidative stress by chelating agent, antioxidant or
their combination in rat.

The influence of an antioxidant agent such as N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or mannitol
on the cadmium chelating ability of monoisoamyl 2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (MiADMS) 
was investigated in cadmium pre-exposed rats. This ester of
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), an accepted drug for lead poisoning, being
lipophilic in nature was expected to be an efficient cadmium chelator. The
treatment of cadmium intoxicated animals with MiADMS reversed cadmium induced
increase in blood catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA),
liver MDA and brain SOD and MDA levels but not the decrease in blood, liver brain
reduced glutathione (GSH) and increase in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels,
consistent with the lowering of tissue cadmium burden. The administration of NAC 
or mannitol reversed the cadmium induced alterations in blood and liver GSH,
GSSG, blood catalase, SOD, MDA, liver SOD, MDA and brain MDA levels without
lowering blood and tissue cadmium contents. However, treatments with the
combination of MiADMS and NAC or MiADMS and mannitol reversed these alterations
as well as reduced blood and tissue cadmium concentrations. The combined
treatment with MiADMS and mannitol was better than that with MiADMS and NAC, and 
was significantly more effective in normalizing blood, liver GSH, GSSG, brain
GSSG, and their GSH/GSSG ratios than that by either of them alone. The combined
treatments also improved liver and brain endogenous zinc levels, which were
decreased due to cadmium toxicity. The results suggest that the administration of
an antioxidant during chelation of cadmium may provide beneficial effects by
reducing oxidative stress without its cadmium removing ability.

Novel tumortropic ester derivatives of 99mTc(V) mesodimercapto succinic acid with
low affinity for bone tissue.

Radiopharmazeutische Chemie, Dresden, Germany. S.Seifert@fz-rossendorf.de

Starting from our previous finding that 99mTc(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc(V)-DMSA), a useful agent for the localization of osteosarcoma and bone
metastases, loses its bone affinity when one ester group is introduced into the
complex we studied the impact of esterification in more detail. This paper
reports on the evaluation of various ester complexes of 99mTc(V)-DMSA in rats and
tumour-bearing nude mice with regard to their tumour retention and improvement of
the tumour to tissue ratios. The distribution patterns of the complexes
[99mTcO(DMSA)2]- (A), [99mTcO(DMSA/DMSEt)]- (B) and [99mTcO(DMSEt)2]- (C) are
gradually changed with the number of ester groups in the anionic complex.
However, the asymmetric diester complex [99mTcO(DMSA/DMSEt2)]- (D) is very slowly
cleared, especially from the blood of nude mice. Moreover, this complex differs
significantly from the symmetrical complex C in its elimination behaviour from
the liver and kidneys. The tumour uptake is maintained with complexes that
contain one or two non-hydrolysable ester functions. Preliminary biodistribution 
studies of the monoethyl and diethyl ester complexes B, C and D in comparison
with A in tumour-bearing nude mice showed similar uptake into the human squamous 
cell carcinoma (FaDu) as well as into the human colonic cell carcinoma (HT29) of 
nude mice. The low bone accumulation of B, C and D results in excellent
tumour-to-bone ratios, e.g., approx. 3:1 for the ester complex B compared to
approx. 1:2 for complex A. Differences were observed in the accumulation and
elimination behaviour of the complexes A and B in various bone structures of
rats. The age-dependent uptake of A and B was compared in long bone (femur) and
in cranial bone of rats. The results suggest that 99mTc(V)-DMSA complexes that
contain a functional ester, and their 188Re analogues, may be superior to
99mTc(V)/188Re(V)-DMSA in diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine.

High-grade of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been reported in association with
prenatal diagnosis of abnormal bladder function in a male neonate with
postpatally no anatomical urethral obstruction and bladder dysfunction. This
study was designed to describe clinical presentation of this entity in male
neonates, the urodynamic pattern, prognosis in terms of renal function and
therapeutic management since birth, in our experience with four cases.MATERIALS
AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of 4 male neonates diagnosed at birth of
bilateral high-grade VUR (grade > or = 4) with prenatally diagnosed
hydronephrosis; thus 8 refluxing renal units (RRU) were studied. All cases had
renal failure at birth. In all cases dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renography
was performed. All RRU had reflux nephropathy; 5 RRU had moderate impairment of
renal function (20-40%). In 3 RUU was demonstrated by a severe decrease in renal 
function (10-20% in 2 RUU, and less than 10% in 1 RUU). Micturating
cystouretrography (MCUG) excluded the presence of posterior urethral valves;
however, in all cases a tightened bladder neck ("bladder neck impression") was
present. Endoscopy was performed in one baby excluding posterior urethral valves.
Follow up ranged from 2 to 5 years (mean 3.5).
RESULTS: In all 4 cases underwent transient urinary diversion during their first 
month of life. Urodynamic study revealed a high-risk bladder with low compliance,
a reduced functional bladder capacity and a high residual urine volume in all
cases. All the patients was placed on antibiotic prophylaxis and oral oxybutinin 
chloride. Three patients underwent bilateral Cohen ureteral reimplantation. The
other boy underwent left nephrectomy, right Politano ureteral reimplantation and 
ureterocystoplasty. In the 7 RRU postoperative MCUG revealed cessation of reflux.
Currently therapy includes antibiotic prophylaxis in 4, oral oxybutinin in 4 and 
intermittent catheterisation in 2 patients. 3 patients have normal renal
function. The other boy underwent re-diversion because of renal failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Fetal severe bilateral reflux nephropathy is a clinical entity
almost exclusively in male neonate mimicking hyper-pressure syndrome due to
urethral obstruction, in terms of evolution (to chronification and renal failure)
and treatment (that requires primordial management of bladder dysfunction).
Absence of anatomical urethral obstruction and urodynamic pattern suggest
functional obstruction of bladder neck-periurethral sphincter complex in fetal
life as a cause for this syndrome. For this reason we consider it as a clinical
presentation of fetal non-coordinated voiding in male or "posterior urethral
valves like syndrome".

Evidence that 99mTc-(V)-DMSA uptake is mediated by NaPi cotransporter type III in
tumour cell lines.

In vivo studies have demonstrated that pentavalent technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid [(99m)Tc-(V)-DMSA] may be a useful tumour imaging agent. 
Several studies have suggested that (99m)Tc-(V)-DMSA uptake may be related to the
structural similarity between the (99m)Tc-(V)-DMSA core and the PO(4)(3-) anion. 
As phosphate ions enter cells via NaPi cotransporters, we investigated whether
(99m)Tc-(V)-DMSA uptake is mediated by NaPi cotransporters. (99m)Tc-(V)-DMSA and 
phosphate uptake kinetics were compared in three cancer cell lines (MCF-7, G152
and MG-63) under several conditions (with and without sodium and NaPi
cotransporter inhibitor and at different pH). Determination of molecular NaPi
cotransporter mRNA expression was performed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (Rt-PCR) assay. Results obtained in the presence of NaPi
inhibitor, in sodium-free medium and at alkaline pH showed that (99m)Tc-(V)-DMSA 
accumulation is linked to NaPi cotransporter functionality. MCF-7 and G152
exhibited the same tracer uptake, whereas MG-63 showed the highest phosphate
accumulation and the lowest (99m)Tc-(V)-DMSA uptake. These results were in
accordance with mRNA NaPi expression, i.e. all cell lines expressed NaPi type III
but MG-63 also co-expressed NaPi type I. The total level of NaPi cotransporter
was highly correlated with phosphate accumulation, while the level of type III
was related to (99m)Tc-(V)-DMSA uptake. We have demonstrated that
(99m)Tc-(V)-DMSA uptake is specifically mediated by NaPi type III in cancer
cells.

[Study on the effect of NaFeEDTA on preventing lead poisoning in rats and its
impact on zinc, copper].

[Article in Chinese]

Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.

In order to explore the effect of sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate
(NaFeEDTA) on preventing rats from lead poisoning and reducing the lead toxicity,
and at the same time to explore its impact on zinc and copper, sixty Wistar rats 
were randomly divided into six groups including blank control group, model
control group, positive control group and three different level NaFeEDTA (high,
middle and low) groups. With the exception of the blank control group, which only
received double distilled water treatment throughout the experiment, all the
other rats were continuously treated with lead solution. At the same time, with
the exception of the blank and model control groups, the other four groups were
treated with acidi dimercaptosuccinici (DMSA), high, middle and low level
NaFeEDTA solutions respectively. At the end of the study, several indicators were
determined. The results showed that the hemoglobin levels in the three different 
level NaFeEDTA groups were significantly higher than those of the other four
groups and at the same time the lead levels in blood and organs were lower than
those of model group significantly. There were significant reverse correlations
between iron supplement and the lead levels in liver, kidney and tibia among the 
three different level NaFeEDTA groups, and the correlation coefficients were
-0.4432, -0.6134 and -0.3878 respectively. There were no significant differences 
in zinc levels and copper levels between the three level NaFeEDTA groups and the 
negative control group except the brain zinc levels in the middle and high level 
NaFeEDTA groups were lower and the kidney copper level in the low level NaFeEDTA 
group was higher than those of the model control group. It is concluded that the 
NaFeEDTA can effectively improve hemoglobin level, prevent rats from lead
poisoning and reduce the lead toxicity. At the same time, NaFeEDTA does not have 
significant influence on zinc and copper levels in rats.

Associations of renal function with polymorphisms in the delta-aminolevulinic
acid dehydratase, vitamin D receptor, and nitric oxide synthase genes in Korean
lead workers.

We analyzed data from 798 lead workers to determine whether polymorphisms in the 
genes encoding delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), endothelial nitric
oxide synthase (eNOS), and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) were associated with or
modified relations of lead exposure and dose measures with renal outcomes. Lead
exposure was assessed with job duration, blood lead, dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA)-chelatable lead, and tibia lead. Renal function was assessed with blood
urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, measured creatinine clearance, calculated 
creatinine clearance and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), and
retinol-binding protein. Mean (+/- SD) tibia lead, blood lead, and
DMSA-chelatable lead levels were 37.2 +/- 40.4 microg/g bone mineral, 32.0 +/-
15.0 microg/dL, and 767.8 +/- 862.1 microg/g creatinine, respectively. After
adjustment, participants with the ALAD(2) allele had lower mean serum creatinine 
and higher calculated creatinine clearance. We observed effect modification by
ALAD on associations between blood lead and/or DMSA-chelatable lead and three
renal outcomes. Among those with the ALAD(1-2) genotype, higher lead measures
were associated with lower BUN and serum creatinine and higher calculated
creatinine clearance. Participants with the eNOS variant allele were found to
have higher measured creatinine clearance and BUN. In participants with the Asp
allele, longer duration working with lead was associated with higher serum
creatinine and lower calculated creatinine clearance and NAG; all were
significantly different from relations in those with the Glu/Glu genotype except 
NAG (p = 0.08). No significant differences were seen in renal outcomes by VDR
genotype, nor was consistent effect modification observed. The ALAD findings
could be explained by lead-induced hyperfiltration.

Long-term outcome of acute pyelonephritis (AP) in adults is unknown. We evaluated
the frequency of renal damage 10-20 years after hospitalization for AP in adult
women and the utility of technetium Tc 99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc
99m-DMSA) scanning for detection of renal scars; 63 of 203 women hospitalized
with AP during 1982-1992 were included in the study. Tc 99m-DMSA scanning
detected renal scarring in 29 women (46%). Multivariate analysis showed that
pregnancy and hypoalbuminemia (albumin level, <3.2 g/dL) at hospitalization were 
independent risk factors for subsequent development of renal scars. At follow-up,
hypertension was observed in approximately one-fifth of patients, regardless of
renal scarring status. Four women with scars had a glomerular filtration rate of 
< or =75 mL/min; none of them developed severe renal impairment. In conclusion,
the risk of developing renal scarring after AP in adult women is high. However,
clinically relevant renal damage is rare 10-20 years after AP. Tc 99m-DMSA
scanning is useful for detecting renal scars in adults but is not routinely
needed in practice.

The Escherichia coli ynfEFGHI operon encodes polypeptides which are paralogues of
dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DmsABC).

Lubitz SP(1), Weiner JH.

Author information: 
(1)CIHR Membrane Protein Research Group, Department of Biochemistry, University
of Alberta, Alta., T6G 2H7, Edmonton, Canada.

The ynfEFGHI operon is a paralogue of the Escherichia coli dmsABC operon. ynfE
and ynfF are paralogues of dmsA. ynfG and ynfH are paralogues of dmsB and dmsC,
respectively. YnfI (dmsD) has no dms paralogue. YnfE/F and YnfG could be detected
by immunoblotting with anti-DmsAB antibodies when expressed under the control of 
a tac or dms promoter. Cells harbouring ynfFGH on a multicopy plasmid supported
anaerobic growth with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as respiratory oxidant in a
dmsABC deletion, suggesting that YnfFGH forms a heterotimeric enzyme complex
similar to DmsABC. Exchange of DmsC by YnfH (DmsAB-YnfH) resulted in membrane
localization, anaerobic growth on DMSO, and binding of 2-n-heptyl
4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, indicating that YnfH was a competent anchor. YnfG can
also replace DmsB as the electron transfer subunit and assembled [Fe-S] clusters 
as judged by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. YnfE and/or YnfF could
not form a functional complex with DmsBC and expression of YnfE prevented the
accumulation of YnfFGH.

[Congenital renal abnormalities in neonates with fetal vesicoureteral reflux.
Detection by 99m-technetium(m)-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy].

BACKGROUND: "Fetal" vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is characterized by predominance 
among males, high grade reflux and renal parenchymal abnormalities, indicating an
association between sterile VUR and kidney lesions.
OBJECTIVES: To determine, using technetium99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc-DMSA) renal scan, the incidence of congenital renal abnormalities in
infants with sterile VUR detected during the postnatal evaluation of prenatal
hydronephrosis or sibling reflux screening and to speculate on the mechanisms of 
these lesions.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the DMSA renal scans of infants with VUR
without a history of urinary tract infection (UTI). DMSA differential uptake less
than or equal to 40% or cortical defects were considered as renal abnormalities. 
The findings were correlated with those of postnatal renal ultrasonography.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients (15 boys and 3 girls) were included with VUR grade V, 
IV, III and II in 5, 10, 6 and 6, respectively, of the 36 renal units. DMSA
revealed parenchymal abnormalities in 50% (9/18) of the patients and in 33%
(9/27) of the renal units with VUR; most of the patients were boys (7 boys, 2
girls) with VUR grade V or IV (6/9; 66%). Postnatal ultrasonography showed low
sensitivity (22%) to renal injury.
CONCLUSIONS: In infants with sterile VUR, especially boys with high grade VUR,
kidney abnormalities can already be present at birth suggesting a pathophysiology
of renal injury independent of UTI. Moreover, renal parenchymal defects detected 
by DMSA renal scan are frequently not identified by postnatal renal ultrasound.
Therefore, we recommend DMSA scanning in the initial evaluation of infants with
VUR.

Incidence of new renal parenchymal inflammatory changes following breakthrough
urinary tract infection in patients with vesicoureteral reflux treated with
antibiotic prophylaxis: evaluation by 99MTechnetium dimercapto-succinic acid
renal scan.

George Washington Univeristy Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010, USA.

PURPOSE: Breakthrough urinary tract infections (UTI) are considered an indication
for surgical intervention in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) with the
goal of preventing new or progressive renal scarring. We assessed the incidence
of new renal parenchymal inflammatory changes following breakthrough UTI in
patients on antibiotic prophylaxis for VUR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively analyzed 38 patients (62 refluxing renal 
units) with VUR. All patients experienced a culture documented breakthrough UTI
(greater than 100,000 cfu/ml) while taking antibiotic prophylaxis.
Dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scans were obtained 4 to 6 weeks after UTI to
detect new renal inflammatory changes and all scans were reviewed by the same
pediatric nuclear medicine specialist (MM). To avoid misinterpretation of
preexistent renal scarring for acute inflammation, new pyelonephritis was
confirmed by comparison to prior DMSA scan.
RESULTS: Of 38 patients 14 (38%) had preexistent renal scarring but only 1 (7%)
manifested new changes on DMSA scan. Of the remaining 24 patients with normal
baseline studies 3 (12.5%) had changes after UTI. Overall, only 4 patients
(10.5%) manifested new changes on DMSA scan. Three additional patients who did
not have a baseline scan for comparison demonstrated unequivocal changes of acute
pyelonephritis on DMSA scan, increasing the incidence to 17% (7 of 41). Of the
patients 7 (17%) underwent surgical correction of reflux and 34 (83%) were
maintained on antibiotic prophylaxis.
CONCLUSIONS: Of patients with VUR who experienced a single breakthrough UTI while
on antibiotic prophylaxis, at most only 17% had renal inflammatory changes on
acute DMSA scan. Our findings endorse the usefulness of DMSA scan in tailoring
management of VUR and breakthrough UTI cases, and lend support to continued
nonoperative management for the majority.

Women with diabetes mellitus (DM) have urinary tract infection (UTI) more often
than women without DM. It is unknown, however, what the prevalence and type of
renal damage due to UTI is in these women. Therefore, in this study, we compared 
type 2 DM women with or without UTI history for the prevalence and type of renal 
damage by technetium-99m dimercapto-succinic acid (Tc-99m DMSA) renal scan. A
total of 128 type 2 DM women with or without UTI history received Tc-99m DMSA
renal scan were included in this study. The patients were separated into three
groups: (1) 43 patients without UTI history, (2) 42 patients with only lower UTI 
(cystitis) history and (3) 43 patients with upper UTI (pyelonephritis) history.
The renal scan findings were separated into three types: (A) normal, (B)
inflammation and (C) scar. The 31.9% (50/128) of type 2 DM patients had renal
damages. Group 1 patients had a significantly lower prevalence of renal damages
including inflammation and scar as compared to Groups 2 and 3 patients. In
addition, the prevalence of renal damage was significantly higher in Group 3 than
in Group 2 patients. Renal scars only were visualized in Group 3 patients.
However, other clinical data were not statistically different among the three
group patients. Type 2 DM women with UTI history, especially if they had upper
UTI have a significantly higher prevalence of renal damage than in those without 
UTI.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of pentavalent (V) technetium 99m (99mTc)
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy for the assessment of disease
activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 99mTc (V) DMSA scintigraphy was performed in 76 patients. 
There were 36 patients with active IBD (11 with ulcerative colitis, 25 with Crohn
disease), 28 patients with inactive disease (eight with ulcerative colitis, 20
with Crohn disease), and 12 patients with miscellaneous bowel disease.
Sensitivity and specificity of 99mTc (V) DMSA scintigraphy in the diagnosis of
IBD were calculated. In the group with active IBD, the disease activity and
laboratory indices, as well as the endoscopic and histologic activity, were
compared with the scanning activity index. Correlation coefficients between them 
were calculated with the Spearman rank test.
RESULTS: 99mTc (V) DMSA scintigraphy had a 92% (33 of 36) sensitivity and an 86% 
(24 of 28) specificity in the detection of active IBD. A significant correlation 
between disease activity indices and scintigraphy score was demonstrated.
Endoscopic and histologic activity was significantly correlated (P =.005 and.02, 
respectively, overall disease activity) with the scanning activity score. Of the 
group of patients with miscellaneous bowel disease, three with ischemic colitis
had negative findings at scintigraphy.
CONCLUSION: 99mTc (V) DMSA scintigraphy provides a noninvasive, practical, and
accurate assessment of IBD activity.

Analysis of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in human urine by capillary
electrophoresis using direct injection.

Zhu X(1), Lever SZ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211, USA.

meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid ( meso-DMSA) is an effective chelating agent for
the treatment of lead poisoning. We have developed a capillary electrophoresis
(CE) method to monitor the urinary excretion of meso-DMSA in human beings. The
urine sample was directly injected for analysis in CE without the requirement of 
solid-phase extraction (SPE). The meso-DMSA was detected in 20 mM borate buffer
(pH 8.3) using a 60-cm length bare fused-silica capillary (75-microm ID, 52.5-cm 
effective length). The meso-DMSA can be extensively biotransformed during
metabolism, and no meso-DMSA in urine samples was found in our studies. Any
metabolized meso-DMSA can be successfully converted to free meso-DMSA by chemical
reduction with dithiothreitol (DTT). In addition, samples were also treated with 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to transchelate any meso-DMSA that is
coordinated with metal ions present in the urine samples. The total amount of
meso-DMSA present as these chemical forms was quantified after chemical reduction
and addition of EDTA. The detection limit of meso-DMSA was about 50 microM, the
RSD of peak area and migration time of meso-DMSA were 4-8% and less than 1%,
respectively.

PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare the uptake changes of Tc-99m 
2-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) and Tc-99m pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic
acid (V-DMSA) in multiple myeloma (MM) lesions in response to high-dose
chemotherapy (HDC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors compared Tc-99m MIBI and Tc-99m V-DMSA scans
before and after HDC in a patient with focal MM lesions without amyloidosis who
had received previous standard chemotherapy as well.
RESULTS: HDC had the effect of eliminating all Tc-99m MIBI uptake in the lesions.
Tc-99m V-DMSA uptake was increased in lesions presenting significant initial
Tc-99m MIBI uptake. In 1 particular lesion that demonstrated this phenomenon,
magnetic resonance showed necrosis of the area of MM.
CONCLUSION: The authors consider that the effect of increasing Tc-99m V-DMSA
uptake in the absence of an increase in viable plasma cells possibly reflects the
treatment-generated inflammatory and fibrotic changes and not necessarily viable 
tumor tissue. Exclusive focal Tc-99m V-DMSA uptake in this clinical setting could
be considered as a sign of effectively treated lesions and not a sign of
deterioration.

infection.

The prevalence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in children with urinary tract
infection (UTI) varies among different racial groups. The purpose of this study
was to determine the frequency of VUR and associated renal changes in a group of 
Arab Kuwaiti children with their first documented febrile UTI and to compare our 
findings with those reported from other racial groups. One hundred and
seventy-four children (38 males and 136 females) fulfilled the study criteria and
were divided into three age groups (<1 year, 1-5 years, and >5 years). Patients
in each group had both micturating cystourethrography (MCUG) and
99m-Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan after diagnosis. VUR was
detected in 39 children (22%). Two-thirds of cases had mild reflux (grade I and
II). Females ( n=32) had more reflux than males ( n=7) (24% vs. 18%). Sixty-three
patients (36%) had abnormal (DMSA) renal scans (acute pyelonephritis [AP] or
renal scars). Of these, 79% were children below 5 years. Abnormal DMSA scans were
found in 4 of 38 males (11%) versus 59 of 136 females (43%). Abnormal scans in
children with VUR were seen in 1 of 7 males (14%) versus 19 of 32 females (59%). 
In total, the combination of abnormal scan with VUR occurred in 1 of 38 males
(3%) and in 19 of 136 females (14%), whereas abnormal scan without demonstrable
VUR was seen in 3 of 38 males (8%) versus 40 of 136 females (29%). Our data
showed that the frequency of VUR in Arab Kuwaiti children with febrile UTI is
midway between Caucasian and other racial groups. In this study, males had a
lower-risk profile than females, the latter having a higher rate of reflux as
well as a higher rate of abnormal DMSA scans, irrespective of demonstrable VUR.

AIMS: To compare associations of lead biomarkers with renal function in current
and former lead workers.
METHODS: Cross sectional analysis of first year results from a longitudinal study
of 803 lead workers and 135 controls in South Korea. Clinical renal function was 
assessed by blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and measured and
calculated creatinine clearance. Urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG)
and retinol-binding protein were also measured.
RESULTS: Mean (SD) tibia lead, blood lead, and DMSA chelatable lead levels in
lead workers were 37.2 (40.4) micro g/g bone mineral, 32.0 (15.0) micro g/dl, and
767.8 (862.1) micro g/g creatinine, respectively. Higher lead measures were
associated with worse renal function in 16/42 models. When influential outliers
were removed, higher lead measures remained associated with worse renal function 
in nine models. An additional five associations were in the opposite direction.
Effect modification by age was observed. In 3/16 models, associations between
higher lead measures and worse clinical renal function in participants in the
oldest age tertile were significantly different from associations in those in the
youngest age tertile which were in the opposite direction. Mean urinary cadmium
(CdU) was 1.1 micro g/g creatinine (n = 191). Higher CdU levels were associated
with higher NAG.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that lead has an adverse effect on renal function
in the moderate dose range, particularly in older workers. Associations between
higher lead measures and lower BUN and serum creatinine and higher creatinine
clearances may represent lead induced hyperfiltration. Environmental cadmium may 
also have an adverse renal impact, at least on NAG.

INTRODUCTION: Most authors would agree that renal parenchymal defects (scars,
hypoplasia, dysplasia) in children are a major risk factor for chronic renal
failure, and for development of systemic hypertension in later years. The
pathophysiologic changes in acute pyelonephritis include tubulointerstitial
inflammation/pus with impairment of the renal microcirculation due to compression
of the glomeruli, small peritubular capillaries and vasa recta by interstitial
edema. The resulting ischemia has been postulated as one of the mechanisms for
the decreased accumulation of DMSA in the areas of pyelonephritis. DMSA scanning 
has a sensitivity of up to 99%, and specificity of up to 91% for the detection of
acute pyelonephritis.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to investigate the value of Tc99m-DMSA
scan in children with acute urinary tract infection, to estimate the degree of
parenchymal changes, and to assess the relationship with vesicoureteral reflux.
PATIENTS: We reviewed 116 infants aged 0-15 years, 100 (86.2%) female and 16
(13.8%) male, who were hospitalized for urinary tract infection during a 5-year
period (1996-2000). The mean age at diagnosis was 3.7 years.
RESULTS: Escherichia colli was isolated in 52 (44.8%) urine cultures. All
patients underwent ultrasonography, which was normal in 57 (49.1%) infants.
Tc99m-DMSA was performed after two weeks of therapy. The renal parenchymal
pathology was defined as a focal or multifocal defect of low degree in 33
(28.4%), and of high degree in 35 (30%) children. Multifocal defects were mostly 
found in patients aged < 3 years, and focal lesions in those aged > 3 years.
Renal scars were detected in 41 (35.3%) infants with first urinary tract
infection.
CONCLUSION: We recommend that ultrasound, DMSA and radionuclide cystouretherogram
be routinely performed in case of first urinary tract infection in infants aged <
1 year, and voiding cystourethrogram with US and DMSA in those aged > 1 year.

Vitamin C, glutathione, or lipoic acid did not decrease brain or kidney mercury
in rats exposed to mercury vapor.

Some medical practitioners prescribe GSH and vitamin C alone or in combination
with DMPS or DMSA for patients with mercury exposure that is primarily due to the
mercury vapor emitted by dental amalgams.HYPOTHESIS: This study tested the
hypothesis that GSH, vitamin C, or lipoic acid alone or in combination with DMPS 
or DMSA would decrease brain mercury.
METHODS: Young rats were exposed to elemental mercury by individual nose cone, at
the rate of 4.0 mg mercury per m3 air for 2 h per day for 7 consecutive days.
After a 7-day equilibrium period, DMPS, DMSA, GSH, vitamin C, lipoic acid alone, 
or in combination was administered for 7 days and the brain and kidneys of the
animals removed and analyzed for mercury by cold vapor atomic absorption.
RESULTS: None of these regimens reduced the mercury content of the brain.
Although DMPS or DMSA was effective in reducing kidney mercury concentrations,
GSH, vitamin C, lipoic acid alone, or in combination were not.
CONCLUSION: One must conclude that the palliative effect, if any, of GSH, vitamin
C, or lipoic acid for treatment of mercury toxicity due to mercury vapor exposure
does not involve mercury mobilization from the brain and kidney.

The authors studied children in Andean villages contaminated by a lead-glazing
cottage industry. Mean blood lead (PbB) level in 35 exposed children, aged 3-14
years, a year before treatment, at the time of initiation of a comprehensive lead
education and prevention program, was 53.4 microg/dL. PbB levels immediately
before and three weeks after a ten-day regimen of succimer treatment of the 35
children were 43.4 microg/dL and 34.3 microg/dL, respectively, showing a 21%
reduction and a significant difference between means (t = 5.09, p = 0.0001). PbB 
levels of the same children a year before treatment and immediately pre-treatment
were also significantly different (t = 10.59, p = 0.0001). Thus, a ten-day course
of succimer chelation effectively reduced PbB in children with moderate to severe
Pb intoxication, and the education and prevention program, initiated with
parents, health care providers, and educators, also contributed significantly to 
reducing PbB.

Technetium-99m-N,N-ethylenedicysteine and Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy in the
evaluation of renal parenchymal abnormalities in children.

Turkey. mkibar@mail.cu.edu.tr

Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99m DMSA) as a static renal agent is
currently the most frequently used agent in the detection of renal scarring, and 
allows accurate calculation of differential renal function (DRF). But this agent 
has some disadvantages such as relatively higher radiation dose and time
consumption.METHODS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of
summed image that obtained from parenchymal phase of the dynamic
technetium-99m-N,N-ethylenedicysteine (Tc-99m EC) scintigraphy in the detection
of renal parenchymal defects and in the estimation of DRF, and to compare the
results of this method with those of Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy. The uptake ratios 
of the kidney to body background were also calculated for these two methods.
Twenty-nine children with various renal disorders underwent both static Tc-99m
DMSA and dynamic Tc-99m EC scintigraphy. The cortical analysis of Tc-99m EC
scintigraphy was performed on the summed image obtained from dynamic images using
the time interval between the first 45-120 sec.
RESULTS: There was a very close correlation between these two methods with
respect to DRF (r = 0.99). In the detection of renal parenchymal lesions,
scintigraphy with Tc-99m DMSA detected more lesions, and the sensitivity and
specificity of the summed Tc-99m EC images were calculated as 92.6% and 100%,
respectively. In addition, the ratios of mean uptake values for Tc-99m DMSA and
Tc-99m EC images were 7.59 +/- 2.17 and 2.95 +/- 0.91, respectively. This ratio
of Tc-99m EC seems to be acceptable and allows good delineation of the kidneys.
But, the main disadvantages of the summed Tc-99m EC images in comparison with
static Tc-99m DMSA images are the use of only posterior projection that may be an
important drawback in patients with abnormal kidney positions, lower image counts
and higher pixel size because of dynamic acquisition.
CONCLUSION: These results show that summed Tc-99m EC images with an acceptable
high image contrast provide an accurate DRF calculation in patients without
abnormal kidney positions and allow the detection of most renal parenchymal
abnormalities. However, Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy remains the gold standard method
because of its well known advantages.

[Diagnostic value of pentavalent 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinicacid ([V]-DMSA) in head 
and neck tumors].

The purpose of this investigation was to assess the biodistribution of
99mTc-[V]-DMSA in human being, and its diagnostic value in patients with head and
neck tumours. 20 patients with histologically confirmed head and neck tumours
were examined with planar as well as SPECT scintigraphy. Whole body scintigraphy 
in different time after injection of 99mTc-[V]-DMSA was performed to assess the
major sequential organ biodistribution. Our results showed that the blood
clearance of 99mTc-[V]-DMSA was bi-exponential. All organs except kidneys showed 
a relatively rapid elimination of 99mTc-[V]-DMSA. The kidneys showed a increasing
accumulation in the first 2 h, which is probably due to the tubular reabsorption 
of 99mTc-[V]-DMSA. In 15 of 20 patients, 19 lesions could be proven by means of
planar scintigraphy (corresponding sensitivity of 75%). 29 lesions in 18 patients
could however be detected by the application of SPECT (corresponding sensitivity 
of 90%). Except primary tumours and local lymphadenmetastases in 5 patients
distant metastases (3 thorax wall, 1 liver and 1 inguinal/paravesicle) were
found. Altogether a sensitivity of 76.9% and a specificity of 71.4% were
calculated for the detection of primary tumour. The sensitivity and specificity
for the exploration of lymphadenmetastases were 75% and 100%. In conclusion, this
study show that 99m Tc-[V]-DMSA, particularly with SPECT imaging, is useful in
localising the primary tumours and lymphadenmetastases as well as distant
metastases of head and neck tumours. The possible therapeutic application of
188/186Re-[V]-DMSA is also evaluated.

Effects of calcium disodium EDTA and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid on tissue
concentrations of lead for use in treatment of calves with experimentally induced
lead toxicosis.

Meldrum JB(1), Ko KW.

Medicine, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of calcium disodium EDTA (CaNa2EDTA) and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in reducing concentrations of lead in
selected tissues for use in treatment of calves with experimentally induced lead 
toxicosis.
ANIMALS: 19 sexually intact male Holstein calves that weighed 35 to 60 kg.
PROCEDURE: Calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment groups: group 1,
control calves; group 2, lead only; group 3, lead and EDTA; group 4, lead and
DMSA; and group 5, lead, EDTA, and DMSA. Calves in groups 2 to 5 were dosed daily
with lead (5 mg/kg, PO) for 10 days. Doses of EDTA (100 mg/kg) and DMSA (25
mg/kg) were administered IV once daily for 4 consecutive days beginning on day
11. Effects of the chelators on lead concentrations in the liver, kidneys,
testes, muscles, bones, and brain were compared among the various groups.
RESULTS: Compared with the effects of EDTA, DMSA greatly reduced lead
concentrations in renal and hepatic tissues. We did not detect significant
differences for the effects of EDTA or DMSA on lead concentrations in the testes;
there was an adverse interaction of EDTA with DMSA that caused an increase in
lead concentrations in the testes.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: DMSA is much more effective than EDTA in
removing lead from renal and hepatic tissues in calves. Use of DMSA in calves
with lead intoxication appears to be a viable treatment option. Combining DMSA
and EDTA as a treatment modality in calves did not offer any advantages.

Metals are amongst the oldest toxic substances known to man. In today's
industrialized world the sources of exposure to metals are ubiquitous both in the
field of work and from polluted water, foodstuffs and the environment. Their
toxicity is characterized by the metallic element in question, but this is
modified by the type of compound, whether organic or inorganic, and its
characteristics of hydrosolubility and liposolubility, which determines its
toxicokinetics and thus the possibilities of it reaching its targets. The
biomolecules most affected by metals are the proteins with enzymatic activity,
which is why their pathology is multisystemic. The principal systems affected are
the gastrointestinal, central and peripheral neurological, haematic and renal.
Some metallic compounds are carcinogenic. Metals's treatment is conditioned by
their chemical reactivity. They can be deactivated and eliminated by the
administering of chelating agents that produce complex molecules, which are
non-toxic and can be excreted. The principal chelating agents are: BAL (British
Anti-Lewisite or dimercaprol) DMPS (2,3-Dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic Acid) and
DMSA (meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic or Succimer), EDTA, Penicilamine
(b,b-dimethylcysteine) and Deferoxamine. Toxicokinetic characteristics, mechanism
of action, clinical picture and treatment of some of the most relevant metals and
metalloids: lead, mercury and arsenic, are considered.

Utility of posterior oblique views in (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy in
children.

Brussels, Belgium.

OBJECTIVE: Procedure guidelines suggest that optimal (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) planar scintigraphy of the kidney should include right and left
posterior oblique views in addition to the posterior projection. However, in a
small number of restless children, it is sometimes difficult to get 3
good-quality images. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of
cases in which posterior oblique views were useful for interpreting (99m)Tc-DMSA 
renal scintigraphy.
METHODS: Three nuclear medicine specialists were asked to interpret 40
(99m)Tc-DMSA renal scans twice, first on the basis of the posterior projection
only and then by using the posterior and the right and left posterior oblique
views.
RESULTS: The oblique posterior views were considered useful by observers 1 and 2 
for 4 kidneys and by observer 3 for 5 kidneys and were considered somewhat useful
for up to 7 kidneys. The addition of oblique posterior views changed the
interpretation on 5 occasions for observer 1, on 9 occasions for the observer 3, 
and on no occasion for observer 2. On average, therefore, changes in
interpretation occurred for fewer than 6% of the kidneys. Moreover, no
relationship was observed between the opinion of the clinicians that oblique
views were useful and changes in the scintigraphic interpretations.
CONCLUSION: Oblique views were found useful in only a few cases and, even in
these cases, did not significantly modify the interpretations. Therefore, when
restless children are being imaged, the focus should be on obtaining a good
posterior projection, even at the price of not having oblique posterior views.

The role of gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for children with
suspected acute pyelonephritis.

Weiser AC(1), Amukele SA, Leonidas JC, Palmer LS.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Pediatric Urology, Schneider Children's Hospital/Long Island
Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, New York, USA.

PURPOSE: The diagnosis of pyelonephritis is primarily clinical. However, the
history and physical findings can be confusing in children, leading to adjunctive
nuclear renal cortical scintigraphic studies (99mtechnetium dimercapto-succinic
acid [DMSA]) to confirm the diagnosis. Nonetheless, ambiguity occurs when
differentiating between acute pyelonephritis and chronic scarring. We report our 
initial experience with gadolinium enhanced inversion recovery magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) to diagnose acute pyelonephritis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients 7 months to 18 years old (mean age 81
months) underwent MRI to confirm radiographically a clinical suspicion of acute
pyelonephritis. All patients had at least 1 prior episode of clinical
pyelonephritis. Data were collected to determine whether acute pyelonephritic
changes could be differentiated from chronic pyelonephritis on the basis of MRI
characteristics.
RESULTS: Of the 9 patients 4 were identified as having acute pyelonephritis on
MRI (persistently high signal intensity after gadolinium), 2 demonstrated
evidence of postpyelonephritic scar (parenchymal loss without change in signal
intensity), 1 had evidence of acute pyelonephritis and chronic changes, and 2 had
a completely normal examination (decreased signal intensity after gadolinium). At
our institution the billable cost of MRI to the patient is $1,329, while the
billable cost of 99mtechnetium DMSA is $1,459. All patients younger than 6 years 
required intravenous sedation for MRI, whereas 70% of those younger than 6 years 
require intravenous sedation for DMSA scanning at our institution. MRI provided
greater anatomical detail regarding the renal architecture without radiation
exposure, and allowed the unambiguous diagnosis of acute versus chronic
pyelonephritis scar in a 1-time (versus often multipart for DMSA) imaging study.
CONCLUSIONS: In cases where adjunctive imaging studies are useful to make a
diagnosis gadolinium enhanced inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging
allows the detection of acute pyelonephritis rapidly, cost-effectively and safely
in the pediatric population.

Are there teratogenic risks associated with antidotes used in the acute
management of poisoned pregnant women?

Bailey B(1).

Author information: 
(1)Division of Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Hôpital Ste-Justine,
Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada. baileyb@med.umontreal.ca

OBJECTIVE: We reviewed evidence suggesting teratogenic risk associated with the
use of antidotes in the acute management of poisoned pregnant women.
METHODS: Medline, Toxline, and DART/ETIC searches; references of retrieved
articles, pertinent databases and textbooks were also searched.
RESULTS: There are case reports or case series of women who received antidotes
for poisoning during (*) or after (+) the period of organogenesis who showed no
fetal adverse effects. Some antidotes, however, have no teratogenic risk:
atropine (cohort/surveillance studies)+, calcium (oral supplement: cohort study)+
and pyridoxine (Bendectin studies). Also, ethanol+, methylene blue
(intra-amniotic injection but not oral) and penicillamine* can be considered
teratogens but their risks in the treatment of poisonings are unknown. There is
no epidemiologic study evaluating the risk of the following antidotes during
pregnancy: N-acetylcysteine(*+), BAL (dimercaprol)+, black widow spider
antivenin+, calcium EDTA+, crotalidae antivenin, crotalidae polyvalent immune
FAB, cyanide antidote kit (amyl and sodium nitrate, sodium thiosulfate),
deferoxamine(*+), digoxin immune FAB+, DMSA+, flumazenil+, fomepizole, methylene 
blue (IV), naloxone, physostigmine, pralidoxime+, protamine+; and parenteral
pharmacologic doses of calcium+, folinic acid*, glucagon+, hydroxycobalamin,
phytonadione (vitamin K), and pyridoxine.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited evidence supporting the risk of antidote use
during pregnancy, antidotes should be used when there is a clear maternal
indication to decrease the morbidity or mortality associated with poisoning. The 
only exception may be penicillamine, which is a teratogen. Better antidotes exist
for most poisonings that penicillamine could potentially treat. At this time,
there is no known fetal indication for all antidotes. Reporting the use of an
antidote during pregnancy should be encouraged, especially if used during the
critical period of organogenesis.

Sectorial technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy for monitoring the 
effect of extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy for calyceal calculi on
regional renal function.

University, Safat, Kuwait.

OBJECTIVE: To apply a semiquantitative method for analysis of
technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy for
monitoring the effect of extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy (EPL) in
patients with calyceal stones on regional kidney function and to check whether
EPL had caused any deleterious effect on the target calyceal renal parenchymal
function.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients (mean age 35 years) suffering from calyceal 
stones documented by abdominal plain radiography, intravenous urogram or
abdominal ultrasound were studied. All patients were treated by EPL. (99m)Tc-DMSA
scan was performed before and 4 weeks after EPL. Sector analysis involved
calculation of the relative function of the target calyx to the function of the
ipsilateral kidney and the relative function of the treated kidney to global
renal function.
RESULTS: The stone sizes were 6-11 mm in diameter and 11 were located in the
upper, 13 in the middle and 16 in the lower calyx. After EPL, the overall stone
clearance rate was 85% (100% for calculi in the upper and middle calyces, 62% for
lower calyces). The sector analysis did not show statistically significant change
of the relative regional (calyceal) or whole kidney function between the pre- and
post-EPL (99m)Tc-DMSA scans. Using sector analysis, EPL appeared to be a safe
modality and its usage was not associated with any untoward effect on calyceal or
whole kidney function.
CONCLUSION: Sector analysis of (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scan is a simple
semiquantitative method for monitoring regional changes of kidney function after 
EPL for treatment of calyceal stone.

[Urinary tract infections and vesicoureteral reflux as a cause of renal
parenchymal damage].

[Article in Croatian]

Hercegovina.

GOAL: Infection of the urinary tract is a risk for the damage of parenchyma and
kidney function. Dimercaptosuccinil acid (DMSA) scan was used based on the
relation between vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), infection of the urinary tract
(UTI) and parenchymal kidney damage.
METHODOLOGY: The number of observed children was 79, 58 (73.41%) girls and 21
(26.58%) boys: following the first UTIs, recidiv infect and with positive VUR
contrast voiding cistourethrography (VCUG) and ultrasound tests were compelted
following the treatment of infect within 6 weeks and DMSA within 4 months. The
classification of VUR was done of I to V degrees. The damage to the renal
parenchyma after DMSA was defined as inhomogen distribution, reduced bonding with
radio-farmake as well as portion of the kidney in the overall renal function
smaller than 45%.
RESULTS: Among 45.56% (36/79) patients VUR was registered. Reflux over III/V was 
registered among 27.84 (22/79) among whom 24.05% (19/79) were younger than 5
years of age. DMSA scan showed reduced kidney function bellow 45%, in one
direction 33.33% (12/36) and 25.00% (9/36) in both directions. The correlation
between clinically proved acute pielonephrities and damage to the parenchyma was 
not proven. It was proven in 30.37% (24/79) reoccurring urinal infection.
CONCLUSION: DMSA is a sensitive method that should not be routinely used on every
child with urinary infection. It should be left to assess the renal damage in
cases of high degree reflux and reoccurring urinary infection.

Pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid [99mTc(V)-DMSA] scintigraphy
was evaluated for the differentiation of pituitary adenomas, especially
non-functioning adenomas, from other sellar and parasellar lesions. Diffuse
99mTc(V)-DMSA accumulation within the tumor was found in seven of seven
non-functioning, three of four growth hormone-secreting, and seven of eight
prolactin-secreting adenomas, but only partial accumulation in only two of 16
non-pituitary adenomas and normal pituitary glands. There were no significant
relationship between tumor-to-background ratios and tumor size or serum hormone
level. 99mTc(V)-DMSA scintigraphy showed overall sensitivity of 81% (17/21 cases)
for detecting pituitary adenomas, in particular 100% for non-functioning
adenomas. 99mTc(V)-DMSA may be useful for detecting pituitary adenomas,
especially non-functioning adenomas, and for the differentiation of
non-functioning pituitary adenomas from other sellar and parasellar lesions.

Combined efficacies of lipoic acid and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid on
lead-induced erythrocyte membrane lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in
rats.

Basic Medical Sciences, University of Madras, Taramani, Chennai-600 113, India.

One of the most intriguing phenomenon observed during lead toxicity has been
attributed to lead-induced oxidative stress. The combined effect of
DL-alpha-lipoic acid (LA) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on
lead-induced alterations in selected parameters, which are indicators of
oxidative stress in erythrocytes, have been studied. Lead acetate (Pb, 0.2%) was 
administered in drinking water for 5 weeks to induce toxicity. LA (25 mg/ kg body
weight per day i.p.) and DMSA (20 mg/kg body weight per day i.p.) were
administered individually and also in combination during week 6. Clinical
evidence of toxic exposure was evident from the elevated blood lead levels (BPb) 
along with lowered levels of haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (Ht). Lead-exposed 
animals showed enhanced membrane lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the erythrocytes.
Damage to the erythrocyte membrane was evident from the decline in the activities
of the transmembrane enzymes, viz., Na+, K(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-ATPase and
Mg(2+)-ATPase. Lead-exposed rats also suffered an onslaught on the antioxidant
defence system witnessed by lowered activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide
dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and reduced glutathione (GSH).
Serum glutamic-oxoloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic-pyruvic
transaminase (SGPT) were also elevated in lead-exposed rats. Treatment with
either LA or DMSA reversed the lead-induced biochemical disturbances encountered 
by the erythrocytes, but combined treatment with LA and DMSA was very effective
in mitigating all the parameters indicative of oxidative stress.

BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common diseases in
children. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been demonstrated in a substantial
number of young children with UTI. Empiric antibacterial therapy is recommended
before results of the urine culture are available in order to shorten the
duration of the disease and prevent renal complications.
OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence and
susceptibility patterns of UTI pathogens, and urinary anomalies in children
admitted with UTI.
METHODS: The study population included 151 children younger than 14 years
admitted with first UTI. Renal ultrasound was performed in all the patients and
voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in children younger than 5 years.
Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was performed in children with vesicoureteral
reflux. The data included age, sex, symptoms and signs, urinalysis, the pathogen 
and its sensitivity and the results of the imaging studies.
RESULTS: A total of 119 patients (79%) were females. Gram negative rods caused
98% of the infections, of which Escherichia coli (87%) was the most prevalent
pathogen, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4%), and Proteus mirabilis (4%). The
sensitivities to antibacterial agents were: Amikacin 100%, ceftazidime 97%,
gentamicin 96%, ceftriaxone 96%, cefuroxime 95%, amoxicillin-clavulanate 84%,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 63%, cephalexin 58%, and ampicillin 28%. Renal US
showed minor abnormalities in 24/149 (16%) and VCUG demonstrated vesicoureteral
reflux in 38/127 (30%) patients. DMSA revealed renal scars in 7/28 (25%) children
with vesicoureteral reflux.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall Gram negative rods cause 98% of the UTI in hospitalized
children in our area. E. coli is the leading pathogen and aminoglycosides and
second or third generation cephalosporins are the most suitable agents for
empiric therapy in UTI. A high incidence of renal scars in young children with
vesicoureteral reflux was found.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was shown to lower blood pressure in rat models of
arterial hypertension. Thus, there is evidence that-besides its chelating
properties-DMSA has a direct vascular effect, e.g. through scavenging of reactive
oxygen species (ROS). We speculated that, in addition, intracellular calcium
mobilization may be involved in this action. Therefore, the present study
examined the effects of DMSA on Ca(2+) mobilization in cultured vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMCs) from rat aorta. Intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration
([Ca(2+)](i)) was measured with fura-2 AM. In a first series of experiments DMSA,
10(-11) to 10(-6)M, induced an immediate dose-dependent up to 4-fold rise of
[Ca(2+)](i) (P<0.001) which was almost completely blunted by the calcium channel 
blocker verapamil or the intracellular calcium release blocker TMB-8. In a second
series of experiments, when VSMCs were exposed acutely to DMSA (10(-11) to
10(-6)M), the angiotensin (ANG) II (10(-8)M)-induced rise in [Ca(2+)](i) to
295+/-40nM was attenuated at the average by 49% independent of the dose of DMSA. 
Preincubation of VSMCs with DMSA (10(-6)M) for 60min reduced basal [Ca(2+)](i) by
77% (P<0.001) and dose-dependently attenuated the ANG II (10(-8)M)-induced rise
in [Ca(2+)](i) between 28 and 69% at concentrations between 10(-9) and 10(-5)M
DMSA, respectively (P<0.05 and <0.01). In the presence of TMB-8, which attenuated
the ANG II (10(-8)M)-induced rise in [Ca(2+)](i) by 66%, DMSA (10(-6)M) had no
additional suppressive effect on [Ca(2+)](i). The results suggest that DMSA
acutely raises [Ca(2+)](i) by stimulating transmembrane calcium influx via L-type
calcium channels and by calcium release from intracellular stores followed by a
decrease in [Ca(2+)](i) probably due to cellular calcium depletion. Thus, in
addition to its action as scavenger of ROS, which in part mediate the
vasoconstrictor response, e.g. to ANG II, DMSA may exert its hypotensive effect
through decreasing total cell calcium, thereby attenuating the
vasoconstrictor-induced rise in [Ca(2+)](i) in VSMCs.

INTRODUCTION: Despite being banned as a pesticide, thallium still results in
human and animal poisonings. Current recommended treatments include the use of
the chemical Prussian Blue. Limitations in its availability may result in
Prussian Blue not being obtainable in the thallium-poisoned patient. The chelator
2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is currently FDA-approved for use in childhood
lead poisoning and has been reported to be beneficial in treating other heavy
metal poisonings. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of
DMSA as a treatment for thallium poisoning by studying mortality and whole-brain 
concentrations in thallium poisoned rats.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Rats were gavaged with 30 mg/kg of thallium. After 24 hours
they were randomized to DMSA (n = 20) 50 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days, Prussian
Blue (n = 20) 50 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days, or control (n = 30). Animals were 
monitored twice daily for weight loss and mortality. Animals losing greater than 
20% of their starting weight were euthanized and counted as a mortality. All
surviving rats at 120 hours had their brains harvested and digested and underwent
subsequent thallium analysis.
RESULTS: The rate of survival in DMSA-treated animals compared to control was 45%
vs. 21%, p = 0.07. Mean whole-brain thallium concentrations between DMSA and
control rats were 3.4 vs. 3.0 microg/g, p = 0.06. Prussian Blue-treated rats had 
significantly improved survival (70% vs. 21%, p < 0.01) and lower whole-brain
thallium concentrations (1.6 vs. 3.0 microg/g, p < 0.01 tissue) compared to
controls.
CONCLUSION: DMSA failed to reduce brain thallium concentrations in rats poisoned 
with thallium and had an indeterminate effect on mortality while Prussian Blue
significantly reduces both brain thallium concentrations and mortality.

Beneficial effect of combined administration of some naturally occurring
antioxidants (vitamins) and thiol chelators in the treatment of chronic lead
intoxication.

Ameliorative effects of few naturally occurring antioxidants like ascorbic acid
(vitamin C), alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) either alone or in combination with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA), on
parameters indicative of oxidative stress in the liver, kidney, brain and blood
of lead-exposed rats were studied. Male Wistar rats were exposed to 0.1% lead
acetate in drinking water for 3 months and treated thereafter with DMSA or its
analogue MiADMSA (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), either individually or in
combination with vitamin E (5 mg/kg, intramuscularly) or vitamin C (25 mg/kg,
orally) once daily for 5 days. The effects of these treatments in influencing the
lead-induced alterations in haem synthesis pathway, hepatic, renal and brain
oxidative stress and lead concentration from the soft tissues were investigated. 
Exposure to lead produced a significant inhibition of delta-aminolevulinic acid
dehydratase (ALAD) activity from 8.44+/-0.26 in control animals to 1.76+/-0.32 in
lead control, reduction in glutathione (GSH) from 3.56+/-0.14 to 2.57+/-0.25 and 
an increase in zinc protoporphyrin level from 62.0+/-3.9 to 170+/-10.7 in blood, 
suggesting altered haem synthesis pathway. Both the thiol chelators and the two
vitamins were able to increase blood ALAD activity towards normal, however, GSH
level responded favorably only to the two thiol chelators. The most prominent
effect on blood ALAD activity was, however, observed when MiADMSA was
co-administered with vitamin C (7.51+/-0.17). Lead exposure produced a
significant depletion of hepatic GSH from 4.59+/-0.78 in control animals to
2.27+/-0.47 in lead controls and catalase activity from 100+/-3.4 to 22.1+/-0.25,
while oxidized glutathione (GSSG; 0.34+/-0.05 to 2.05+/-0.25), thiobarbituric
acid reactive substance (TBARS; 1.70+/-0.45 to 5.22+/-0.50) and glutathione
peroxidase (GPx) levels (3.41+/-0.09 to 6.17+/-0.65) increased significantly,
pointing to hepatic oxidative stress. Altered, reduced and oxidized GSH levels
showed significant recovery after MiADMSA and DMSA administration while, vitamins
E and C were effective in reducing GSSG and TBARS levels and increasing catalase 
activity. Administration of MiADMSA alone and the combined administration of
vitamin C along with DMSA and MiADMSA were most effective in increasing hepatic
GSH levels to 4.88+/-0.14, 4.09+/-0.12 and 4.30+/-0.06, respectively. Hepatic
catalase also reached near normal level in animals co-administered vitamin C with
DMSA or MiADMSA (82.5+/-4.5 and 84.2+/-3.5, respectively). Combined treatments
with vitamins and the thiol chelators were also able to effectively reduce
lead-induced decrease in renal catalase activity and increase in TBARS and GPx
level. Combination therapy, however, was unable to provide an effective reversal 
in the altered parameters indicative of oxidative stress in different brain
regions, except in catalase activity. The result also suggests a beneficial role 
of vitamin E when administered along with the thiol chelators (particularly with 
MiADMSA) in reducing body lead burden. Blood lead concentration was reduced from 
13.3+/-0.11 in lead control to 0.3+/-0.01 in MiADMSA plus vitamin E-treated rats.
Liver and kidney lead concentration also showed a most prominent decrease in
MiADMSA plus vitamin E co-administered rats (5.29+/-0.16 to 0.63+/-0.02 and
14.1+/-0.21 to 1.51+/-0.13 in liver and kidney, respectively). These results thus
suggest that vitamin C administration during chelation with DMSA/MiADMSA was
significantly beneficial in reducing oxidative stress however, it had little or
no additive effect on the depletion of lead compared with the effect of chelators
alone. Thus, the co-administration of vitamin E during chelation treatment with
DMSA or MiADMSA could be recommended for achieving optimum effects of chelation
therapy.

The efficacy of meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) (succimer) in treating avian 
lead intoxication was studied in a retrospective, nonrandomized, longitudinal
study. Nineteen birds with moderate to high blood lead concentration and
neurologic signs compatible with lead toxicity were treated with DMSA (30 mg/kg
p.o., b.i.d.; n = 15) for a minimum of 7 days. In cases with severe neurologic
signs, DMSA was supplemented with a single dose of edetate calcium disodium
(<50.0 mg/kg of body weight i.m.; n = 4). Blood lead concentrations were measured
two or more times (before and after treatment). Median blood lead concentration
decreased (87%), neurologic signs were resolved, and there were no apparent
adverse secondary effects.

A prospective study was conducted to determine the possibility of obstructive
hydronephrosis in horseshoe kidney found incidentally in school children and
adolescents by using a radionuclide diuretic renogram. In a 2-year period, 22
school children and adolescents with horseshoe kidney were found in a mass renal 
sonography survey. They each underwent a 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid renal
cortical scan to confirm the horseshoe kidney. Each diuretic renogram was
performed with the patient in the supine position to rule out obstructive
hydronephrosis. The patients were advised to empty their bladders before the
intravenous injection of furosemide (1 mg x kg(-1)). The half-time for the
clearance of radioactivity from the renal pelvis were calculated. Of the 22
patients, asymmetrical renal cortical function between the two kidneys was found 
in 14 (63.6%). Eleven kidneys (11/44, 25%) showed stasis of radioactive urine in 
the renal pelvic region prior to injection of furosemide. There was no incidence 
of bilateral hydronephrosis in these 22 patients. Only one kidney (1/44, 2.3%)
showed obstructive hydronephrosis and five showed clearance of radioactive urine 
stasis from the renal pelvis immediately after standing up for voiding. There is 
a low percentage of obstructive hydronephrosis in these cases of horseshoe kidney
found incidentally in children and adolescents. A follow-up cohort study on these
patients would be valuable for monitoring the development of complications.

Early identification of different categories of the risk of scarring in children 
with first (or follow up) urinary tract infection and/or early detection and
treatment of vesicoureteral reflux are important to prevent kidney impairment.
The demonstration and grading of reflux is crucial in examination and follow up
of any child with urinary tract infection. Nephro-urologic radionuclide studies
are able to detect vesicoureteral reflux and reflux nephropathy, such as
radionuclide cystography--RNC--(both direct radionuclide voiding
cystography--DRVC--and indirect radionuclide cystography-IRC), renal DMSA
scintigraphy, MAG3 renal diuresis scintigraphy and DTPA renal diuresis
scintigraphy. They allow to assess renal parenchyma integrity, to detect
pyelonephritic scars, to evaluate the different aspects of urinary tract function
and to measure absolute and relative function after intravenous injection of
radiopharmaceuticals. The procedure, image acquisition and processing and the
diagnostic relevance of all aforesaid nephro-urologic radionuclide studies are
illustrated.

Quantitative renal scintigraphy in domestic pigeons (Columba livia domestica)
exposed to toxic doses of gentamicin.

Marshall KL(1), Craig LE, Jones MP, Daniel GB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Comparative Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University
of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996-4543, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To standardize techniques for renal scintigraphy in birds, to use
scintigraphy to assess gentamicin nephrotoxicosis in birds, to compare nuclear
medicine assessments with histologic assessment of gentamicin nephrotoxicosis and
serum uric acid concentrations, and to determine the radiopharmaceutical that
best quantifies avian renal function.
ANIMALS: 12 domestic pigeons (Columba livia domestica).
PROCEDURE: Serum uric acid concentrations were determined for all birds. Renal
scintigraphy techniques that used technetium-m99 (99mTc)-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA; 4 hours after injection) and 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid
(DTPA; 15-minute dynamic study) were evaluated in all birds. Renal biopsy
specimens were collected following baseline scans. Number and size of renal
tubule granules positive for periodic acid-Schiff stain were scored for severity 
(scale of 0 to 4). Nephrotoxicosis was induced by administration of gentamicin.
Serum uric acid concentrations were measured, and 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-DTPA scans
were repeated after gentamicin administration. Birds were euthanatized, and
complete necropsies were performed.
RESULTS: Standard avian renal scintigraphy techniques were developed for
99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-DTPA. Decreased renal radiopharmaceutical uptake for
99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-DTPA indicated nephrotoxicosis. Cloacal accumulation of
99mTc-DTPA was significantly decreased after administration of gentamicin.
Histologic grading of renal tissue before and after gentamicin administration
confirmed nephrotoxicosis. Inconsistent serum uric acid concentrations could not 
be used to assess nephrotoxicosis.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Renal nuclear scintigraphy is a useful,
noninvasive means to determine renal function in birds. Although 99mTc-DMSA may
prove useful in the evaluation of renal morphology, Tc-DTPA is the
radiopharmaceutical agent of choice for the assessment of renal function in avian
species.

One-pot preparation of subnanometer-sized gold clusters via reduction and
stabilization by meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Negishi Y(1), Tsukuda T.

Author information: 
(1)Institute for Molecular Science, Myodaiji, Okazaki 444-8585, Japan.

We report herein a simple method to prepare subnanometer-sized gold clusters by
the reactions between hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (HAuCl4) and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA; HO2CCH(SH)CH(SH)CO2H) in water. It is
demonstrated that DMSA molecules efficiently reduce the Au(III) species and
stabilize the resultant gold clusters. The Au:DMSA clusters, which tend to
aggregate into assemblages in water, can be well-isolated from each other by
ion-pair formation between the carboxyl groups of DMSA and tetraoctylammonium
(TOA) cations. This surface modification enables us to examine the core size
distributions of the individual clusters by mass spectrometry and TEM. It is
revealed that the gold clusters comprised of 10-13 atoms (ca. 0.8 nm) are the
main products of the reactions.

We recently reported the effects of repeated administration of the monoisoamyl
ester of dimercaptosuccinic acid (MiADMSA) on a few selected biochemical
variables indicative of haematopoietic, liver, kidney and brain toxicity,
oxidative stress and essential metal status in male rats. The present
investigation studies similar changes in female rats to fi nd out if the changes 
are independent of gender. The results suggest significant and pronounced toxic
effects of MiADMSA on haem biosynthesis, liver and kidneys in female rats exposed
to higher doses of orally (p.o.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered
MiADMSA, compared with the effects in male rats. No effects on brain tissues were
seen. A pronounced depletion of copper was noted in the blood and liver of
MiADMSA administered rats, irrespective of route of exposure. It can be concluded
that the administration of MiADMSA in female rats is confounded with side-effects
and may require caution during its use and further exploration.

Using Tc-99m DMSA renal scan to detect renal damage in Taiwanese women with Type 
2 diabetes--a preliminary report.

Chang CH(1), Shiau YC, Lin CC, Kao CH, Hsu CH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, China Medical College Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.

In this preliminary study, we compared control women and Type 2 diabetes mellitus
(DM) women for the prevalence and type of renal damage as revealed by
technetium-99m dimercapto-succinic acid (Tc-99m DMSA) renal scan.METHODS: A total
of 20 control women and 60 women with Type 2 DM received Tc-99m DMSA renal scan
were included in this study. The 60 women with Type 2 DM were separated into
three groups: 20 women without UTI history, 20 patients with cystitis histories
only, and 20 with pyelonephritis histories.
RESULTS: All of the control women had normal Tc-99m DMSA renal scan findings.
However, 38.3% of Type 2 DM wonmen had abnormal Tc-99m DMSA renal scan findings. 
Type 2 DM women without UTI history had no abnormal scan findings. The prevalence
of abnormal renal scan findings was significantly higher in Type 2 DM women with 
pyelonephritis (90.0%) than with cystitis alone (25.0%). Renal scar findings were
found only in Type 2 DM women with pyelonephritis (40.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with control women, women with Type 2 DM, especially if
they had UTI and pyelonephritis histories, have a significantly higher prevalence
of abnormal Tc-99m DMSA renal scan findings.

AIM: To establish the variables that correlate with uptake defects in
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy performed in the acute phase of a
first episode of urinary tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in a cohort of 158
consecutive children with a first episode of symptomatic UTI. The therapeutic
delay time (TDT) was recorded. DMSA scintigraphy was performed in all children
and voiding cystourethrography in 150 of them.
RESULTS: 85% of the patients were younger than 2 y. Mean TDT was 33.5 h. The
aetiological agent was Escherichia coli in 140 children. DMSA scintigraphy was
normal in 81. Vesicoureteric reflux was detected in 33. After a multivariate
logistic regression analysis the following variables were retained in the final
model: TDT > or = 48 h, growth of bacteria other than E. coli, percentage of
polymorphonuclear cells > or = 60% and C-reactive protein > or = 30 mg l(-1).
CONCLUSION: TDT > or = 48 h, bacteria other than E. coli, percentage of
polymorphonuclear cells > or = 60% and CRP > or = 30 mg l(-1) influence the
findings detected in the DMSA scintigraphy performed in the acute phase of a
first episode of UTI.

Acute arsenic poisoning treated by intravenous dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and
combined extrarenal epuration techniques.

Louvain, Brussels, Belgium. hantson@rean.ucl.ac.be

Arsenic poisoning was diagnosed in a 26-year-old man who had been criminally
intoxicated over the last two weeks preceding admission by the surreptitious oral
administration of probably 10 g of arsenic trioxide (As2O3). The patient
developed severe manifestations of toxic hepatitis and pancreatitis, and
thereafter neurological disorders, respiratory distress, acute renal failure, and
cardiovascular disturbances. In addition to supportive therapy, extrarenal
elimination techniques and chelating agents were used. Dimercaprol (BAL) and
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA or succimer) were used simultaneously as arsenic
chelating agents for two days, and thereafter DMSA was used alone. DMSA was
administered by intravenous (20 mg/kg/d for five days, then 10 mg/kg/d for six
days) and intraperitoneal route. Intravenous DMSA infusion was well tolerated and
resulted in an increase in arsenic blood concentration immediately after the
infusion. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration combined with hemodialysis, and
peritoneal dialysis were proposed to enhance arsenic elimination. It was
calculated that over an 11-day period 14.5 mg arsenic were eliminated by the
urine, 26.7 mg by hemodialysis, 17.8 mg by peritoneal dialysis, and 7.8 mg by
continuous venovenous hemofiltration. These amounts appeared negligible with
regard to the probable ingested dose. The patient died on day 26 from the
consequences of multiple organ failure, with subarachnoid hemorrhage and
generalized infection caused by Aspergillus fumigatus.

Chronic arsenic toxicity due to drinking arsenic-contaminated water has been one 
of the worst environmental health hazards affecting eight districts of West
Bengal since the early eighties. Detailed clinical examination and investigation 
of 248 such patients revealed protean clinical manifestations of such toxicity.
Over and above hyperpigmentation and keratosis, weakness, anaemia, burning
sensation of eyes, solid swelling of legs, liver fibrosis, chronic lung disease, 
gangrene of toes, neuropathy, and skin cancer are some of the other
manifestations. A cross-sectional survey involving 7683 participants of all ages 
was conducted in an arsenic-affected region between April 1995 and March 1996.
Out of a population of 7683 surveyed, 3467 and 4216 people consumed water
containing As below and above 0.05 mg/L, respectively. Except pain abdomen the
prevalence of all other clinical manifestations tested (e.g., pigmentation,
keratosis, hepatomegaly, weakness, nausea, lung disease and neuropathy) were
found to be significantly higher in As exposed people (water As > 0.05 mg/L)
compared to control population (water As level < 0.05 mg/L). The prevalence of
pigmentation and keratosis, hepatomegaly, chronic respiratory disease and
weakness rose significantly with increasing arsenic concentrations in drinking
water. The respiratory effects were most pronounced in individuals with high
arsenic water concentrations who also had skin lesion. Therapy with chelating
agent DMSA was not found to be superior to placebo effect. However, therapy with 
DMPS caused significant improvement of clinical condition of chronic arsenicosis 
patients as evidenced by significant reduction of total clinical scores from 8.90
+/- 2.84 to 3.27 +/- 1.73; p < 0.0001. Efficacy of specific chelation therapy for
patients suffering from chronic As toxicity has further need to be fully
substantiated. However, supportive treatment could help in reducing many symptoms
of the patients. Treatment in hospital with good nutritious diet has been found
to reduce symptom score in a subset of placebo treated patients in West Bengal
during the course of DMSA and DMPS trial. People should be advised to stop
drinking As contaminated water or exposure to As from any other source. The
various clinical manifestations should be treated symptomatically.

Urinary infection was a problem in pediatrics. Currently the diagnosis is easy
but it is hard to diagnosis the localisation of the infection. We have to go fast
and precisely to treat correctly this infection and diminich the possibility of
developing renal scars. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy is a
reference exam for detection acute renal lesions. We have realised a prospective 
study in 29 children presenting urinary tract infection. In whom a DMSA
scintigraphy is realised between the one day and 30 days after the infection. We 
study the sensibility ans the specificity of clinical, biological and
radiological parameter for the diagnosis of localisation of the infection. The
better parameter of sensibility of upper urinary tract infection is of fever, and
the better parameter of specificity is the association of fever, echo Doppler
renal and VS.

Effects of dietary lead and/or dimercaptosuccinic acid exposure on regional
serotonin and serotonin metabolite content in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus

The lead (Pb) chelator, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) may be effective 
in reversing some of the adverse effects of Pb exposure. Pb-induced behavioral
deficits observed in fish are due to disruptions in the integrative functioning
of the medulla, cerebellum, and optic tectum. Pb exposure increased serotonin
(5-HT) content in all three brain regions without an effect on
5-hydroxy-3-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Pb exposure followed by no Pb in the diet
increased 5-HT and 5-HIAA content in all three brain regions. The replacement of 
dietary Pb with DMSA had no effect on 5-HT and increased 5-HIAA content. DMSA
increased 5-HIAA content in all three brain regions and increased 5-HT content
only the optic tectum. Treatment with DMSA may be more effective than removal of 
Pb from the diet in reversing Pb-induced alterations in 5-HT.

In congenital obstructed hydronephrosis, the assessment of the differential renal
function (DRF) is essential to provide a prognosis or to determine surgical
treatment. The most reliable method to measure the differential renal function is
the isotopic study with DMSA. The MAG-3 is employed to evaluation renal
elimination, although in the minutes 1-3 it also measures the differential renal 
function.OBJECTIVE: We compared the estimation of differential renal function by 
99Tc-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) and 99Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycyne (MAG-3)
methods in congenital unilateral uropathies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the results of 138 isotopic studies of
children (age range: 0-9 years) with congenital unilateral uropathies: 67 cases
were obstructed and 71 non-obstructed. In all of them were carried out match
tests pairs with DMSA and MAG-3. Both series were divided into 4 groups: 1) DRF <
40%, 2) DRF 40-45%, 3) DRF 46-50% and 4) DRF > 50%. The measurement differential 
renal function correlation by DMSA and MAG-3 were analysed.
RESULTS: The coefficient of correlation was 0.96 (P < 0.01) in obstructed
unilateral uropathy and 0.92 (P < 0.01) in non-obstructed serie.
CONCLUSIONS: The differential renal function measured with DMSA and MAG-3 has a
close correlation in congenital unilateral uropathies. Therefore in obstructed
types, differential renal function and half-time elimination can be reliable and 
sure studied with MAG-3, being unnecessary DMSA test, avoiding additional
radiation to the children.

Primary vesicoureteric reflux as a predictor of renal damage in children
hospitalized with urinary tract infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

London. I.Gordon@ich.ucl.ac.uk

Renal parenchymal disease after urinary tract infection (UTI) has been associated
with the development of hypertension and renal functional impairment. A
systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed to determine how
effectively the finding of primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) on micturating
cystography (MCU) in children hospitalized with UTI predicted renal parenchymal
disease on (99m)Technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy.
Medline, Embase, and PubMed were use to find reports with original data for
children hospitalized with bacteriologically-proven UTI who had undergone both
MCU and (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy, and which also reported both positive and
negative results of these tests. A meta-analysis of likelihood ratios positive
and negative for MCU was then performed, including tests for heterogeneity.
Twelve valid studies were found, seven with data for 537 children, with a
positive (99m)Tc-DMSA scan prevalence of 59% overall, and seven studies with data
for 1062 kidneys, with a positive (99m)Tc-DMSA scan prevalence of 36%. The
likelihood ratio positive for MCU was 1.96 (95% CI, 1.51 to 2.54) for children,
and 2.34 (1.53 to 3.57) for kidneys. The likelihood ratio negative was 0.71 (0.58
to 0.85) for children and 0.72 (0.61 to 0.86) for kidneys. There was evidence of 
heterogeneity. The meta-analysis showed that a positive MCU increases the risk of
renal damage in hospitalized UTI patients by about 20%, whereas a negative MCU
increases the chance of no renal involvement by just 8%. VUR is hence a weak
predictor of renal damage in pediatric patients hospitalized with UTI. Physicians
should be aware of the limitations of using MCU-detected primary VUR as an
effective screening test for renal damage in this population. Furthermore, the
pathogenesis of renal damage in such patients is probably complex because it is
often detected without demonstrable VUR.

Hacettepe, Turkey. bilgev@hacettepe.edu.tr

Demonstration of a congenital renal anomaly plays an important role in the
treatment of patients with renal infection. These patients are prone to
infections because of coexisting urinary tract anomalies such as duplicated
ureter, ureter opening anomalies, and urinary stasis. Assessment of renal
parenchymal damage resulting from acute or chronic renal infection is the primary
indication for radionuclide imaging with Tc-99m DMSA. In addition, this technique
allows congenital anomalies to be identified. The authors review congenital renal
fusion anomalies identified in children through Tc-99m DMSA imaging. They
conclude that Tc-99m DMSA imaging can reveal important diagnostic information
about various congenital anomalies, including fusion anomalies.

Power Doppler sonography versus Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy for diagnosing acute
pyelonephritis in children: are these two methods comparable?

Author information:

PURPOSE This study assessed the role of renal power Doppler ultrasonography (PDU)
to identify acute pyelonephritis (APN) and to determine whether PDU can replace
Tc-99m DMSA renal scintigraphy in the diagnosis of APN in children. METHODS A
prospective study was conducted in 40 infants and young children (78 kidneys were
evaluated) with a mean age of 25.9 months (range, 1 to 68 months) who were
hospitalized with a first episode of high fever and bacteruria, possibly APN. All
children were examined by PDU and Tc-99m DMSA within the first 3 days after
admission. Patients with congenital abnormalities, hydronephrosis, and urinary
reflux were excluded. RESULTS Twenty-seven of the 78 kidneys appeared abnormal on
Tc-99m DMSA, and 20 of them were abnormal on PDU. Fifty-one of 78 kidneys were
normal on Tc-99m DMSA, and 3 of 51 appeared diseased on PDU. The accuracy of PDU 
was 87%, sensitivity was 74%, and specificity was 94%. The positive predictive
and negative predictive values were both 87%. When considering the numbers of
lesions in 27 kidneys with positive Tc-99m DMSA studies (38 lesions), PDU did not
disclose 16 lesions (false-negative results). Thus, the sensitivity of PDU for
diagnosing lesions of APN decreased to 58%. CONCLUSIONS A positive PDU finding
should obviate the use of Tc-99m DMSA in patients thought to have possible APN.
However, because of a large number of false-negative results (26%) and
underestimation of the number of pyelonephritic lesions (low sensitivity of 58%),
PDU cannot replace Tc-99m DMSA in the diagnosis of APN in children.

Erratum in
    Urology. 2003 May;61(5):1078. Huang, Wen-Shen [corrected to Huang, Wen-Sheng].

OBJECTIVES: To compare control women with men and women with type 2 diabetes
mellitus (DM) for the prevalence and type of renal damage due to urinary tract
infections (UTIs) using technetium-99m dimercapto-succinic acid (99mTc DMSA)
renal scanning. Women with DM have UTIs more often than do women without DM. It
is unknown, however, what the prevalence and type of renal damage due to UTI are 
in these women.
METHODS: Three groups of patients: 28 control women without type 2 DM and a
history of UTIs, 25 male patients with type 2 DM but without a history of UTIs,
and 103 female patients with type 2 DM underwent 99mTc DMSA renal scan. The 103
women with type 2 DM were separated into three groups: 36 women without a history
of UTIs, 34 patients with a history of cystitis only, and 33 with a history of
pyelonephritis.
RESULTS: All the control women and male patients with type 2 DM without a history
of UTIs had normal 99mTc DMSA renal scan findings. However, 39.8% of women with
type 2 DM had abnormal 99mTc DMSA renal scan findings. Women with type 2 DM
without a history of UTI had a significantly lower prevalence of abnormal renal
scan findings than did those with a history of cystitis only or pyelonephritis.
In addition, the prevalence of abnormal renal scan findings was significantly
higher in women with type 2 DM with pyelonephritis than in those with a history
of cystitis only. Renal scars on 99mTc DMSA renal scans were found in women with 
type 2 DM and a history of pyelonephritis.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with control women and men with type 2 DM, women with type 
2 DM, especially if they had a history of UTIs, had a significantly higher
prevalence of abnormal 99mTc DMSA renal scan findings.

Functional evaluation by quantitative dimercaptosuccinic Acid scintigraphy after 
kidney trauma in children.

Moog R(1), Becmeur F, Dutson E, Chevalier-Kauffmann I, Sauvage P, Brunot B.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatric Surgery, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, 
France.

PURPOSE: Most pediatric surgical teams have adopted nonoperative treatment for a 
traumatic kidney lesion in children. In the emergency setting and at long-term
followup dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy enables us to identify the
consequences on global renal function as well as on the function of each
individual kidney.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight boys and 12 girls between 0.6 and 15.9 years old
(average age 9.7) were evaluated after including renal trauma, minor and major
injury in 10 each. Scintigraphy was performed 8 days and 6 months after injury.
The tracer used was 2 MBq./kg. Tc-DMSA. Semiquantitative analysis of the images
consisted of determining 2 parameters, namely relative renal function,
corresponding to the fraction of activity of a single kidney compared to the
activity of the 2 kidneys, and the calculated renal activity fraction,
corresponding to the function of each kidney compared with the activity of a
theoretical kidney in a child of the same age. The posttraumatic renal
scintigraphy series was paired with a series of healthy children matched by age, 
weight, height, sex and affected side of function as a control group. Global
renal function was also measured using a formula based on
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid scintigraphy with the height, weight and
increased serum creatinine in each patient.
RESULTS: For minor injuries the quantitative functional evaluation revealed a
significant average loss of renal function +/- SD on the side of the lesion
(12.8% +/- 3.1% versus 18.3% +/- 2%, p = 0.001). For major injuries on relative
renal function evaluation we noted an average 36-point difference in the damaged 
and contralateral kidneys 8 days after the accident. Six months after trauma we
noted a definitive loss of 48% in the calculated renal activity fraction on the
side of the lesion. There was no compensatory hypertrophy on the noninjured side 
when the calculated renal activity fraction was compared with that of a normal
kidney in a control patient (mean 19.1% +/- 4.2% versus 19.5% +/- 3.7%, not
significant). Creatinine clearance was normal in each patient. DISCUSSION A renal
contusion always induces parenchymal loss. Major kidney trauma has significant
consequences on the opposite side. At 6 months the presumably uninjured
contralateral kidney may be limited in its ability to compensate through
hypertrophy, which worsens the global renal functional prognosis of a traumatic
but initially unilateral lesion.
CONCLUSIONS: Posttraumatic functional evaluation by DMSA scintigraphy, which
measures the nephron capital of each kidney and the 2 together, seems essential
to inform patients about the seriousness of the lesion and lead them to an
eventual long-term nephrological followup with regular blood pressure assessment.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of tumor-seeking agent 99mTc(V)-DMSA in patients
with pharyngolaryngeal carcinoma and its biodistribution in human being.
METHOD: Planar and SPECT scintigraphy with 99mTc(V)-DMSA were performed in 12
patients with histologically confirmed pharyngolaryngeal carcinoma. The dynamic
distribution in patients was also analyzed.
RESULT: 9 cases (11 lesions) showed increased uptake by planar imaging and 11
cases (19 lesions) were clearly demonstrated by SPECT images. Furthermore,
distant metastatic lesions were showed in 5 patients. Biodistribution in patients
showed the accumulation of 99mTc(V)-DMSA in kidney was significantly greater than
other organs.
CONCLUSION: These results could suggested the clinical utility of 99mTc(V)-DMSA, 
specially with SPECT, for detecting primary pharyngolaryngealcarcinoma and their 
metastatic lesions (both local and distant). 99mTc(V)-DMSA Tumor-seeking agent

DmsD is required for the biogenesis of DMSO reductase in Escherichia coli but not
for the interaction of the DmsA signal peptide with the Tat apparatus.

Ray N(1), Oates J, Turner RJ, Robinson C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL,
UK.

The DmsD protein is essential for the biogenesis of DMSO reductase in Escherichia
coli, and binds the signal peptide of the DmsA subunit, a Tat substrate. This
suggests a role as a guidance factor to target pre-DmsA to the translocase. Here,
we have analysed the export of fusion proteins in which the DmsA and TorA signal 
peptides are fused to green fluorescent protein. Both chimeras are efficiently
exported to the periplasm in wild-type E. coli cells and we show that their
export efficiencies are essentially identical in a mutant lacking DmsD. An
authentic Tat substrate, TMAO reductase, is also efficiently exported in the dmsD
mutant. The data indicate that DmsD carries out a critical role in DMSO reductase
biogenesis/assembly but is not required for the functioning of the DmsA signal
peptide.

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) can lead to parenchymal lesions of the kidneys. Renal
scarring is an important cause of chronic renal failure and hypertension in
children. Effective prevention necessitates an early diagnosis of urinary tract
pathology. The aim of this work was to examine renal morphology and function in
VUR using radioisotope techniques and to compare the sensitivity of the planar
technique and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detection of
renal scarring. The following examinations were performed in 45 children with
VUR: ultrasonography, renoscintigraphy with technetium-99m-etylenedicysteine
(EC-Tc-99m) or technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA-Tc-99m) in planar and
SPECT modes. The stage of VUR correlated with cortical lesions as reflected by
effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and scarring as shown by static scintigraphy.
The use of SPECT increased diagnostic sensitivity in the case of small and
isolated scars. Thus, SPECT would be recommended in children at risk of renal
scarring. The correlation between ERPF and DMSA scintigraphy findings supports
the use of EC-Tc-99m renoscintigraphy to monitor the process of renal scarring.

Reduced Tc-99m DMSA uptake in a patient with renal tubular acidosis: effect of
acid-base imbalance.

Caglar M(1), Topaloğlu R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hacettepe University Medical Faculty, Ankara, 
Turkey. mcaglar@hacettepe.edu.tr

Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is used as a renal cortical imaging agent
to detect parenchymal abnormalities especially in children. Kidney uptake of DMSA
provides an index for evaluation of a functional tubular mass, which depends on
the renal blood flow and proximal tubular cell membrane transport function. We
here report a boy with renal tubular acidosis, which has noticeably reduced
uptake on his Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy, despite a totally normal Tc-99m MAG-3
study. The case reported here clearly demonstrates a situation in which renal
uptake of DMSA may be dissociated from a functional renal mass and the importance
of acid-base balance which alters Tc-99m DMSA uptake.

The efficacy of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was evaluated in workers 
occupationally exposed to lead (Pb; blood level >50 microg/dL). Ten men were
given 600 mg of DMSA per orem daily, for five days. Pb concentrations of whole
blood and urine were determined throughout therapy. Hematology analyses, blood
chemistry, and urinalysis were obtained at the start of the study, at the end of 
the DMSA treatment, and at 72 hours after the administration of the final dose.
DMSA therapy had no influence on hepatic, hematologic, or renal functions and was
effective in decreasing the concentration of blood Pb in all the subjects without
adverse drug reactions.

2,3-Dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
increase mercury- and cadmium-induced inhibition of delta-aminolevulinate
dehydratase.

Nogueira CW(1), Soares FA, Nascimento PC, Muller D, Rocha JB.

(1)Departamento de Quimica, Centro de Ciencias Naturais e Exatas, Universidade
Federal de Santa Maria, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.

Compounds derived from Dimercaprol, such as meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) and 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS), are becoming common
agents for treating humans exposed to heavy metals. Heavy metals such as Pb(2+), 
Hg(2+) and Cd(2+) can inhibit delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (delta-ALA-D)
activity. Delta-ALA-D catalyzes the condensation of two delta-aminolevulinic acid
(delta-ALA) molecules with the formation of porphobilinogen, a heme precursor.
The effects of DMSA and DMPS alone or in combination with Cd(2+), Hg(2+), or
Pb(2+) on hepatic delta-ALA-D were examined. DMPS and DMSA caused a
dose-dependent inhibition of hepatic delta-ALA-D. In the presence of Hg(2+) or
Cd(2+) the inhibitory potency of DMPS increased. Similarly, the inhibitory
effects of Hg(2+) and Cd(2+) were markedly increased in the presence of DMSA. In 
contrast, the inhibitory effect of DMPS was not changed by inclusion of Pb(2+).
As observed with DMSA, Zn(2+) did not modified the inhibitory effect of DMPS.
Data of the present report support the idea that the complexes formed
(metals-DMSA or DMPS) were more inhibitory than the metal (Hg(2+) and Cd(2+)) or 
the chelating agent alone to the hepatic delta-ALA-D activity, in vitro. The
mechanism of hepatic delta-ALA-D inhibition by Hg(2+)-DMPS/DMSA and
Cd(2+)-DMPS/DMSA complexes involve the essential thiol groups of the enzyme.

'Yo-yo' reflux in an incompletely duplicated renal system was demonstrated on
(99m)Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) renal scintigraphy in a 7-year-old girl
presenting with low-grade fever and pyelonephritis. Incomplete duplication and a 
bifid renal pelvis, which may be seen in up to 4% of the North American
population, occasionally causes symptoms because of recurrent urinary tract
infection or loin pain. (99m)Tc-MAG3 renal scintigraphy can demonstrate 'yo-yo'
reflux in patients with incomplete renal duplication and should be considered in 
cases with unexplained loin pain, even if (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) 
renal scintigraphy is normal.

Autism, an extreme challenge to integrative medicine. Part 2: medical management.

Kidd PM.

Autism and allied autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) present myriad behavioral,
clinical, and biochemical abnormalities. Parental participation, advanced testing
protocols, and eclectic treatment strategies have driven progress toward cure.
Behavioral modification and structured education are beneficial but insufficient.
Dietary restrictions, including removal of milk and other casein dairy products, 
wheat and other gluten sources, sugar, chocolate, preservatives, and food
coloring are beneficial and prerequisite to benefit from other interventions.
Individualized IgG or IgE testing can identify other troublesome foods but not
non-immune mediated food sensitivities. Gastrointestinal improvement rests on
controlling Candida and other parasites, and using probiotic bacteria and
nutrients to correct dysbiosis and decrease gut permeability. Detoxification of
mercury and other heavy metals by DMSA/DMPS chelation can have marked benefit.
Documented sulfoxidation-sulfation inadequacies call for sulfur-sulfhydryl
repletion and other liver p450 support. Many nutrient supplements are beneficial 
and well tolerated, including dimethylglycine (DMG) and a combination of
pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and magnesium, both of which benefit roughly half of ASD 
cases. Vitamins A, B3, C, and folic acid; the minerals calcium and zinc; cod
liver oil; and digestive enzymes, all offer benefit. Secretin, a triggering
factor for digestion, is presently under investigation. Immune therapies
(pentoxifyllin, intravenous immunoglobulin, transfer factor, and colostrum)
benefit selected cases. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids offer great promise.
Current pharmaceuticals fail to benefit the primary symptoms and can have marked 
adverse effects. Individualized, in-depth clinical and laboratory assessments and
integrative parent-physician-scientist cooperation are the keys to successful ASD
management.

Renal parenchymal defects (RPD) -- scars, hypoplasia/dysplasia -- in children are
a major risk factor for chronic renal failure. Most authors would agree that RPD 
should be detected and followed by a 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan
(DMSA), as ultrasonography (US) does not seem to be sensitive enough for this
purpose. However, it might well be that DMSA is too sensitive and detects RPD
that are too small to be clinically significant. The purpose of this study was to
evaluate the sensitivity of US in identifying patients with clinically
significant RPD and in detecting RPD of various grades as seen by DMSA. In 89
children with abnormal DMSA, a second DMSA, US, and other tests for evaluating
renal function were performed at least 1 year after the first DMSA. The extent of
RPD detected by DMSA and US was correlated with renal function parameters. In all
5 patients with diminished renal function, RPD were detected by both DMSA scan
and US. In addition, US detected clinically insignificant RPD in 48 of 67 cases
(71.6%). The present study has shown that, compared with DMSA, US is sensitive
enough to detect clinically significant RPD in children. The substitution of DMSA
with US would be beneficial, as this would eliminate radiation exposure, reduce
costs, and increase availability.

Technology, Haifa, Israel.

PURPOSE: Radical nephrectomy is a routine urological practice. However, little is
known about the use of dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scan to evaluate
compensatory changes after surgery and its ability to identify patient at risk
for postoperative chronic renal failure or insufficiency. We predicted remaining 
kidney function using DMSA scan and serum creatinine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 42 patients were enrolled in the study. All
underwent DMSA scan before surgery and in 38 DMSA scan was done after unilateral 
nephrectomy. Serum creatinine was determined before and 1 year after surgery. The
Student t test was used to determine statistical significance. Spearman rank core
analysis was used to evaluate the association of calculated creatinine clearance 
time after surgery and renal absolute uptake before surgery. We performed 1-way
ANOVA comparison of the means to determine the influence of age distribution on
kidney hypertrophy and the increase in kidney uptake.
RESULTS: Average patient age was 61.5 years. Baseline mean creatinine clearance
time was 71.5 ml. per minute, which decreased to 58.6 ml. per minute after
nephrectomy (p <0.0001). Before surgery DMSA scan of the remaining kidney
demonstrated an absolute uptake of 4.2% higher than that in the resected kidney
(13.5% versus 9.35%, p = 0.0008). After nephrectomy the remaining kidney had an
average increase of 3.9% of mean absolute uptake (17.7% versus 13.8%, p =
0.0001). Spearman rank core analysis demonstrated an association of higher
preoperative absolute uptake in the remaining kidney with postoperatively high
creatinine clearance time (r = 0.458, p = 0.003). Furthermore, 75% of patients
with postoperative creatinine clearance time less than 40 ml. per minute
presented with a preoperative absolute uptake of lower than 11% in the remaining 
kidney. In contrast, 75% of those with a postoperative creatinine clearance time 
of higher than 40 ml. per minute had a preoperative absolute uptake of higher
than 11%.
CONCLUSIONS: A preoperative absolute uptake of lower than 11% in the remaining
kidney was a significant risk factor for postoperative chronic renal
insufficiency.

PURPOSE: To reduce the incidence of nephrectomy or hydronephrosis in children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 1998 to October 2000, we treated 58
patients with hydronephrosis; their ages ranged from 35 days to 11 years (mean
age 4 years 7 months). All patients were subjected to a DTPA renogram with split 
function. In 12 patients (study group), kidney function was less than 10 % (range
0 - 10 %). Initially, nephrostomy was carried out in all 12 patients followed by 
Anderson-Hyne's pyeloplasty after 4 - 6 weeks. Postoperatively renal USG, urine
r/m/e & c/s (routine and microscopic examination and culture and sensitivity
test), blood urea, serum creatinine were assessed and DMSA scan and DTPA renogram
with split functions were carried out in all patients.
RESULTS: In the study group, all 12 patients showed improvement of renal function
(more than 10 %) after nephrostomy and in all of them pyeloplasty was
subsequently carried out within 4 - 6 weeks. There were no significant pre-,
peri- or postoperative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to common practice we do not recommend nephrectomy for
hydronephrotic kidneys which show < 10 % of renal function on renogram. The renal
functional status improves significantly after a preliminary nephrostomy, thus
avoiding the need for a straightforward nephrectomy in children along with all
the possible long-term effects of a single kidney.

Several radiopharmaceuticals and imaging techniques are proposed for breast
cancer imaging. Since limited data are available of the uptake of SPECT and PET
radiopharmaceuticals in malignant breast tumors and their metastases the aim of
this study was to compare the uptake values and to correlate these data with
imaging findings.METHODS: We have studied the uptake of F-18 FDG, Tc-99m MIBI and
Tc-99m (V)DMSA in 31 tumors using immunosuppressed rats implanted with HH-16
clone 4 mammary tumor cells. Tumor gamma camera and PET imaging was performed to 
gain biokinetic data and uptake values by ROI-analysis.
RESULTS: Tumor uptake was highest for F-18 FDG > Tc-99m (V)DMSA > Tc-99m MIBI.
The uptake ratios (tumor to muscle) correlated well with the ratios calculated by
ROI-analysis determined by imaging.
CONCLUSIONS: In this in-vivo model, F-18 FDG revealed the best uptake and imaging
properties and may be the radiopharmaceutical of choice for routine breast cancer
imaging.

Haematological, hepatic and renal alterations after repeated oral or
intraperitoneal administration of monoisoamyl DMSA. I. Changes in male rats.

Monoisoamyl 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (MiADMSA), a vicinal thiol chelator, is
gaining recognition recently as a better chelator than meso
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in decreasing heavy metal burden in tissues
because of its lipophilic character. There is, however, little information
available on the toxicological properties of this chelator after repeated
administration in animals. In the present study, we investigated the
dose-dependent effect of MiADMSA on various biochemical parameters suggestive of 
alterations in haem biosynthesis and hepatic, renal and brain oxidative stress
after 21 days of repeated intraperitoneal (i.p.) or oral (p.o.) administration to
rats. The concentration of essential metals in blood and soft tissues was
determined along with histopathological observations of hepatic and renal
tissues. The results suggest that MiADMSA administration had no effect on blood
delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity. However, an increase in zinc
protoporphyrin and a decrease in haemoglobin levels were noted in animals given
MiADMSA i.p. A moderate increase in serum alkaline phosphatase suggested mild
hepatotoxicity at the highest dose (100 mg kg(-1), i.p.). This was confirmed by
histopathological examinations, which identified basophilic stippling,
granulation of the cytoplasm, haemorrhage and congestion. At the highest dose,
levels of hepatic thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and oxidized glutathione
were increased above those of control values. Levels of hepatic reduced
glutathione were decreased. Taken together, these observations point to oxidative
stress. In animals administered MiADMSA i.p. there was an increase in the brain
malondialdehyde levels at the two higher doses (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)). Essential 
metal status revealed a significant effect of MiADMSA (p.o.) in increasing blood 
zinc while significantly decreasing the kidney zinc level. The most significant
adverse effect of MiADMSA was on copper concentration, which showed significant
depletion from almost all major organs. Magnesium levels in blood decreased but
increased in liver of MiADMSA-administered rats. Histopathological observations
of liver and kidneys suggest few moderate lesions. It can be concluded that
repeated administration of MiADMSA is compromised with some mild toxic effect,
particularly the loss of copper. The effects during oral administration are
comparatively less pronounced than by the i.p. route.

BACKGROUND: Neonatal arterial hypertension is rare with an incidence between 0.2 
- 3 %. Clinical presentation varies widely and is in some cases dramatic.
PATIENT: A 4-day old full-term neonate was admitted to the intensive care unit
with severe congestive heart failure and metabolic acidosis. Mechanical
ventilation was initiated and dobutamine administered because of poor systolic
function. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure revealed severe arterial
hypertension (30 to 40 mm Hg above the 95th percentile). Ultrasonography showed
an echogenic left kidney with normal perfusion. Laboratory examinations revealed 
a raised peripheral renin activity, thrombocytopenia, slightly raised d-dimers, a
microhematuria and mild proteinuria. After resolution of hypertension under
therapy with an ACE-inhibitor, a MAG3 renal scan showed complete absence of renal
function on the left side. Renal artery stenosis was excluded by venous
transcardial angiography. Under therapy with Captopril, the patient was
discharged and followed up for 8 months. He is developing normally with normal
serum creatinine (0.4 mg/dl), but low renal function (17 %) of the left side as
assessed by DMSA-scan and compensatory right kidney hypertrophy are observed.
DISCUSSION: Diagnosis and treatment of neonatal hypertension are discussed with
respect to the proposed case. After exclusion of other causes we conclude that a 
perinatal microangiopathic event may have lead to the renal lesions with
malignant renovascular hypertension.

Many radiotracers are available for kidney studies. They are classified into
glomerular tracers (DTPA, EDTA), tubular tracers (OIH, MAG3) and cortical tracers
(DMSA, GHA). Renal function is best assessed by glomerular filtration rate.
Camera studies provide a relative function assessment, whereas clearance
techniques provide a precise and reliable assessment of absolute renal function. 
The combination of both therefore gives a comprehensive study of glomerular
function. Attempts to assess absolute function from camera studies only resulted 
in gross inaccuracy. Tubular tracers have a higher extraction rate. This could be
used to estimate renal plasma flow (by assessing the effective renal plasma
flow), or to determine relative function when renal function is low, or to study 
the urine flow in the urinary tract. Cortical tracers provide a high imaging
quality. They are more adapted to infection assessment and relative function
measurements. This paper reviews the most commonly used tracers and their
relationship with renal physiology. Techniques for camera static and dynamic
studies and plasma and urinary clearances are detailed. Procedures follow the
recommendations of the most recent international consensus conferences on the
topics.

During the month of September-October 1997, a depression storm caused massive
flooding in the area of western Kanchanaburi province, Thailand, causing
lead-contaminated water from a nearby lead refinery plant to spill into the
surrounding areas of Clitty Creek; exposing the village downstream to large
amounts of lead. The Ministry of Public Health, together with the Ministry of
Science, the Ministry of Industry, and officials from the Kanchanaburi Office of 
Public Health, began measures for environmental deleading and assessment of
exposure and health risks of the population.METHOD: This was a retrospective
cohort study of the effects that environmental remediation and chelation therapy 
had on the blood lead levels of children residing in Lower Clitty Creek Village
during the period between 1997-2001. Sixty-eight children were followed yearly
for their blood lead levels and hematocrit, beginning in early 1998.
Simultaneously, programs for environmental remediation had begun. The blood lead 
levels (BLLs) of children were followed over a 3-year period. The BLLs during the
2 year period of environmental remediation alone were compared. Subsequently,
when chelation therapy was instituted, levels pre and post chelation therapy, as 
well as the efficacy of the two different chelation methods were compared using
standard 2-tailed t-test.
RESULTS: The initial average BLL was 27.75 +/- 5.4 mg/dl (1998). After
environmental remediation began, BLL at one year (1999) was 30.64 +/- 4.49 mg/dl 
(p = 0.072), and at two years (2000) was 30.30 +/- 5.1 mg/dl (p = 0.537). There
were 18 children with BLLs > 25 who were elected to receive chelation therapy
with CaNa2EDTA (11) and DMSA (7). Post chelation average BLL was 18.73 +/- 7.50
mg/dl. The difference between pre and post chelation BLL was statistically
significant (p < 0.001: paired t-test). The differences in average BLLs between
pre and post chelation for the EDTA group was 15.37 mg/dl and for the DMSA group 
it was 8.91 mg/dl. Children treated with EDTA appeared, on average, to have 6.47 
mg/dl (p < 0.05: 95% CI (0.821-12.12)) lower BLL than those treated with DMSA.
CONCLUSION: The incident at Clitty Creek serves to illustrate the importance of
environmental remediation as a priority to treating lead poisoning in children.
Only when effective environmental deleading has taken place can medical
intervention in the form of chelation therapy begin.

Is furosemide administration effective in improving the accuracy of determination
of differential renal function by means of technetium-99m DMSA in patients with
hydronephrosis.

It has been suggested that determination of differential renal function
(DRF)using technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) may lead to
overestimation of the function of an obstructed kidney in patients with excretion
abnormalities owing to pelvic retention of DMSA. Recently published guidelines
have recommended use of furosemide injection when calculating DRF in these
particular patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of diuretic
administration on the determination of DRF using DMSA scintigraphy. For this
purpose, 19 patients, aged from 1 month to 69 years (19.4+/-24.8 years, 15 males,
4 females), in whom pelvic retention had been documented by diuresis scintigraphy
were included in the study. DMSA scintigraphy was performed in all patients 2-4 h
after injection and six planar images were obtained. Immediately after the
standard study, furosemide was injected in all patients, and 30 min later the
same number of images was obtained. DRF was calculated for each patient and from 
each DMSA study by using the arithmetic mean method. The difference between two
studies (DMSA scintigraphy with or without furosemide administration and diuresis
scintigraphy) was expressed as a percentage of the mean value of the two studies 
(the DRF value of the affected kidney was thus taken into account). The mean of
the differences represented the systemic bias and the SD of the mean of the
differences represented the precision of the technique. In seven patients,
diuresis renography revealed an obstructive curve pattern. We did not observe any
significant difference between the DRF values obtained before and after diuretic 
administration ( P>0.5). When we compared DRF values obtained from standard and
from diuretic DMSA studies, the mean of the differences was only 0.3% and the SD 
was only 1.2%. There was also no significant difference in DRF between patients
with the obstructive curve pattern and those with a dilated renogram curve
pattern (with washout of activity during the second phase of the study) ( P>0.1).
In conclusion, we did not observe interference from pelvicalyceal activity in
patients with documented pelvic retention and infer that diuretic administration 
may be a useless intervention for improving the accuracy of determination of DRF.

The active transport of Krebs cycle intermediates, such as succinate,
alpha-ketoglutarate, and citrate, is mediated by sodium-coupled transporters
found in the luminal (NaDC-1) and basolateral plasma membranes (NaDC-3) of
proximal tubule cells. This study used the two-electrode voltage clamp technique 
to examine steady-state currents associated with the influx of three sodium ions 
and one divalent dicarboxylate into oocytes expressing the sodium-dicarboxylate
transporter from winter flounder kidney, fNaDC-3. The substrate concentration,
where half-maximal current was observed (K(0.5)), was 30 micro M for succinate.
Besides 2,2-dimethylsuccinate, fNaDC-3 also accepted 2,3-dimethylsuccinate and
the oral lead-chelating agent, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA or Succimer).
Whereas the K(0.5) for succinate and 2,2-dimethylsuccinate was independent of
membrane voltage within -90 and -10 mV, K(0.5) for 2,3-dimethylsuccinate and
2,3-dimercaptosuccinate increased with decreasing voltage, indicating a critical 
role of the position of the methyl- or sulfhydryl-group in voltage-sensitive
affinity. In addition to meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate, fNaDC-3 translocated
dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS or Dimaval), an oral chelator for the
treatment of mercury intoxication. The chelates formed by HgCl(2) and DMSA or
DMPS and by Pb(NO(3))(2) and DMSA, however, were not translocated by fNaDC-3. The
data suggest that NaDC-3 is an essential component in the delivery of uncomplexed
antidotes for renal heavy metal detoxification.

Anti microbial activity of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA): a new chelating agent.

Vineeta N(1), Singh V, Makkar S.

(1)Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, D.A.V (C) Dental
College, Yamuna Nagar, Haryana.

Successful outcome of endodontic treatment depends on elimination of bacteria and
their products present in the root canal. It has been reported that after careful
chemicomechanical preparation, smear layer is formed on the walls of canal, which
contains bacteria and their products. Chelating agents, when used during
chemicomechanical preparation, remove the smear layer. DMSA--a new chelating
agent, when used in root canals, removes the smear layer more than EDTA when used
as irrigant in root canals. This study was conducted to determine whether DMSA
has anti microbial activity and compare it with EDTA. The results show that EDTA 
(10% & 15%) had marked anti microbial activity, both on culture plates and in
broth. DMSA (10% & 15%) did not show anti microbial activity on culture plates
while in broth it had marked activity.

Epidemiological studies on arsenic contamination in drinking water indicated
presence of arsenic in fetal tissues. Experiments on human fetal brain explants
on exposure to arsenic in culture showed disturbance in lipid peroxidation,
generation of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis. The
oxidative stress challenged by antioxidant vitamins C, E or chelator
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) may reverse arsenic toxicity on neuronal
development. The concept was tested with the models: (A) human fetal brain
explants exposed to arsenic, 0.3 mg/l in culture for 24 h; (B) rat neonatal brain
explants from 1-day-old litters exposed to 0.3 mg/l arsenic in drinking water
during gestation. Rats (n=10) were given oral administration of vitamin C, 2.5
mg/kg/day, vitamin E, 148 microg/kg/day during gestation and DMSA, 50 mg/kg for 2
days at the end of gestation. (A) The arsenic induced in human fetal brain
explants increase in production of NO, 20% and ROS, 25%, and decrease in DNA, 62%
and protein, 54% synthesis. The morphological analyses showed growth of viable
cells, neural networking vis-à-vis apoptosis on exposure to arsenic for 24 h and 
necrosis and loss of ground matrix on arsenic exposure for 18 days. The
occurrence of two processes of apoptosis and necrosis in different neurons of
same culture indicated existence of a selective cellular defense against arsenic 
toxicity. (B) The rats exposed to arsenic showed increased generation of NO, 25% 
and ROS, 22%, loss of glutathione content from 42 to 35 microg/mg protein, 40%
increase in lipid peroxidation and decreased superoxide dismutase at 32%. The
administration of vitamins C, E and DMSA showed partial reversal of the effects
indicating possible protection from arsenic toxicity.

The influence of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, on the therapeutic
efficacy of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), a hydrophilic, and its
ester, monoisoamyl 2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (MiADMS), a lipophilic, both soft
tissue lead mobilizers, was investigated in lead-preexposed rats. The subsequent 
treatment of lead-exposed animals with DMSA, MiADMS, or NAC reversed the
lead-induced alterations in blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase,
catalase, malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione, and
brain MDA levels. The combined treatment with DMSA and NAC was more effective
than that with MiADMS and NAC in enhancing the restoration of all these
parameters indicative of lead-induced oxidative stress. These reversals were
consistent with the lead-removing ability of DMSA and MiADMS but not that of NAC.
As the reversal of these parameters by NAC was independent of its lead-mobilizing
capability, this ought to be mainly due to its strong antioxidant property. The
increase in blood and brain zinc levels upon lead exposure appears to be the
result of the redistribution of endogenous zinc due to lead. Subsequent treatment
with DMSA, MiADMS, NAC, or their combination decreased the brain zinc as its
excretable complexes with a transient increase in blood zinc level. The ideal
treatment of lead poisoning seems to be a combination of a lead chelator and an
antioxidant.

vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and to present the results of our current protocol.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty three patients with VUR were retrospectively studied 
with a mean follow-up of 43 years (1-11 years). VUR was diagnosed by voiding
cystourethrography and followed-up by direct radionuclide cystography. During the
follow-up all patients were studied by means of renal DMSA scintigraphy (21 were 
also studied during the acute phase of febrile urinary tract infection).
RESULTS: Eighty three renal units were examined. Voiding cystourethrography was
positive for VUR in 49 renal units (59%; 8 grade I, 18 grade II, 15 grade III,
and 8 grade IV). During the follow-up, direct radionuclide cystography showed
decrease or disappearance of VUR in 29 renal units (35%; 4 grade I, 16 grade II, 
7 grade III, and 2 grade IV). DMSA studies performed during the follow-up showed 
cortical lesions in 17 renal units (5 with VUR grade II, 7 with grade III, and 5 
grade IV). Nine of 21 patients examined by DMSA during the acute phase of febrile
urinary tract infection showed cortical damage (43%), and 6 of them (67%)
progressed to cortical lesion in the follow-up DMSA.
CONCLUSIONS: The present protocol allows for the correct diagnosis and control of
VUR, the early detection of acute renal damage, and the control of its evolution.

(99m)Tc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans can provide accurate diagnosis
of acute pyelonephritis, its sequelae (renal scars) and differential renal
function (DRF). The purposes of this retrospective study were (1) to assess the
relationship between DRF obtained during acute pyelonephritis and at follow-up,
and (2) to elucidate the value of initial DRF in predicting subsequent renal
scars. A total of 47 children were enrolled. All had both unilateral acute
pyelonephritis diagnosed by initial DMSA renal scans, and follow-up DMSA renal
scans. We found the correlation between initial and follow-up DRF poor (adjusted 
R2 = 0.396). Whether or not renal scars developed determined the follow-up DRF.
Vesicoureteral reflux was significantly more common in children who developed
renal scars. In addition, the higher the grade of vesicoureteral reflux, the
lower the follow-up DRF and the improvement in DRF. When using a DRF of 46% as
the cut-off value to predict subsequent renal scars, the sensitivity and
specificity were 47.8% and 83.3%, respectively. Owing to the low sensitivity,
initial DRF is not suitable for predicting the occurrence of renal scars.

Model-based comparison of maternal and foetal organ doses from (99m)Tc
pertechnetate, DMSA, DTPA, HDP, MAA and MAG(3) diagnostic intakes during
pregnancy.

Bristol, Bristol Oncology Centre, Horfield Road, Bristol BS2 8ED, UK.

Organ residence times were calculated for diagnostic intakes of (99m)Tc
pertechnetate, 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), diethylene triamine
penta-acetic acid (DTPA), hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HDP), macroaggregated
albumin (MAA) and mercapto-acetyltriglycine (MAG(3)) during the 1st and 3rd
stages of pregnancy and used with the MIRDOSE3 pregnant female phantoms for
generation of dose estimates. At stage 3 individual foetal organ doses were
estimated via a surrogate phantom based on that for the new-born but with mean
dose/cumulated activity ( S) values scaled for compatibility with foetal whole
body S. Stage 1 or 3 whole foetus doses ranged from 5.2 to 0.77 microGy MBq(-1)
respectively, analogous to current ICRP estimates for these agents using similar 
in vivo biodistribution model databases. Most stage 3 maternal and foetal organ
doses were similar within a factor of 3, being higher in the foetus than the
mother with pertechnetate, DTPA and MAG(3), and lower with DMSA, HDP and MAA.
Doses were more uniformly distributed among foetal organs than in the mother.
Placental transfer was greatest with pertechnetate, where dose to the stage 3
foetal thyroid was 60-140 microGy MBq(-1). With each agent there was more
placental transfer in stage 3 than in stage 1, but doses to stage 1 whole foetus 
were always higher, with the contribution from the mother dominant. For DMSA, HDP
and MAG(3) the maternal contribution to total foetal body dose exceeded 93% for
both stages.

Differential effects of a molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase (moeB) mutation on
Escherichia coli molybdoenzyme maturation.

Sambasivarao D(1), Turner RJ, Bilous PT, Rothery RA, Shaw G, Weiner JH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

We have generated a chromosomal mutant of moeB (moeBA228T) that demonstrates
limited molybdenum cofactor (molybdo-bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)
(Mo-bisMGD)) availability in Escherichia coli and have characterized its effect
on the maturation and physiological function of two well-characterized
respiratory molybdoenzymes: the membrane-bound dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) reductase
(DmsABC) and the membrane-bound nitrate reductase A (NarGHI). In the moeBA228T
mutant strain, E. coli F36, anaerobic respiratory growth is possible on nitrate
but not on DMSO, indicating that cofactor insertion occurs into NarGHI but not
into DmsABC. Fluorescence analyses of cofactor availability indicate little
detectable cofactor in the moeBA228T mutant compared with the wild-type,
suggesting that NarGHI is able to scavenge limiting cofactor, whereas DmsABC is
not. MoeB functions to sulfurylate MoaD, and in the structure of the MoeB-MoaD
complex, Ala-228 is located in the interface region between the two proteins.
This suggests that the moeBA228T mutation disrupts the interaction between MoeB
and MoaD. In the case of DmsABC, despite the absence of cofactor, the
twin-arginine signal sequence of DmsA is cleaved in the moeBA228T mutant,
indicating that maturation of the holoenzyme is not cofactor-insertion dependent.

BACKGROUND: Partial nephrectomy (PNx) has been performed with temporary renal
arterial occlusion and in situ renal hypothermia (conventional PNx). However, the
impact of temporary renal arterial occlusion on residual renal function has not
been well assessed. To address this question, we performed renal scintigraphy
with (99m)technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) for the quantitative
measurement of postoperative residual renal function after conventional PNx and
partial nephrectomy without arterial occlusion (non-clamping PNx).
METHODS: Thirty-four patients underwent postoperative DMSA scintigraphy after PNx
for renal cell carcinoma. No obvious difference in preoperative renal function
between the diseased kidney and the contralateral kidney was found in any of the 
patients. Of these patients, 24 underwent conventional PNx, and 10 underwent
non-clamping PNx. Residual renal function was evaluated using the relative DMSA
uptake of the operated kidney.
RESULTS: The relative DMSA uptake of the operated kidney was 39.9 +/- 7.3%
(25.1-58.8) after conventional PNx compared to 34.8 +/- 8.9% (13.5-45.5) after
non-clamping PNx. This difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15).
Total ischemic time during conventional PNx had no adverse influence on the
residual renal function. In the analysis of the other determinant factors
influencing residual renal function, tumor size was the only significant factor
that inversely correlated with the relative DMSA uptake.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that arterial clamping during PNx has no negative 
impact on the functional residual capacity as long as insitu renal hypothermia is
adequately performed.

Preparation and biological evaluation of the new chlorin photosensitizer T3,4BCPC
for detection and treatment of tumors.

The new water-soluble photosensitizer
5,10,15,20-tetrakis[3,4-bis(carboxymethyleneoxy)phenyl]chlorin (T3,4BCPC) has
been prepared, characterized and labeled with 99mTc radionuclide. The radiotracer
was evaluated for tissue distribution in Wistar rats. Accumulation of
administrated activities in the liver, kidney, bladder and large intestine at 4 h
post-injection indicated that the labeled ligand was largely eliminated through
the renal and partly through the hepatobiliary system. In vivo biodistribution
studies of the labeled compound were carried out in rodent and murine tumor
models in comparison with other tumor-seeking radiopharmaceuticals such as
99mTc(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 201thallous chloride (TlCl) and
99mTc-citrate using a gamma camera computer system. In N-nitrosomethylurea
(NMU)-induced rat mammary tumors, the labeled ligand showed a five-fold tumor to 
muscle (T/M) ratio compared to 99mTc(V)-DMSA (3-fold) and 201TlCl (3-fold). In
the case of C(3)H/J virus-induced spontaneous mammary tumors, the differences
were not marked. However, in the transplanted rat C(6)-glioma, the T/M ratio of
the labeled compound was appreciably higher (four-fold) than that noted with
99mTc(V)-DMSA (two-fold), 201TlCl (three-fold) and 99mTc-citrate (more than
three-fold). These findings suggest that the radiolabeled T3,4BCPC may have
potential for the detection of cancer. In order to ascertain the efficacy of the 
compound for photodynamic therapy applications, a preclinical PDT study was
carried out in fibrosarcoma-bearing mice after injecting 5.0 mg/kg body weight of
the T3,4BCPC. A laser dose of 20 mW for 60 s resulted in 80% destruction of
tumors. These data suggest that this molecule could be useful for PDT of cancer. 
The labeled agent could also be useful in monitoring the progression/regression
of tumors before, during, and after chemotherapy, radiation therapy or PDT.

[Influence of the early renal status on natural history of vesico-ureteral reflux
diagnosed in the first six month of life].

INTRODUCTION: Ultrasonographic and radionuclide imaging of kidney in presence of 
major vesicoureteric reflux, diagnosed in the first months of life, reflects a
congenital anomaly of development of ureteric bud and metanephric blastema, more 
than a parenchymal damage secondary to superimposed infections. These lesions are
mainly observed in male infants affected by reflux and referred on the basis of a
prenatal diagnosis. The impact of therapy on these kidneys is still debated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 273 pediatric patients with VUR observed between 1991
and 2000, 48 cases have been selected where a reflux grade III or greater had
been diagnosed within the first six months of life. Cause of admission was
prenatal diagnosis in 29 cases and recurrent infection in 19. Reflux was
bilateral in 30 patients. Cases of VUR associated to other urological or
neurological anomalies were excluded. A complete ultrasonographic, cystographic
and radionuclide study was performed in all patients included in the present
study within the fourth month of life. Mean Follow up lasted 17 months. Renal
damage was graded by ultrasonography and DMSA renal scan on the basis or of a
reduction in total kidney size and a poor radionuclide uptake either of an
altered renal profile associated to focal defects of uptake.
RESULTS: Resolution of reflux within the mean follow up period, was observed in
16 patients, even with high grade VUR, whenever major renal lesions were absent
or focal. When severe renal damage was initially demonstrated the expectancy of
reduction or resolution of VUR was significantly reduced and surgical option was 
considered.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with major VUR diagnosed in the first months of life,
early renal status affects prognosis more than the severity of reflux.

Nuclear medicine studies in the dialysis patient.

Nuclear medicine (scintigraphy) studies that are performed in patients being
prepared for regular dialysis treatment include the measurement of renal
clearance and dynamic studies of renal perfusion and function. Static
scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA may be used in the evaluation of children at risk of
renal damage and further functional deterioration. In patients on peritoneal
dialysis, nuclear medicine procedures enable the diagnosis of structural
complications such as intra-abdominal herniations and leaks. Diagnosis of
infections of the vascular access sites in patients on hemodialysis and of the
catheter tunnel in patients on peritoneal dialysis can be made with high
diagnostic accuracy using radiolabeled, autologous leukocytes. Scintigraphy is
valuable in delineating the extent of deposits of amyloid and parenchymal
microcalcifications, and may be helpful in the functional evaluation of organs
and tissues involved in the pathophysiology of renal impairment and dialysis. If 
radioiodine therapy with 131I is performed in patients on hemodialysis with
benign or malignant thyroid disease, then pretherapeutic dosimetry is necessary
to avoid over- and undertreatment. Radioiodine therapy in the dialysis patient
leads to only insignificant contamination of dialysis equipment and marginal
exposure to the medical staff.

Relationship of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), urinary tract infection (UTI) and
subsequent renal scarring nowadays is still in question. This study aimed to
determine 1) the incidence of cortical scarring in Thai children presenting with 
upper urinary tract infection, 2) the association between VUR with acute
pyelonephritis and subsequent renal scarring, 3) the use of DMSA and direct
radionuclide cystography (DRNC) scintigraphy in children with UTI. Sixty newly
diagnosed UTI children underwent DRNC and Tc-99m DMSA renal cortical scintigraphy
at the time of first UTI diagnosis and 6 months later. There were no significant 
differences of age, sex, type of antiobiotics and pathogens (E. coli vs non-E.
coli) between those who did and did not develop scars (p>0.05). 58/98 of 1st DMSA
abnormal kidneys (59.18%) developed scars. 60.20 per cent of 98 positive 1st DMSA
had VUR while 80.33 per cent of 61 with VUR had positive 1st DMSA. 59.02 per cent
of these 61 kidneys developed scars. Scar occurrence were 18.7 times in high
grade VUR compared to low grades. In conclusion, there was a high incidence of
acute pyelonephritis in the presence of VUR but acute pyelonephritis does not
necessarily need VUR for its development. High grade reflux with upper UTI, is a 
strong indicator for renal scarring. Children presenting with UTI, irrespective
of age, sex, or pathogen, should have both DMSA and DRNC scintigraphy performed
to identify upper UTI and high risk patients who will develop subsequent renal
scarring.

Lipoic acid in combination with a chelator ameliorates lead-induced peroxidative 
damages in rat kidney.

Basic Medical Sciences, University of Madras (Taramani), Chennai 600 113, India.

The deleterious effect of lead has been attributed to lead-induced oxidative
stress with the consequence of lipid peroxidation. The present study was designed
to investigate the combined effect of DL-alpha-lipoic acid (LA) and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on lead-induced peroxidative damages in
rat kidney. The increase in peroxidated lipids in lead-poisoned rats was
accompanied by alterations in antioxidant defence systems. Lead acetate (Pb,
0.2%) was administered in drinking water for 5 weeks to induce lead toxicity. LA 
(25 mg/kg body weight per day i.p.) and DMSA (20 mg/kg body weight per day i.p.) 
were administered individually and also in combination during the sixth week.
Nephrotoxic damage was evident from decreases in the activities of gamma-glutamyl
transferase and N-acetyl beta- D-glucosaminidase, which were reversed upon
combined treatment with LA and DMSA. Rats subjected to lead intoxication showed a
decline in the thiol capacity of the cell, accompanied by high malondialdehyde
levels along with lowered activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase,
glutathione peroxidase and glutathione metabolizing enzymes (glutathione
reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione- S-transferase).
Supplementation with LA as a sole agent showed considerable changes over
oxidative stress parameters. The study has highlighted the combined effect of
both drugs as being more effective in reversing oxidative damage by bringing
about an improvement in the reductive status of the cell.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common causes of unexplained
fever in neonates. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of
urinary tract anomalies and acute renal damage in neonates who presented with
first urinary tract infection in the first 8 weeks of life. We reviewed the
records of 95 infants, who were hospitalised with UTI during a 6-year period
(1994-1999). Patients with antenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis and incomplete
radiological investigations were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 57
patients, 42 were boys and 15 girls. The mean age at diagnosis was 32 days (range
5-60 days). All patients underwent renal ultrasonography (US), voiding
cystourethrogram (VCUG) and (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Urinary 
tract abnormalities were detected in 20 (35%) patients. Vesicoureteral reflux
(VUR) was found in 19 (33%) neonates, 7 girls and 12 boys. Acute cortical defects
on DMSA scan were present in 19 kidneys of patients with VUR and in 25 of those
without reflux. Only one-third of neonates after first symptomatic UTI had VUR.
We recommend that US, VCUG, and DMSA scan should be routinely performed after the
first UTI in infants younger than 8 weeks.

The pathogenesis of renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis (APN) in children
is multifactorial. In addition to well-known risk factors (young age, high grade 
of vesicoureteral reflux, P-fimbriated Escherichia coli, and treatment delay), a 
role for genetic predisposition has been suggested. Since the ACE gene deletion
polymorphism is a known risk factor for progressive glomerulosclerosis in chronic
renal diseases, we have investigated the relationship between the ACE genotypes
and the development of renal scarring after APN. Fifty-nine children (43 males
and 16 females) with APN diagnosed by urine culture and
technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99)Tc-DMSA) renal scan were studied. ACE
genotypes were determined as II, ID, and DD using the polymerase chain reaction
technique. A follow-up (99)Tc-DMSA renal scan was performed to evaluate the
development of renal scars 3-6 months after treatment. The distribution of ACE
genotypes and the allele frequencies were compared in the renal scar-positive (
n=39) and -negative group ( n=20). ACE genotype frequency after stratification by
risk factors was also evaluated. The distribution of ACE genotypes did not differ
between the renal scar-positive (II 25.9%, ID 35.9%, DD 28.2%) and -negative
group (II 35.0%, ID 45.0%, DD 20.0%), before and after stratification by each
risk factor. ACE gene deletion polymorphism did not affect the development of
renal scar as an independent variable in children with APN.

Reflux nephropathy in transplants.

Howie AJ(1), Buist LJ, Coulthard MG.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, University of Birmingham, UK.

Reflux nephropathy, renal scarring after urine infection, typically occurs in
infancy. Although vesicoureteric reflux occurs commonly in kidney allografts,
grafts have not previously been regarded as likely to be affected by reflux
nephropathy, perhaps because older kidneys are considered to have matured out of 
the risk. Evidence that adult pigs remain at risk of reflux nephropathy
challenges that assumption. We therefore reviewed the pathological findings in
allograft nephrectomy specimens to look for evidence of reflux nephropathy, and
sought evidence of focal transplant renal scarring in paediatric recipients who
had a urine infection and vesicoureteric reflux. Consecutive allograft
nephrectomy specimens (146) that had been removed between 1990 and 1999 were
examined for evidence of reflux nephropathy, and relevant case notes were
reviewed. Also, children with a renal transplant who had a urine infection were
investigated for focal scarring by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning and
for reflux with a cystogram. Four transplanted kidneys from adult donors that
were removed from adult recipients had developed changes consistent with reflux
nephropathy. Of these, 3 also had definite evidence and 1 probable evidence of a 
glomerulopathy associated with hyperfiltration due to reduced renal mass. All 4
patients had had recurrent urine infection and the 2 assessed had had
vesicoureteric reflux. Two children with renal transplants that also had urine
infections and vesicoureteric reflux to their graft were shown to have sustained 
focal damage on DMSA scan, confirmed as reflux nephropathy scarring on biopsy in 
1 case. The grafts were aged 14.4 years and over 16 years at the time of
scarring. Reflux nephropathy can occur in previously healthy adult human kidneys 
after transplantation. Previous studies of the effect of vesicoureteric reflux on
renal allografts were not designed to assess the possibility of mild or focal
scarring.

Uncommon clinical course of multiple osteochondromatosis in a patient with a
long-term history of Cushing's disease.

Cushing's disease (CD), the chronic endogenous hypercortisolism derived from an
ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma, and multiple osteochondromatosis (MO), a
congenital mesoderm dyschondroplasia, represent two distinct rare neoplastic
diseases. Clinical appearance of MO usually occurs during the first-second decade
of life. In fact, the growth of osteochondromas parallels the patient's growth,
then becoming quiescent after the closure of the epiphyses and the achievement of
final stature. Here we describe an uncommon case of a patient with a long-term
history of childhood-onset CD, who surprisingly developed MO during the third
decade of life, after the remission of CD. Indeed, a female patient had been
followed for CD from the age of 12 to the age of 24 years, when CD definitively
remitted. At the age of 26 the patient complained progressively worsening
backache and pain at level of hips and feet. Standard radiography of skeleton
showed multiple bone dysmorphisms at level of the four limbs, spine and pelvis
consistent with multiple osteochondromas and exostoses. A diagnosis of MO was
performed. Total body bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-MDP revealed an increased
uptake of the radioligand, suggesting an increased metabolic turnover in
correspondence of the majority of the osteochondromas. However, the negativity of
the majority of the lesions at 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy and the histological
diagnosis of benign osteochondroma of the only positive lesion at 99mTc-DMSA
evidenced that the high metabolic activity of the osteochondromas was not due to 
malignant transformation. However, the activity of the lesions was highly
surprising considering that they usually become quiescent after the achievement
of the final stature. In last analysis, the uncommon characteristics of MO and,
particularly, its occurrence after stable remission of hypercortisolism, suggests
a possible role of glucocorticoids in influencing the clinical course of the
skeletal disease. The inhibitory effect of hypercortisolism on bone growth and
maturation could explain the block in the proliferation of skeletal lesions
during the developmental age, where CD was in the active phase, and the opposite 
effect of stimulation of the ostochondromas growth during stable normalization of
cortisol secretion, after CD remission.

Lead induced oxidative damage and its response to combined administration of
alpha-lipoic acid and succimers in rats.

Pande M(1), Flora SJ.

Establishment, Jhansi Road, Gwalior, India.

Alpha-lipoic acid (LA) has been reported to be highly effective in improving the 
thiol capacity of the cells and in reducing lead induced oxidative stress. These 
results suggested its possible role as a therapeutic intervention of lead
poisoning in combination with a chelator. We investigated the effects of LA,
either alone or when administered in combination with succimer (meso
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid; DMSA or one of its analogue monoisoamyl DMSA), in
influencing the lead induced alterations in haem synthesis pathway, hepatic,
renal and brain oxidative stress and lead concentration from blood and soft
tissues. The results suggest a significant lead induced inhibition of
delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), reduction in glutathione (GSH) and 
an increased zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) level in blood, indicating altered heme
synthesis pathway. Both the thiol chelators were able to increase blood ALAD
activity and GSH level towards normal. The most prominent effect on blood ALAD
activity was however observed when monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA) was co-administered
with LA. Lead exposure produced significant depletion of hepatic GSH, while,
oxidized glutahione (GSSG), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and
catalase activity increased significantly, suggesting hepatic oxidative stress.
All the treatments were able to increase hepatic GSH and reduce GSSG levels,
while, TBARS level reduced significantly in animals administered LA and MiADMSA, 
individually or in combination. Lead induced increase in renal GSSG, TBARS levels
and catalase activity, were effectively reduced by LA, while, the two chelators
when administered alone were effective only in reducing GSSG and catalase
activity. The most prominent beneficial effects, however, were observed in
animals treated concomitantly with LA and one of the chelators (DMSA or MiADMSA).
Brain GSH and GSSG levels decreased moderately while superoxide dismutase (SOD)
activity remained statistically unaltered on lead exposure. Brain catalase
activity, on the other hand, increased significantly. Administration of LA was
effective in reducing these alterations in the brain, however, the best effects
were achieved in animals co-administered LA and one of the thiol chelators. The
results point to a significant beneficial role of LA in the recovery of altered
biochemical variables both during monotherapy and when given in combination with 
succimer. It however, showed no chelating properties in decreasing lead burden
from blood, liver and kidneys except for a significantly more pronounced decrease
in brain lead concentration in animals administered LA plus thiol chelators,
compared to the effects of chelating agents alone. This is an interesting and
notable observation, which requires further exploration. The results thus provide
evidence of an encouraging role of LA when given in combination with a thiol
chelator in the therapeutic intervention of lead poisoning, particularly in
reducing the oxidative stress and brain lead concentration.

The main tool of radionuclide techniques applied to paediatric uro-nephrology is 
the quantitation of function, which is an information not easily obtained by
other diagnostic modalities. The radiation burden is low. Drug sedation is only
rarely needed, whatever the age of the patient. Accurate determination of
glomerular filtration rate can be obtained by means of an intravenous injection
of Cr-51 EDTA and one or two blood samples. Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy is an
accurate method for evaluation of regional cortical impairment during acute
pyelonephritis and later on, for detection of permanent scarring. Tc-99m MAG3
renography is nowadays a well-standardized method for accurate estimation of the 
split renal function and of renal drainage with or without furosemide challenge. 
This technique is particularly indicated in uni- or bilateral uropathies with or 
without renal and/or ureteral dilatation. Direct and indirect radionuclide
cystography are two alternative modalities for X-ray MCUG. Their relative place
in the strategy of management of vesicoureteral reflux is discussed.

    Pediatr Nephrol. 2003 Jul;18(7):726.

In the absence of specific symptomatology in children, the early diagnosis of
acute pyelonephritis is a challenge, particularly during infancy. In an attempt
to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary tract infection (UTI),
we measured serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels and compared these with other
commonly used inflammatory markers. We evaluated the ability of serum PCT levels 
to predict renal involvement, as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocyte counts, and PCT levels
were measured in 64 children admitted for suspected UTI. Renal parenchymal
involvement was assessed by (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy in the first 7 days after
admission. In acute pyelonephritis, the median PCT level was significantly higher
than in the lower UTI group (3.41, range 0.36-12.4 microg/l vs. 0.13, range
0.02-2.15 microg/l, P<0.0001). In these two groups, respectively, median CRP
levels were 120 (range 62-249 mg/l) and 74.5 (range 14.5-235 mg/l, P=0.012) and
leukocyte counts were 15,910/mm(3) (range 10,200-26,900) and 14,600/mm(3) (range 
8,190-26,470, P=0.34). For the prediction of acute pyelonephritis, the
sensitivity and specificity of PCT were 94.1% and 89.7%, respectively; CRP had a 
sensitivity of 100%, but a specificity of 18.5%. We conclude that serum PCT may
be an accurate marker for early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis.

Combined administration of oxalic acid, succimer and its analogue for the
reversal of gallium arsenide-induced oxidative stress in rats.

Gallium arsenide (GaAs), a group III-VA intermetallic semiconductor, possesses
superior electronic and optical properties and has a wide application in the
electronics industry. Exposure to GaAs in the semiconductor industry is a
potential occupational hazard because cleaning and slicing GaAs ingots to yield
the desired wafer could generate GaAs particles. The ability of GaAs to induce
oxidative stress has not yet been reported. The present study reports the role of
oxidative stress in GaAs-induced haematological and liver disorders and its
possible reversal overturn by administration of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA) and one of its analogue, monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA), either individually
or in combination with oxalic acid. While DMSA and MiADMSA are potential arsenic 
chelators, oxalic acid is reported to be an effective gallium chelator. Male rats
were exposed to 10 mg/kg GaAs orally, 5 days a week for 8 weeks. GaAs exposure
was then stopped and rats were given a 0.5 mmol/kg dose of succimers (DMSA or
MiADMSA), oxalic acid or a combination of the two, intraperitoneally once daily
for 5 consecutive days. We found a significant fall in blood delta-aminolevulinic
acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity and blood glutathione (GSH) level, and an
increased urinary excretion of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and an increased
malondialdehyde (MDA) level in erythrocytes of rats exposed to GaAs. Hepatic GSH 
levels decreased, whereas there was an increase in GSSG and MDA levels. The
results suggest a role of oxidative stress in GaAs-induced haematological and
hepatic damage. Administration of DMSA and MiADMSA produced effective recovery in
most of the above variables. However, a greater effectiveness of the chelation
treatment (i.e. removal of both gallium and arsenic from body organs) could be
achieved by combined administration of succimer (DMSA) with oxalic acid since,
after MiADMSA administration, a marked loss of essential metals (copper and zinc)
is of concern.

Percutaneous direct radionuclide cystography in children: description of
technique and early experience.

Wilkinson AG(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Sciennes Road,
Edinburgh EH9 1LF, UK.

AIMS: To describe a new test for vesicoureteric reflux in children and assess
patient preference compared to indirect radionuclide cystography.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and three toilet-trained children aged between
2.1 and 15.6 years underwent percutaneous injection of 10-20 MBq of
99m-technetium-labelled mercapto-acetyl-triglycine (MAG3) into the full bladder
after the application of anaesthetic cream. Gamma camera images of the bladder
and renal areas were recorded during a 5-min resting period and during
micturition.
RESULTS: All procedures were successful, 97 with a single stab. Fifty-four of the
66 children who expressed a preference preferred percutaneous suprapubic
injection to intravenous injection. Images were easy to interpret and there were 
no indeterminate results. Of 200 renal units, 33 refluxed during the resting
phase and 31 during micturition. In 24 renal units, reflux was only demonstrated 
during the resting phase. Reflux was significantly associated with abnormalities 
on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans ( P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The new technique of direct percutaneous radionuclide cystography is
described. It was well tolerated by patients. It detects reflux during the
resting phase that would be missed on the indirect study and avoids doubt as to
whether activity in the renal areas is due to reflux or excretion. Free
pertechnetate could be used and would be much cheaper.

Different radiopharmaceuticals have been used to detect breast cancer. Among
them, sestamibi has been extensively studied and has come to have a
well-recognized role in the evaluation of palpable breast lesions. The goal of
this study was to compare the diagnostic value of 99mTc-labeled compounds, such
as methylene diphosphonate (MDP) and pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA-V), with sestamibi for palpable breast lesions, in the scope of a
multicenter trial sponsored by the International Atomic Energy Agency.METHODS:
Patients from 7 countries were included: 47 women (mean age, 54 +/- 13 y)
examined with MDP and sestamibi and 111 women (mean age, 55 +/- 12 y) examined
with DMSA-V and sestamibi. Cancer was diagnosed in 41 of 49 lesions from the MDP 
group and in 78 of 113 lesions from the DMSA-V group. Axillary lymph node
involvement was observed in 18 of 30 patients from the first group and in 27 of
53 patients from the second group. Prone scintimammography was performed using a 
dose of 740 MBq of each tracer, and diagnostic values were calculated from a
masked interpretation of scans.
RESULTS: In the first group, the sensitivity for sestamibi and MDP studies was
82.9% and 65.9%, respectively, with a specificity of 87.5% and 50%, respectively.
In the second group, the sensitivity for sestamibi and DMSA-V studies was 87.2%
and 65.4%, respectively, with a specificity of 77.1% and 74.3%, respectively.
Regarding axillary involvement, the sensitivity was 33.3% for sestamibi in both
groups, whereas the values for MDP and DMSA-V were 16.7% and 7.4%, respectively. 
In contrast, the specificity for sestamibi was 83.3% and 92.3% for the first and 
second groups, respectively, and the specificity for MDP and DMSA-V was 91.7% and
100%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Sestamibi is the most adequate alternative among the mentioned
99mTc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals for the evaluation of palpable breast lesions.

[Influence of selected factors on the development of renal scars in children with

Although relationship between vesico-ureteric reflux, urinary tract infection and
renal scarring is known, pathogenesis of the renal scarring is still unclear.
Vesico-ureteric reflux and urinary tract infection remain in very close
relationship, they may also occur separately. The factor promoting renal injury
is also young age of a child. The aim of this paper was to analyse the influence 
of the selected factors, namely: degree of the vesico-ureteric reflux; child's
age at reflux diagnosis time as well as the frequency of recurrences of urinary
tract infections exerted on reflux nephropathy. In 45 children with diagnosed
vesicoureteric reflux the intensity of renal scarring was estimated using planar 
scintigraphy with DMSA-Tc-99m and a questionnaire was prepared. The questionnaire
included information as follows: age at which the diagnosis was established,
degree of reflux at the time of diagnosis, treatment applied, frequency of
urinary tract infections before and after having taking medical care of children.
It was revealed that the degree of scarring correlated with degree of
vesico-ureteric reflux of particular kidney. In the investigated group no
correlations were found between intensity of renal scarring and both the age of
establishing diagnosis and frequency of urinary tract infections before starting 
the treatment. Taking the obtained results into consideration it seems, that the 
degree of vesico-ureteric reflux estimated prior to treatment determines degree
of renal injuries though, undoubtedly all factors being studied affect renal
scarring.

The effect of meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and monoisoamyl DMSA
(MiADMSA) on gallium arsenide (GaAs) induced liver damage was studied. The oral
feeding rat model was used in this study. The animals were exposed to 10 mg/kg
GaAs, orally, once daily, 5 days a week for 24 weeks and treated thereafter with 
single oral daily dose of either 0.3 mmol/kg DMSA or MiADMSA for two course of 5 
days treatment. The animals were sacrificed thereafter. Lipid peroxidation was
assessed by measuring liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS). Liver
damage was assessed by number of biochemical variables and by light microscopy.
The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and delta-aminolevulinic acid
dehydratase (ALAD) beside reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration was measured in
blood. Exposure to GaAs produced a significant reduction in GSH while, increased 
the oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentration. Hepatic glutathione peroxidase
(GPx) and catalase activity increased significantly while level of serum
transaminase increased moderately. Gallium arsenide exposure also produced marked
hepatic histopathological lesions. Overall, treatment with MiADMSA proved to be
better than DMSA in the mobilization of arsenic and in the turnover of some of
the above mentioned GaAs sensitive biochemical alterations. Histopathological
lesions also, responded more favorably to chelation treatment with MiADMSA than
DMSA.

Oxygen and nitrate-dependent regulation of dmsABC operon expression in
Escherichia coli: sites for Fnr and NarL protein interactions.

Bearson SM(1), Albrecht JA, Gunsalus RP.

(1)Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, and the
Molecular Biology Institute, 1602 Molecular Sciences Building, University of
California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. robg@microbio.ucla.edu

BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli, can respire anaerobically using dimethyl sulfoxide 
(DMSO) or trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) as the terminal electron acceptor for
anaerobic energy generation. Expression of the dmsABC genes that encode the
membrane-associated DMSO/TMAO reductase is positively regulated during anaerobic 
conditions by the Fnr protein and negatively regulated by the NarL protein when
nitrate is present.
RESULTS: The regions of dmsA regulatory DNA required for Fnr and NarL
interactions in response to anaerobiosis and nitrate, respectively, were
examined. Mutations within the Fnr site that deviated from the wild type
sequence, TTGATaccgAACAA, or that removed an entire half-site, either impaired or
abolished the anaerobic activation of dmsA-lacZ expression. The region for
phosphorylated NarL (NarL-phosphate) binding at the dmsA promoter was identified 
by DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting methods. A large 97 bp region that
overlaps the Fnr and RNA polymerase recognition sites was protected by
NarL-phosphate but not by the non-phosphorylated form of NarL. Hydroxyl radical
footprinting analysis confirmed the NarL-phosphate DNase I protections of both
dmsA strands and revealed 8-9 protected sites of 3-5 bp occurring at ten bp
intervals that are offset by 3 bp in the 3' direction.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that multiple molecules of phosphorylated NarL
bind along one face of the DNA and may interfere with Fnr and/or RNA polymerase
interactions at the dmsA regulatory region. The interplay of these transcription 
factors insures a hierarchical expression of the dmsABC genes when respiration of
the preferred electron acceptors, oxygen and nitrate, is not possible.

(99m)Technetium pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy in the follow-up
of clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas after radiotherapy.

Colao A(1), Ferone D, Lombardi G, Lastoria S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Clinical and Molecular Endocrinology and Oncology, University
Federico II of Naples, Italy. colao@unina.it

BACKGROUND: It is still difficult to differentiate pituitary adenoma remnants
from postradiotherapy fibrosis by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), especially in patients with clinically nonfunctioning pituitary
adenomas (NFA), lacking circulating markers to follow disease progression or
cure.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the usefulness of scintigraphy with technetium-99m
pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid [(99m)Tc(V)DMSA], shown previously to detect 
most pituitary GH- and PRL-secreting adenomas and NFA, with tumour-to-background 
ratios (T/B) as high as 25-fold.
PATIENTS: Eighteen patients with NFA (study group), 10 patients with GH- and
three patients with PRL-secreting adenomas (control group), all of whom had
undergone previous surgery.
DESIGN: The study was an open longitudinal design. Pituitary CT/MRI and
(99m)Tc(V)DMSA scintigraphy was performed before and 1, 3 and 5 years after
conventional radiotherapy. Tumour size was measured as maximal diameter of the
residual lesion, while uptake of (99m)Tc(V)DMSA was measured as a T/B ratio.
RESULTS: At study entry, pituitary (99m)Tc(V)DMSA uptake was found in 13 NFA
(72.2%), seven GH-secreting (70%) and all PRL-secreting adenomas; remnant tumour 
was documented by CT/MRI in all 31 patients. Maximal remnant diameter was
significantly higher in patients with positive (13.3 +/- 0.9 mm) than in those
with negative scintigraphy (7.0 +/- 0.3 mm, P < 0.001). During the 5-year
follow-up postradiotherapy, a significant decrease in (99m)Tc(V)DMSA uptake (9.7 
+/- 0.8 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.5, P < 0.0001) occurred in all but three patients. Two NFA 
patients died of tumour invasion 19 and 36 months after radiotherapy and one
acromegalic patient had no change in his hormone levels. In the eight negative
patients (five NFA and three GH), scintigraphy remained negative throughout
follow-up. A remarkable shrinkage of the remnant tumour was observed in both the 
patients with negative (from 7.0 +/- 0.3 to 1.9 +/- 0.6 mm, P < 0.001) and in
those with positive scintigraphy (from 13.3 +/- 0.9 to 7.3 +/- 0.6 mm, P <
0.001). At the end of the study, CT/MRI showed evident remnant tumour in 13 of 16
NFA (81.2%), nine GH-secreting (90%) and all three prolactinomas (100%), while
the scintigraphy was negative (T/B < 1) or faintly positive (T/B 1-2) in eight of
16 NFA (50%), five GH-secreting (50%) and one prolactinoma (33.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Functional imaging of pituitary remnant adenomas (> 10 mm in size)
by (99m)Tc(V)DMSA depicts viable pituitary adenoma remnants. This approach may be
of clinical value in patients with clinically nonfunctioning adenomas to monitor 
the effects of radiotherapy.

The paper presents a short historical outline and contemporary use of
scintigraphic studies of thyroid gland. Appropriate recommendations and correct
interpretations of the results of routine thyroid scans and the usefulness of
other scintigraphic studies with 111In-octreoscan, 99mTc-MIBI, 99mTc-DMSA, 18FDG 
and radiolabeled monoclonal anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibodies were
discussed in the light of the present thyroid diagnostic studies. Particular
attention was paid to the dependence of the scintigraphic thyroid images upon the
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level in the patient's serum. The chosen
examples of scintigraphic studies show the advantages of scintigraphic evaluation
of efficacy of radioiodine therapy. The most often mistakes of the scintigraphy
interpretations were showed.

99mTc-labeled field bean protease inhibitor can function as an efficient tumor
detecting agent.

Purified field bean protease inhibitor (FBPI) was labeled with 99mTcO4- to
ascertain its ability to locate tumors in tumor-bearing rat models. The labeling 
was done with Sn2+ as a reducing agent and the yield was 95%. It was stable for 2
hr at ambient temperature. The biodistribution study of the intravenously
injected radiolabeled FBPI in normal Wistar rats at various time intervals showed
a rapid blood clearance from the systemic circulation (approximately 5hr). The
complex was predominantly excreted through the renal and the hepatobiliary
systems. In vivo distribution and scintiimaging of 99mTc-FBPI were carried out in
rats bearing carcinogen-induced mammary tumor or transplanted C6-gliomas. The
results obtained were compared with conventional tumor-seeking
radiopharmaceuticals such as 99mTc-(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 201Thallous
chloride (TICI) and 99mTc-Citrate. The tumor to muscle (T/M) ratios obtained with
99mTc-FBPI in rat C6 glioma was nearly 2 to 5-fold higher than obtained with all 
the three conventional tumor-seeking agents. The T/M ratio obtained with
99mTc-FBPI in rat mammary tumor on the other hand appeared to be 2-3-fold higher 
than noted with 99mTc(V)-DMSA and 201TlCl. The ratio was however comparable with 
that obtained with 99mTc-Citrate. The study indicated that 99mTc-FBPI has the
specific potentials for imaging gliomas and possibly other tumors as well.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of pyonephrosis in a child with special reference
to the importance of scintigraphy in its evaluation.
METHODS: We studied the correlation of the findings of conventional radiology
(abdominal x-ray), ultrasound, abdominal CT, scintigraphy and anatomopathology
(left kidney) in a 5-year-old boy with a history of renal lithiasis that was seen
at our pediatric emergency services. The patient's clinical course and the
scinscan findings using two tracers (Tc-99m DMSA, Ga-67 citrate) showed a
severely compromised left renal function. The foregoing finding and the risk of
major life-threatening complications prompted surgical treatment. Pathological
analysis showed pyonephrosis of left kidney.
RESULTS: X-ray, ultrasound and abdominal CT showed left renal lithiasis, an
enlarged left kidney, poor cortico-medullary differentiation and parenchymal
destructuring with areas suggestive of cortical abscesses. A Ga-67 citrate
scintiscan showed a notable intensity that completely affected the left renal
parenchyma with no other changes. On the other hand, Tc-99m DMSA showed no uptake
in the left kidney and normal uptake in the right kidney. A left nephrectomy was 
performed. Histological analysis demonstrated pyonephrosis of left kidney.
CONCLUSIONS: Tc-99m DMSA and Ga-67 citrate scintigraphy and the patient's poor
clinical course showed the extent and severity of the underlying condition that
was underestimated by the other imaging techniques.

We used (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) quantitative SPECT (QDMSA) to
assess the function of kidneys before harvesting and after transplantation as
well as the function of remaining donor kidneys.METHODS: Nineteen kidney donors
underwent a baseline QDMSA study before nephrectomy. The allografts of these
kidneys were studied in recipients at 1 wk, 1-2 mo, and 6-15 mo after
transplantation. The kidneys remaining in 16 donors were studied at 1-2 mo and
6-15 mo after harvesting. The parameters obtained in each SPECT study included
functional volume, concentration of (99m)Tc-DMSA per cubic centimeter of renal
tissue, and total kidney uptake. Clinical evaluation and determination of serum
creatinine levels took place at the same time as SPECT.
RESULTS: On the basis of the clinical evaluation, 14 grafts had normal function
and 5 were impaired. The mean +/- SD of kidney uptake values expressed as
percentage of baseline values were 131% +/- 30% in normal grafts versus 57% +/-
5% in impaired grafts at 1 wk (P < 0.01), 173% +/- 57% versus 65% +/- 10% at 1-2 
mo (P < 0.001), and 190% +/- 50% versus 69% +/- 14% at 6-15 mo after
transplantation (P < 0.01). Uptake values in the donors' remaining kidneys were
159% +/- 27% of baseline values at 1-2 mo and 164% +/- 30% at 6-15 mo after
nephrectomy. Allografts and remaining kidneys showed a similar increase in total 
kidney uptake as a result of an increase in both functional volume and
concentration.
CONCLUSION: QDMSA may be a noninvasive assessment tool in kidney transplantation 
from living donors.

This study was performed to investigate the relationship between histological
type and grade, with the uptake and washout of
99mTc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-sestamibi, 99mTc-MIBI) and
99mTcV-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTcV-DMSA) in breast cancer. Forty-five
patients with histologically proven breast cancer had previously been referred
for 99mTcV-DMSA and/or 99mTc-MIBI scintimammography. Twenty-five of them
underwent both 99mTcV-DMSA and 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy in a double phase study.
Lateral prone and anterior supine images were acquired at 15 and 60 min after
administration of 740-925 MBq of each radiotracer. Uptake ratios and retention
index were calculated and correlated with histology and grade of malignancy.
Histology showed eight different histotypes: 77.7% were infiltrating ductal or
lobular carcinomas. Mammography was definitely positive in 32/45, indeterminate
in 10 and negative in three cases (sensitivity 71%). 99mTcV-DMSA was true
positive in 37/40 (sensitivity 92.5%) and 99mTc-MIBI in 28/30 (sensitivity 93.3%)
breast cancers. Uptake ratios were significantly higher in ductal than in lobular
carcinomas on 99mTcV-DMSA and 99mTc-MIBI scintigrams at early and delayed phases.
Grade II carcinomas had significantly lower values of retention index (rapid
washout) than grade III carcinomas. This finding was statistically significant
only on 99mTc-MIBI scans and was observed in ductal and lobular carcinomas. The
retention index did not show any significant difference between ductal and
lobular carcinomas. Uptake ratios were also not statistically different between
grade II and III cancers. It is concluded that 99mTc-MIBI and 99mTcV-DMSA uptake 
in breast cancer is probably related to histological type and may distinguish
ductal from lobular carcinomas. To a certain degree, the washout rate may reflect
the histological grade, but since grade is not the only factor influencing this
phenomenon it should be explored further in conjunction with other parameters by 
multivariate analysis in order to clarify eventual indirect correlations.

Radiolabeled peptides in diagnosis and tumor imaging: clinical overview.

Warner RR(1), O'dorisio TM.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, The Mount Sinai School
of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA.

The authors briefly review radiopeptides currently approved for use in the United
States. They present a short review of the peptide somatostatin's actions and
also note the five somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) to which the peptide and its
synthetic analogs octreotide, lanreotide, and vapreotide bind. The many
conditions besides neuroendocrine tumors having SSTRs are listed. Labeled
octreotide and the other two analogues have a strong affinity for SSTR2 and
SSTR5, which thereby produce positive imaging. The various neuroendocrine tumors 
best imaged by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) are discussed, and the
exceptions (insulinoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma) are noted to be seen
better with labeled VIP and (99m)Tc-dimethylsuccinic acid (DMSA), respectively.
SRS and VIP receptor scintigraphy are also noted to image many nonneuroendocrine 
tumors, which often have appropriate receptors. Several of the currently emerging
and very effective new imaging techniques are described. These include
(99m)Tc-DMSA for medullary thyroid carcinoma, (18)F dihydroxyphenylalanine
positron emission tomography, and C(11) 5-hydroxytryptophan positron emission
tomography scanning for all neuroendocrine tumor, but especially carcinoid tumor,
metastases. The special role of SRS in identifying gastric carcinoid tumors in
hypergastrinemic patients is reviewed. Various pitfalls in interpreting SRS are
presented and receptor-enhancing techniques described. Besides use of SRS (mainly
Octreoscan, Mallinckrodt Medical, St. Louis, MO) only for detecting and
localizing primary tumors and metastases for staging, there are many additional
special uses for clinical management of SRS-positive tumors. These include the
intraoperative use of the handheld gamma-detecting probe. A brief enumeration is 
given of the most promising of other non-SST G-protein-coupled receptors and
ligands currently under development. Finally, we have posed a number of questions
for which answers are needed in the immediate future to facilitate better
imaging. Extrapolations of current knowledge and experience with radiolabeled
peptide pharmaceutical imaging are converted to reasonable speculations of
anticipated future developments in this field.

The role of DMSA scans in evaluation of the correlation between urinary tract
infection, vesicoureteric reflux, and renal scarring.

Delhi-110029, India.

The correlation between urinary tract infection (UTI), vesicoureteric reflux
(VUR) and renal scarring was studied in 89 patients (177 renal units; 1 solitary 
kidney) during the period 1997-2000. There were 63 males and 26 females; ages
ranged from neonates to 14 years. UTI was diagnosed on the basis of a positive
urine culture, VUR was diagnosed and graded by micturating cystourethrogram
(MCU), and renal scarring was assessed by technetium 99 m Tc-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) scan. Ultrasonography (US) was done to evaluate renal tract
dilatation and other structural abnormalities. A follow up DMSA scan was
performed approximately 6 months after the initial scan. VUR was present in 106
of the 171 renal units in which it was studied and absent in 65 units. The
majority of the VUR was grade V. Renal scars were seen in 90 of 177 renal units
at presentation and in 72 of the 163 renal units studied at follow-up. Some
information was lacking in 31 patients; hence, the correlation between UTI, VUR, 
and renal scarring was done in 58 patients. The majority of the suspected scars
at presentation were not seen at follow-up, but most of the established scars
persisted. Only 2 renal units showed scars for the first time on follow-up. On
US, approximately 50% of normal kidneys showed either suspicious or established
scars on DMSA scan, and patients with bilateral abnormality on US showed renal
scars. Renal scars were seen in 15 of 23 children without VUR, 17 of 18 with
unilateral VUR, and 16 of 17 with bilateral VUR. Thus, there is a
cause-and-effect relationship between UTI and renal scarring that is made worse
by VUR. DMSA scans have been shown to be the most reliable method of assessing
renal scarring, and an abnormal US scan showing upper-tract dilatation or a
structural abnormality may have a predictive value in the detection of renal
scarring.

Ultrasound grade of hydronephrosis and severity of renal cortical damage on 99m
technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan in infants with unilateral
hydronephrosis during followup and after pyeloplasty.

Konda R(1), Sakai K, Ota S, Abe Y, Hatakeyama T, Orikasa S.

PURPOSE: We performed ultrasonography and (99m)technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) renal scan in infants with unilateral hydronephrosis during followup and
after pyeloplasty to examine the correlation of ultrasound hydronephrosis grade
with the severity of renal cortical damage and assess the recovery of renal
function in the obstructed kidneys after surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 80 boys and 19 girls with unilateral
hydronephrosis detected in the first year of life, including 75 (76%) in whom it 
was detected prenatally. Ultrasound images were graded according to the Society
for Fetal Urology grading system. The severity of renal cortical damage was
assessed by DMSA renal scan. Absolute function of the right and left kidneys was 
estimated by DMSA uptake and relative DMSA uptake was calculated by the formula, 
relative uptake = uptake in obstructed kidney/total uptake in right and left
kidneys x 100%.
RESULTS: On ultrasonography grades 1 to 4 hydronephrosis were diagnosed in 9, 21,
19 and 50 kidneys, respectively. On DMSA renal scan cortical damage was detected 
in 10 kidneys (53%) with grade 3 and 49 (98%) with grade 4 hydronephrosis but not
in kidneys with grade 1 or 2 disease. Dysfunction in the obstructed kidney,
defined as relative DMSA uptake less than 40%, was noted in 13 patients with
grade 4 hydronephrosis. Relative DMSA uptake significantly increased after
successful pyeloplasty compared with preoperative uptake (44% +/- 2% versus 40.1%
+/- 2%, p <0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound grading of hydronephrosis correlates with the severity of
cortical damage or the decrease in renal function on DMSA renal scan.
Differential renal function on DMSA renal scan may be a useful and less invasive 
tool for determining surgical indications and examining changes in renal function
after surgery.

The value of radionuclide studies in children with autosomal recessive polycystic
kidney disease.

Zagar I(1), Anderson PJ, Gordon I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Trust,
London, United Kingdom.

PURPOSE: To describe and analyze the appearances of autosomal recessive
polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) on Tc-99m DMSA and Tc-99m HIDA scintigraphy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors evaluated scintigraphic findings for 13 boys
and 9 girls (age range, 2 months to 22.75 years; mean, 7.5 years) with ARPKD.
Fourteen children underwent Tc-99m DMSA and 20 underwent Tc-99m HIDA scintigraphy
according to European guidelines. Kidney outline, internal structure, tracer
uptake, and differential function were analyzed on Tc-99m DMSA images, whereas
relative liver lobe sizes, hepatocyte tracer uptake, time to peak, and excretion 
into the biliary tree and gut were evaluated on Tc-99m HIDA scans.
RESULTS: On Tc-99m DMSA images, loss of kidney outline and internal structure was
seen in 75% of the scans, and patchy tracer uptake with focal defects throughout 
the kidneys, particularly at the poles, was evident in 93%. In 85% of the cases, 
the Tc-99m DMSA changes did not correlate with the ultrasonographic findings
where the kidneys are uniformly affected. Characteristic findings on Tc-99m HIDA 
scans were enlarged left liver lobe in 80%, a delay in maximal hepatocyte uptake 
in 68%, delayed tracer excretion into the biliary tree in 32% (with stasis in the
prominent intrahepatic biliary ducts in 50% or pooling into the segmentally
dilated biliary ducts in 25%), and delayed excretion into the gut in 40% of
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In a child with clinically enlarged kidneys that appear diffusely
hyperechoic on ultrasound, the appearances on Tc-99m DMSA imaging strongly
support the diagnosis of ARPKD. The Tc-99m HIDA findings, especially of an
enlarged left lobe of the liver with bile stasis or dilatation, further support
the diagnosis.

99mTc(V)-DMSA scintigraphy in monitoring the response of bone disease to vitamin 
D3 therapy in renal osteodystrophy.

Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) is a common and serious complication for uremic
patients and patients are treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The bone
scanning agent 99mTc-phosphate has also been used to evaluate in ROD but it is
not clear that bone scintigraphy has a role in the follow-up of treatment. In
this study 99mTc(V)-DMSA scintigraphy was performed in eleven patients [age 40.7 
+/- 17.3 (mean +/- SD) yr] with ROD before and after vitamin D3 therapy. Images
were obtained after hemodialysis performed following tracer injection to maintain
normal blood levels of the radiopharmaceutical and to reduce soft tissue
activity. Lumbar vertebra-to-soft tissue uptake ratios (LUR) were quantified with
the planar 99mTc(V)-DMSA images. Alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone
levels after treatment had significantly decreased compared with pre-therapy. In 
all patients there was visually decreased uptake in bone structures after
treatment. After treatment the mean LUR ratio was significantly lower than those 
of before treatment (3.59 +/- 2.63 vs. 1.65 +/- 0.62; p = 0.01). LUR values were 
correlated with pre-therapy alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone. These
findings indicate that 99mTc(V)-DMSA scintigraphy is sensitive in evaluating the 
response of ROD to vitamin D3 therapy.

analysis.

We developed a new method for measuring the rate of renal uptake of
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) using spectral analysis. The renal uptake
rate (per minute) of DMSA (K) was calculated by averaging the tissue impulse
response function values obtained by spectral analysis between 10 min and 15 min.
The K values obtained by spectral analysis correlated well with the renal uptake 
rates (%) measured 2h after DMSA administration (r=0.921 with background
correction; r=0.924 without background correction). There was a good agreement
between the K values obtained by spectral analysis using the kidney time-activity
curves with (x) and without (y) background correction (r=0.993, y=1.089x+0.004), 
suggesting that our method requires no background correction. There was excellent
correlation between the K values obtained by spectral analysis using the kidney
time-activity curves with (y) and without (x) kidney depth correction (r=0.992,
y=1.721x+0.000 with background correction; r=0.990, y=1.720x+0.000 without
background correction), suggesting that our method requires no kidney depth
correction. These results indicate that spectral analysis is appropriate and
useful for the quantification of renal uptake rate of DMSA. We believe that this 
method will facilitate even more widespread utilization of the quantitative
assessment of DMSA uptake by planar scintigraphy, since it needs only 10-15 min
for imaging, and background and kidney depth correction and blood sampling are
not required.

Greater reliability of neonatal ultrasonography in defining renal hypoplasia with
antenatal hydronephrosis and vesicoureteral reflux.

Farhat W(1), McLorie G, Bagli D, Khoury A.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Urology, The Hospital For Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

PURPOSE: Infants with history of antenatal hydronephrosis and neonatal
vesicoureteral reflux may have detectable changes in renal scans before the
advent of urinary tract infection. In cases of bilateral high-grade
vesicoureteral reflux, differential renal function on renal scan may not reveal
renal hypoplasia since comparison of relative function may be made between two
abnormal kidneys. We tested the hypothesis that ultrasonography in the neonatal
period may be accurate and complementary to renal scan in detecting renal
hypoplasia at birth.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six infants who presented in the antenatal period
with history of hydronephrosis and were noted to have neonatal vesicoureteral
reflux postnatally were studied retrospectively. They had all been treated by a
prospective protocol that included renal ultrasound and renal scans in the first 
6 weeks of life. All had been placed on prophylactic antibiotics and had no
urinary tract infection. Multiple sonographic parameters were analyzed including 
kidney length, echogenicity, calyceal blunting, parenchymal thinning and focal
scars. We correlated the renal morphology on ultrasound, the renal function on
renal scan and the degree of reflux seen on VCUG.
RESULTS: VCUG showed reflux in 44 renal units, grade of reflux was: I (2), II
(7), III (12), IV (8), and V (15). A variety of nucleides were used including
DMSA in 15, DTPA in 6 and MAGIII in 5. Renal scans identified global hypoplasia
without focal scars (differential function less than 40%) in 10 of 44 refluxing
renal units grades I (1), III (2), IV (4), and V (3). The sonographic finding of 
decreased renal length (<50th percentile for age) was present in 14 refluxing
units of 44 refluxing renal units, grade I (1), grade III (4 bilaterally in 1),
grade IV (4 bilaterally in 1), and grade V (5 bilaterally in 2). The sonographic 
finding of decreased renal length (<50th percentile) correlated strongly with
renal hypoplasia on renal scans in refluxing renal units (p value <.005,
sensitivity 80% and specificity 82%, positive predictive value 57%, and negative 
predictive value 93%).
CONCLUSION: Postnatal ultrasonography is a reliable measure of gross renal
parenchyma, and in the presence of vesicoureteral reflux correlates with renal
scintilligraphy. In addition, for cases of bilateral neonatal vesicoureteral
reflux, ultrasound and renal scan are complimentary, each being able to detect
the abnormalities that might be missed by the other.

Effect of dithiol chelating agents on [3H]MK-801 and [3H]glutamate binding to
synaptic plasma membranes.

Nogueira CW(1), Rocha JB, Souza DO.

Federal de Santa Maria, RS, Brasil. criswn@quimica.ufsm.br

2,3-Dimercaptopropanol (BAL- British Anti-Lewesite) is a dithiol chelating agent 
used for the treatment of heavy metal poisoning, however, BAL can produce
neurotoxic effects in a variety of situations. Based on the low therapeutic
efficiency of BAL other dithiols were developed and DMSA
(meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) and DMPS (2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic
acid) are becoming used for treatments of humans exposed to heavy metals. In the 
present investigation the effect of dithiols in the glutamatergic system was
examined. The results showed that BAL inhibited [3H]MK-801 and [3H]glutamate
binding in a concentration-dependent manner. At 100 microM BAL and DMSA caused a 
significantly inhibition of [3H]MK-801 binding to brain membranes (p < 0.05 by
Duncan's multiple range test). BAL at 100 microM caused an inhibition of 40% on
[3H]glutamate binding. DMPS and DMSA had no significant effect on [3H]glutamate
binding. Dithiotreitol (DTT), abolished the inhibitory effect of BAL on
[3H]MK-801 binding. The protection exerted by DTT suggests that BAL inhibit
[3H]MK-801 binding by interacting with cysteinyl residues that are important for 
redox modulation of receptor responses. ZnCl2 inhibited [3H]glutamate and
[3H]MK-801 binding to brain synaptic membrane; nevertheless, the inhibitory
effect was slight more accentuated for [3H]MK-801 than [3H]glutamate binding (p <
0.05). The inhibition caused by 10 microM ZnCl2 on [3H]MK-801 binding was
attenuated by BAL. The findings present in this study may provide the evidence
that BAL affect the glutamatergic system and these effects can contributed to
explain, at least in part, why BAL, in contrast to DMPS and DMSA is neurotoxic.

BACKGROUND: Over the past years we have seen several children with serious
bacterial infections in whom the focus of the infection was found in the kidneys 
despite of normal or minimal urine findings.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We review the cases of all children hospitalised at our
paediatric department from 1995-2000 with normal or minimal urine findings, and
in whom acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed by means of computerized tomographic
imaging of the kidneys.
RESULTS: All 10 children (aged 9 months to 9 years) had focal areas of decreased 
enhancement in the kidney parenchyma. All received intravenous antibiotic
treatment. Vesicouretheral reflux was detected in four patients and required
surgical intervention in one. One patient had considerable renal scarring and
decreased renal function on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.
INTERPRETATION: In children with suspected serious bacterial infection, it is
important to have the possibility of renal infection in mind in spite of normal
urine findings. The importance of establishing the right diagnosis lies in the
fact that patients with pyelonephritis need further investigation and follow-up.

Chronic arsenic poisoning.

Hall AH(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Emergency Medicine, Division of Toxicology, Texas Tech
University Health Sciences Center-El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA. ahall@elp.rr.com

Symptomatic arsenic poisoning is not often seen in occupational exposure
settings. Attempted homicide and deliberate long-term poisoning have resulted in 
chronic toxicity. Skin pigmentation changes, palmar and plantar hyperkeratoses,
gastrointestinal symptoms, anemia, and liver disease are common. Noncirrhotic
portal hypertension with bleeding esophageal varices, splenomegaly, and
hypersplenism may occur. A metallic taste, gastrointestinal disturbances, and
Mee's lines may be seen. Bone marrow depression is common. 'Blackfoot disease'
has been associated with arsenic-contaminated drinking water in Taiwan; Raynaud's
phenomenon and acrocyanosis also may occur. Large numbers of persons in areas of 
India, Pakistan, and several other countries have been chronically poisoned from 
naturally occurring arsenic in ground water. Toxic delirium and encephalopathy
can be present. CCA-treated wood (chromated copper arsenate) is not a health risk
unless burned in fireplaces or woodstoves. Peripheral neuropathy may also occur. 
Workplace exposure or chronic ingestion of arsenic-contaminated water or
arsenical medications is associated with development of skin, lung, and other
cancers. Treatment may incklude the use of chelating agents such as dimercaprol
(BAL), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), and dimercaptopanesulfonic acid (DMPS).

[Power Doppler sonography and acute pyelonephritis in children: comparison with
Tc-DMSA scintigraphy].

Oscar-Lambret 59037 Lille, France.

Acute pyelonephritis is a common infection in children. The clinical and
biological diagnosis is still sometimes difficult. For most authors, Technecium
99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy is considered as the gold standard tool 
for diagnosis but it is invasive and expensive. The aim of our study was to
compare the sensitivity and the specificity of B-mode sonography and power
doppler to DMSA-Tc scintigraphy in acute pyelonephritis.PATIENTS AND METHODS:
Forty-nine children were enrolled in this study with suspicion of pyelonephritis.
All infants underwent doppler sonography and scintigraphy within 48 hours after
their hospitalization. Doppler sonography criteria were increased kidney size,
thickness of sinus wall, vascular defect, and various echogenicity of the kidneys
(focal or diffuse hyperechogenicity or focal hypoechogenicity).
RESULTS: Among 28 children with a positive scintigraphy, 15 had a positive
doppler sonography (sensitivity 54%) and 13 had a negative doppler sonography.
Among 21 children with a negative scintigraphy, 20 had a negative doppler
sonography (specificity 95%) and one had a positive doppler sonography.
CONCLUSION: In clinically suspected acute pyelonephritis, doppler sonography has 
a high specificity. A positive doppler sonography should avoid the use of
scintigraphy.

Plasma and urinary soluble adhesion molecule expression is increased during first
documented acute pyelonephritis.

(1)Department of Nephrology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Pendlebury,
Manchester M27 4HA, UK.

BACKGROUND: The degree of inflammatory reaction and leucocyte trafficking during 
acute pyelonephritis has been related to the risk of developing renal parenchymal
scarring. Adhesion molecules play a central role in leucocyte recruitment during 
inflammation.
AIMS: (1) To determine whether circulating and urinary concentrations of
E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) were abnormal during
first documented acute pyelonephritis; (2) to investigate whether circulating or 
urinary concentrations were predictive for the development of abnormalities on
DMSA imaging.
METHODS: Plasma and urine samples were collected from 40 children with a first
episode of acute pyelonephritis within one week of infection (acute sample) and
at six weeks (late sample). Control samples were collected from 21 healthy age
matched controls and 18 age matched controls with febrile illness not secondary
to urinary tract infection.
RESULTS: Plasma and urinary sE-selectin were higher in acute samples (median
176.3 ng/ml and 0.12 ng/mmol respectively) compared with late (97.8 ng/ml and
0.029 ng/mmol) and both control (65.6 ng/ml and 0 ng/mmol) and febrile control
(urine 0 ng/mmol) samples. Plasma sICAM-1 was higher in acute samples (428 ng/ml)
than controls (365.2 ng/ml), and acute sICAM-1 urine concentrations were higher
than febrile control concentrations (3.2 v 0.7 ng/mmol). No correlations were
detected between sE-selectin or sICAM-1 and acute or late DMSA scan changes.
CONCLUSION: Plasma and urinary sE-selectin and sICAM-1 are significantly
increased during acute pyelonephritis, though no correlation exists between the
presence of high plasma or urine concentrations and DMSA scan changes, both
during acute infection and six weeks post-infection.

Ectopic ureteroceles in infants with prenatal hydronephrosis: use of renal
cortical scintigraphy.

Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.

PURPOSE: This study assesses the contribution of renal cortical scintigraphy in
the diagnostic evaluation of infants with ectopic ureteroceles.
METHODS: The records of 20 infants (age range, 3 weeks to 4 months) who were
referred for renal cortical scintigraphy after an ectopic ureterocele associated 
with a duplex kidney was found during follow-up of prenatal hydronephrosis were
reviewed retrospectively. All infants underwent voiding cystourethrography,
ultrasonography, and Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy.
RESULTS: All upper moieties showed absent or depressed Tc-99m DMSA uptake. Upper 
moiety functional impairment was associated with structural abnormalities shown
by ultrasonography. The degree of functional impairment was reflective of
ultrasonographically defined cortical thickness relative to pelvic diameter, but 
this relation varied. Eight of 20 (40%) lower moieties had diffusely depressed
relative Tc-99m DMSA uptake. Focal defects were also present in three of these
eight (38%) lower moieties. Lower moiety functional impairment was associated
with higher degrees of pelvic dilatation and with vesicoureteral reflux.
Ultrasonography revealed diffuse parenchymal thinning in four of the eight (50%) 
lower moieties with depressed uptake. Ultrasonography did not define focal
parenchymal loss in any lower moiety.
CONCLUSIONS: The degree to which function is impaired in the upper moieties of
duplex kidneys with ureters terminating in ectopic ureteroceles is not highly
predictable by ultrasonography. Lower moiety functional impairment and cortical
defects are frequently present in these kidneys and often occur without
ultrasonographic evidence of parenchymal damage. Use of renal cortical
scintigraphy in the diagnostic evaluation of infants with ectopic ureteroceles is
supported.

Seng, Singapore 308433. michelle_jong@notes.tish.gov.sg

INTRODUCTION: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare thyroid malignancy but 
accounts for a significant mortality. We present 2 cases of MTC and review the
literature regarding its management and genetic screening.
CLINICAL PICTURE: Patient 1 presented after a routine health screening and
subsequently was found to have a germline mutation for MEN 2A. Patient 2
presented with sweating irritability and a thyroid mass which illustrates the
progressive relentless nature of the disease and highlights current imaging
practice.
TREATMENT: Both patients underwent extensive surgery and received postoperatively
ablative dose of radioactive iodine. Patient 2 also had a large dose I-131 MIBG
therapy and further surgery.
OUTCOME: In Patient 1, postoperative calcitonins remained elevated indicating
residual disease. Patient 2 underwent further radioguided surgery; however, his
postoperative calcitonins remained elevated.
CONCLUSION: MTC can be relentless. Routine genetic screening of all patients with
MTC, Tc-99m pentavalent (V) DMSA imaging, near total thyroidectomy with routine
central neck dissections and removal of all lymph nodes in the central neck
compartment should be performed.

Tc-99m MIBI, Tc-99m tetrofosmin, and Tc-99m (V) DMSA accumulation in recurrent
malignant thymoma.

Kim SJ(1), Kim IJ, Kim YK.

Author information:

University, Korea.

Thymoma is the most common primary tumor of the anterior mediastinum, accounting 
for 20% to 30% of all mediastinal tumors. The recurrence rate after total
resection of the thymoma ranges from 8% to 18%. The authors describe a patient
with recurrent malignant thymoma imaged with Tc-99m MIBI, Tc-99m tetrofosmin, and
Tc-99m (V) DMSA. Early and delayed Tc-99m MIBI and Tc-99m tetrofosmin
scintigraphy showed increased uptake in the mediastinal area, as did Tc-99m (V)
DMSA scintigraphy. Coronal SPECT images obtained with Tc-99m MIBI, Tc-99m
tetrofosmin, and Tc-99m (V) DMSA showed increased uptake in the mediastinal
lesion seen on a computed tomograph of the chest. However, the normal blood-pool 
activity of the heart and great vessels imaged with Tc-99m (V) DMSA obscured the 
recurrent malignant thymoma. Although Tc-99m (V) DMSA is a useful tumor-seeking
agent, Tc-99m MIBI and Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT are preferred to Tc-99m (V) DMSA 
to detect primary and recurrent malignant thymoma.

Color and power Doppler sonography versus DMSA scintigraphy in acute
pyelonephritis and in prediction of renal scarring.

Hitzel A(1), Liard A, Véra P, Manrique A, Ménard JF, Dacher JN.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.

Capabilities of color and power Doppler sonography (DS) were prospectively
evaluated for diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and for prediction of scarring by
comparison with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA).METHODS:
Fifty-seven children (mean age, 5 +/- 3 y) with acute pyelonephritis were
investigated by biologic testing, DS (DS 1), and DMSA (DMSA 1). Patients who were
<6 mo old or had high-grade reflux or obstruction were excluded. Forty-five
children had a clinical follow-up examination, biologic testing, DS (DS 2), and
DMSA (DMSA 2) at a mean of 7 +/- 2 mo after acute infection. Sonography
(gray-scale and DS) was performed by 1 experienced radiologist who was unaware of
patient data. DMSA studies were interpreted by 2 physicians who were unaware of
patient data.
RESULTS: Temperature, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein value were
significantly higher in patients with abnormal DMSA 1 findings than in those with
abnormal DS 1 findings (P < 0.05). When compared with DMSA 1, DS 1 had a
sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 81%, respectively. At follow-up, all
clinical and biologic data had normalized. Scarring after infection occurred in
51% of children. When compared with DMSA 2, DS 1 had positive and negative
predictive values of 57% and 75%, respectively, and DMSA 1 had respective values 
of 62% and 100%. Reflux was not considered a good predictor of scarring.
CONCLUSION: DS and DMSA results were concordant in 81% of kidneys with acute
pyelonephritis. The predictive value of DS for renal scarring was not considered 
sufficiently high for DS to be used in routine practice.

Associations of lead biomarkers and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and
vitamin D receptor genotypes with hematopoietic outcomes in Korean lead workers.

Lee SS(1), Lee BK, Lee GS, Stewart WF, Simon D, Kelsey K, Todd AC, Schwartz BS.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Industrial Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Chonan, Korea.

OBJECTIVES: This study compares and contrasts associations of dimercaptosuccinic 
acid (DMSA)-chelatable lead, tibia lead, and blood lead with five hematopoietic
outcomes and evaluates the effect modification of these relations by
polymorphisms in the delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) and vitamin D
receptor (VDR) genes.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 798 lead workers and 135 unexposed referents 
was performed.
RESULTS: The DMSA-chelatable lead, tibia lead, and blood lead levels ranged in
the lead (Pb) workers from 4.8 to 2103 g, -7 to 338 g Pb/g bone mineral, and 4 to
86 g/dl, respectively. The mean of the hemoglobin, hematocrit, zinc
protoporphyrin (ZPP), and urinary (ALAU) and plasma (ALAP) delta-aminolevulinic
acid levels of the lead workers were 14.2 (SD 1.4) g/dl, 42.4 (SD 4.4)%, 80.2 (SD
63.5) g/dl, 2.1 (SD 3.7) mg/l, and 17.7 (20.6) g/ml, respectively. After
adjustment for the covariates, tibia lead was associated with all five
hematopoietic outcomes, while blood lead and DMSA-chelatable lead were associated
only with ZPP, ALAP, and ALAU. A comparison of the regression coefficients, total
model adjusted R2 values, and delta R2 values revealed that blood lead was the
best predictor of ZPP, ALAP, and ALAU. Only tibia lead was significantly
associated with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, but the additional variance
explained by tibia lead was (<1%). No clear effect modification of the relations 
between the lead biomarkers and hematopoietic outcomes studied was caused by ALAD
or VDR genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Lead must have a chronic, cumulative effect on hemoglobin and
hematocrit levels, and any speculated mechanism cannot merely involve short-term 
plasma or target organ lead levels.

University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610-0296, USA.

Accurate diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) using clinical and laboratory
parameters is often difficult in children. The aims of this retrospective study
were twofold. Firstly, to correlate the clinical and laboratory manifestations of
APN with the results of the dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in
different age groups. Secondly, to compare the DMSA renal scan, renal
ultrasonography (RUS), and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in patients with
clinical APN. The DMSA renal scan was utilized as the gold standard for renal
involvement. We determined the sensitivity of these tests in febrile urinary
tract infections (UTI) in three age groups: group I less than 2 years; group II
2-8 years; group III older than 8 years. During the period January 1992 through
December 1998, 222 children presented with a febrile UTI. All patients had a DMSA
renal scan, 208 had contrast VCUG, and 163 had RUS. The clinical and laboratory
manifestation of pyelonephritis correlated better with a positive DMSA renal scan
in the older children than in the younger children; 85% of the DMSA renal scans
were positive in group III; 69% in group II; 48% in group I (P<0.001).
Vesicoureteral reflux detected by contrast VCUG was more prevalent in the younger
age groups. Although high grades of reflux (grade IV-V) correlated better with a 
positive DMSA renal scan, it did not reach a level of statistical significance
(P>0.05). RUS did not correlate with a positive DMSA renal scan in any age group.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of Gandou I (GD, a Chinese herbal preparation) 
and dimercaptosuccinate acid (DMSA) in treating Wilson disease (WD).
METHODS: Ninety-four patients with WD were divided into 2 groups, 32 cases in the
GD group and 62 in the DMSA group, they were treated with GD and DMSA
respectively. The therapeutic course was 4 weeks for both groups. Modified
Goldstein's Degree was adopted to evaluate the clinical effect.
RESULTS: The total effective rate of the GD group was 71.9%, which was similar to
that of the DMSA group (77.4%, P > 0.05). But the adverse reaction occurred in
the latter group was more than that in the former.
CONCLUSION: GD is a low toxic and highly effective drug for long-term treatment
of WD.

[Radioisotopic imaging of neuroendocrine tumours. Which radiopharmaceutical and
which diagnostic procedure?].

Neuroendocrine tumours can be visualized by several nuclear medicine modalities
based on different mechanisms of cellular uptake. The most widely used
radiopharmaceutical are the metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I/131I MIBG) and
pentetreotide (111In pentetreotide). The first tracer follows the metabolic
pathway of norephinephrine while the second one binds to somatostatin receptors
which are expressed with high intensity on the neuroendocrine tissue. Some
radiopharmaceuticals (Anti-CEA, Anti-CgA, Anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies) have
today only an experimental value, others such as 99mTc(V)DMSA had in the past
very limited indications (medullary thyroid cancer) but at present their
production is going to be stopped. An interesting series of new peptides showing 
a great affinity for the receptors/structures expressed by the neuroendocrine
tissue is under evaluation in order to obtain a better tumour specificity. Among 
the positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals, the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), in 
spite it is considered the most widely used tracer for clinical PET in oncology, 
did not show a satisfactory uptake in the well differentiated neuroendocrine
tissues. On the contrary 18F-FDG is the best radiopharmaceutical to visualize
those rare poorly differentiated neurondocrine tumours with a high proliferative 
index. For this reason also in this area, new radiopharmaceuticals have been
studies and developed. A serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) labelled
with 11C has shown an increased uptake in carcinoids. Another radiopharmaceutical
in development for PET is 11C L-DOPA which seems to be useful in visualizing
endocrine pancreatic tumours. 18F-DOPA whole body PET may be a more promising
imaging approach. Aim of this review is to summarize the potential of nuclear
medicine techniques in the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumours and to stresses
the renewed role of nuclear medicine in the management of this disease.

Intravenous mercury injection and ingestion: clinical manifestations and
management.

McFee RB(1), Caraccio TR.

Author information: 
(1)The Long Island Regional Poison Control Center, Winthrop University Hospital, 
Mineola, New York 11501, USA.

BACKGROUND: Mercury is a complex toxin with clinical manifestations determined by
the chemical form, route, dose, and acuity of the exposure. Parenteral injection 
of elemental mercury remains uncommon.
CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old male injected 3 mL of elemental mercury intravenously 
and ingested 3 mL as a suicide attempt. Within 24 hours, he became dyspneic,
febrile, tachycardic, and voiced mild gastrointestinal complaints. Chest X-ray
revealed scattered pulmonary infiltrates and embolized mercury bilaterally. A
ventilation/perfusion scan demonstrated ventilation/ perfusion deficits.
Additionally, his renal function declined, as manifest by minor elevations in
blood urea nitrogen and creatinine and decreased urine output. Pulmonary therapy,
intravenous hydration, and chelation using 2,3-dimercaptoscuccinic acid
(DMSA/Succimer) were started. Over the next 36 hours, the patient's pulmonary and
renal functions improved. Temperature and heart rate subsequently normalized, and
symptoms at discharge were mild exertional dyspnea.
DISCUSSION: Liquid mercury injected intravenously embolizes to the pulmonary
vasculature and perhaps vessels in other organs such as heart and kidney. In-situ
oxidation to inorganic mercury, which is directly toxic to a variety of tissues, 
may help explain the multisystem involvement.
CONCLUSION: Significant pulmonary dysfunction accompanied by radiographically
demonstrated mercury emboli and temporary abnormalities in several organs
improved shortly after initiation of chelation. The impact of chelation on
long-term outcome of parenteral mercury exposure remains uncharacterized.

[Evaluation of clinical value of technetium-99m(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid SPECT 
in diagnosis of parotid lump].

[Article in Chinese]

Wu X(1), Lin G, Zhang Q.

(1)Department of Stomatology, First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical
University, Fuzhou 350000.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of single photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT) on classifying parotid lump as benign or malignant before
treatment.
METHODS: SPECT images of the parotid region were obtained in forty-five patients 
with parotid lump before surgery. We used technetium-99m(V) dimercaptosuccinic
acid as imaging agent. The results were compared with their pathological
diagnoses, clinical examination, and ultrasonography.
RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of Tc-99m(V)-DMSA SPECT
imaging in determining malignancy of parotid lump were 93.7%, 72.4%, 80.0%,
respectively. The uptake ratios of parotid lesions were higher in malignant
tumors than benign tumors, cysts, and inflammatory lumps (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: It is suggested that Tc-99m (V)-DMSA SPECT can be a useful aided
method of preoperative diagnosis of parotid lumps. The uptake ratios can help
increase the accuracy of diagnoses. For the benign tumors and inflammatory masses
of parotid gland, the diagnoses had some false positives which may be reduced by 
combined clinical examination and ultrasonography.

Quantitative and qualitative scintigraphic measurement of renal function in dogs 
exposed to toxic doses of Gentamicin.

Author information: 
(1)Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidad de La Salle, Santafé de Bogotá, 
Colombia.

Five, 3-month-old mongrel dogs weighing between 4.5 to 5.5 kg were studied to
evaluate and compare the efficiency of 99mTc-DTPA, 99mTc-MAG3, and 99mTc-DMSA in 
detecting gentamicin-induced renal tubular injury. After baseline renograms using
all three methods, all dogs received daily intramuscular injections of gentamicin
at a dose of 30-45 mg/kg. Additional studies were obtained after a cumulative
dose of 450, 1,575, and 2,250 mg of gentamicin was reached. Glomerular filtration
rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and percentage of total renal
uptake measurements were calculated. Baseline and post-gentamicin injection blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine values were determined. A Duncan test
revealed significant renal function impairment at 450 mgs of cumulated gentamicin
with 99mTc-DMSA and at 1,575 mgs of cumulated gentamicin for 99mTc-DTPA and
99mTc-MAG3. There was no correlation between BUN and serum creatinine values when
compared to gentamicin (p > 0.05). The images obtained with 99mTc-MAG3 were of
better quality than those obtained with 99mTc-DTPA even under severe renal
dysfunction. Percentage of 99mTc-DMSA uptake indicated renal damage, before than 
GFR and ERPF. BUN and serum creatinine measurements were poor indicators of
gentamicin-induced renal failure.

Current therapeutic approaches in neuroendocrine tumours include surgery,
radiotherapy and polychemotherapy. Different metabolic patterns of neuroendocrine
tumours allow the use of a wide range of diagnostic options in nuclear medicine, 
due to the presence of a wide spectrum of radiotracers electively concentrating
in these neoplasms. Nuclear medicine, and in particular 111In Octreotide (OCT)
scintigraphy, 123I Methaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and pentavalent 99mTc-DMSA
(V-DMSA), together with biohumoral markers, are currently able to locate tumours 
also not detectable using traditional diagnostic techniques. Somatostatin
analogs, such as octreotide have become increasingly important over the years in 
the treatment of patients with neuroendocrine tumours. At present the therapeutic
use of somatostatin analogs can be schematised as 1) pharmacological treatment
(with cold octreotide); 2) surgical treatment (radioguided surgery); 3)
radiometabolic treatment (with marked octreotide). The development of new
synthetic molecules and new radiocompounds will probably open up interesting
scenarios in the near future.

Succimer treatment during ongoing lead exposure reduces tissue lead in suckling
rats.

There is a concern that oral treatment with succimer (meso-2,
3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA) can promote gastrointestinal lead absorption if 
not performed in a lead-safe environment. The scope of our investigation was to
evaluate the efficacy of oral DMSA treatment during oral lead exposure on tissue 
lead in suckling rats. Six-day-old Wistar rats of both genders were divided into 
two groups-untreated (Pb) and treated (Pb + DMSA)-with 10 animals per group. Lead
(as acetate) was given orally at a dose of 2 mg kg(-1) body weight day(-1) for
eight consecutive days (total dose 16 mg kg(-1), i.e. 0.08 mmol kg(-1)). During
this period the treated group received a daily dose of 0.5 mmol DMSA kg(-1) body 
weight p.o. six times on days 1-3 and 6-8 of the experiment (total dose 3 mmol
kg(-1)). Tissue lead was determined by means of atomic absorption spectrometry.
The DMSA efficiently reduced the lead concentration in the analysed tissues
(carcass, liver, kidneys and brain) by approximately 50% compared with untreated 
controls. The pups' growth and organ weights were not affected. In conclusion,
our results indicate that DMSA is an efficient oral lead chelator in sucklings
even if challenged with ongoing lead exposure.

Retrospective study of children with acute pyelonephritis. Evaluation of
bacterial etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility, drug management and imaging
studies.

(1)Department of Pediatrics, University of Padua, Italy.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the management of pyelonephritis in a
large Italian pediatric population. A total of 1,333 patients (36% male) were
considered. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated agent (89.9%),
followed by Proteus mirabilis (3.6%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (2.1%). 27% of
microorganisms were resistant to amoxicillin, 4% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 
11% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 2.4% to gentamicin and less than 2% to
ceftazidime. Despite this resistance pattern showing that oral antibiotics, such 
as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, are effective in vitro as well as parenteral
antimicrobials, a parenteral antibiotic was given initially to 756 (57.2%)
children. A prophylactic regimen was started in 922 patients with a rate of
reinfection during prophylaxis of 9.5%; a higher rate of reinfection was observed
in patients with reflux (25%) compared to children without reflux (3%) (p <
0.0001). Vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated in 30% of patients. The number of
renal abnormalities detected by DMSA in patients with and without reflux was
significantly different (p < 0.001). CRP was higher in patients with scars (p <
0.02). In conclusion, pyelonephritis represents a common disease with about 2,500
days of hospitalization per year in the Veneto Region where there is a pediatric 
population of about 800,000 under 15 years of age. The results of antimicrobial
in vitro tests indicate that amoxillicin/clavulanic acid could represent the
antibiotic of choice. The high frequency of malformations, observed even in
children between 6 and 12 years of age, may suggest the need of an imaging study 
including DMSA scan and VCUG in all age groups.

The utility of (99m)Tc-DMSA and Tc(99m)-EC scintigraphy for early diagnosis of
ifosfamide induced nephrotoxicity.

A serious undesired effect of certain cytostatics is their nephrotoxicity. In
this study, we investigated the toxic effects of ifosfamide and cisplatin by
clinical and biochemical parameters in relation to (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic
acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) and Tc(99m)N, N-ethylenedicysteine (EC) renal scintigraphy.
The indicators were urinary beta2-microglobulin levels, tubular resorption of
phosphate, urinary protein and glucose excretion, glomerular filtration rate,
urinary pH and osmolarity. Thirteen paediatric patients (seven boys and six
girls), aged 2-16 years, were investigated. Five patients received only
cisplatin, six patients were treated with ifosfamide and cisplatin and two with
ifosfamide and carboplatin for various malignancies. All except three patients
had normal DMSA uptake (median, 19; range, 16-29%) prior to chemotherapy. The
reduction in DMSA uptake was unilateral due to tumour invasion in those three
patients. Following chemotherapy, DMSA uptake showed reduction in five patients
with or without clinical nephrotoxicity. The observed pattern was decreased renal
uptake and elevated bladder activity. Three patients with decreased DMSA uptake
had normal tubular maximum phosphate reabsorption, which suggested subclinical
injury. Decrease in DMSA uptake and tubular phosphate reabsorption (TPR) was
detected simultaneously in two patients. No abnormalities were seen on Tc(99m)-EC
scintigraphy to suggest nephrotoxicity in our investigation. However, Tc(99m)-EC 
clearly demonstrated a reduction in split renal function in children with tumour 
invasion. In summary, we found that ifosfamide induced tubular injury can be
detected with (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy before chemotherapy associated
nephrotoxicity is observed by laboratory measurements. Our results also imply
that, although a tubular agent, renal scintigraphy performed with Tc(99m)-EC is
not able to detect subclinical injury or predict the outcome during treatment.

AIM: Value the utility of studies with 99mTc-DMSA with captopril (scintigraphy
imaging and unilateral renal function) in identifying renovascular disease or
renal disease in hypertension patients with high probability of renovascular
hypertension.
METHODS: We studied 27 hypertension patients (12 males, 15 females) mean age 49
years, SD: 9.46, with high probability of renovascular disease. General analysis 
and radiology was made to all of them including renal arteriography as gold
standard. Two renal scintigraphies with 99mTc-DMSA were made to all of them,
baseline study and one hour after administration of 50 mg of captopril, a week
between both studies. Renal scintigraphy (anterior and posterior images) was
obtained 4 hours after the administration of 111 MBq (3 mCi) of 99mTc-DMSA and
results were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively calculating unilateral
renal function. We considered positive for renovascular hypertension studies with
decrease of more than five percentual points in unilateral renal function or a
new defect absent in baseline study. Scintigraphic results were compared with
arteriography to determine sensitivity, specificity and predictive values.
RESULTS: Arteriography demonstrated significant renal artery stenosis in 18.5% of
patients. Renal scintigraphy with captopril using 99mTc-DMSA demonstrated
sensitivity of 60%, specificity of 91%, positive predictive value of 60% and
negative predictive value of 91%. We identified 3 patients with segmental defects
of uptake consistent with chronic pyelonephritis scarring.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies with 99mTc-DMSA using captopril present high specificity and
are useful in patients with high probability for renovascular hypertension,
identifying high number of patients with significant renal artery stenosis. The
utility of DMSA in identify renal abnormalities, as specially pyelonephritis
scarring, add value to renal studies with captopril using others tracers. DMSA
could identify renal etiologies of renovascular hypertension different to renal
artery stenosis.

Determining the relationship of DMSA uptake of the left versus right kidney is
theoretically one of the easiest quantitative procedures in nuclear medicine. The
quantification can be performed on the posterior view, with or without a lateral 
view for correction of kidney depth. The geometric mean can also be determined by
using both the anterior and the posterior views. This study has aimed to evaluate
if there are significant differences in the quantification of the renal function 
percentage using only the posterior view and the geometric mean. Furthermore, we 
evaluated to what extent the patient's age and diagnosis influenced these
differences. We have proposed a work protocol in which we indicate which cases
the geometric mean should be calculated in order to minimize the possible errors 
occurring when only the posterior view is used.A total of 328 renal
scintigraphies with 99mTc-DMSA performed at our Department in the last six months
were studied. The mean and standard deviation of the differences as well as the
correlation coefficient between both methods were calculated. The difference
between the right renal function in posterior view and the right renal function
obtained using the geometric mean was calculated for all the patients. The
Student's T test was applied to determine whether the differences between both
methods were statistically different from zero. Statistical differences were
found in patients older than 9 years and in patients with genitourinary
malformations.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical use of fluorine-18
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in medullary thyroid
cancer (MTC) on the basis of comparison with findings obtained using indium-111
pentetreotide (SMS), pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),
technetium-99m sestamibi (MIBI), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). One hundred FDG-PET examinations in 85 patients (40 males, 45
females) with elevated tumour marker levels and/or pathological findings on other
imaging methods were evaluated retrospectively. Eighty-two patients were examined
after total thyroidectomy, and the remaining three patients prior to surgery.
Overall, 181 lesions could be identified with at least one of the imaging
techniques. Fifty-five lesions were confirmed histologically. FDG-PET detected
123 of 181 sites, which is a lesion detection probability of 68%. In the 55 cases
with histological confirmation, we found 32 true positive, 3 false positive, 11
true negative and 9 false negative lesions using FDG-PET, resulting in a
sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 79%. Sensitivity and specificity were,
respectively, 25% and 92% for SMS, 33% and 78% for DMSA, 25% and 100% for MIBI,
50% and 20% for CT and 82% and 67% for MRI. Compared with morphological
techniques and functional imaging methods with single-photon emitters, FDG-PET
showed the highest lesion detection probability for MTC tissue, with a high
sensitivity and specificity. It is concluded that FDG-PET is a useful method in
the staging and follow-up of MTC.

Short-term exposure to dietary Pb and/or DMSA affects dopamine and dopamine
metabolite levels in the medulla, optic tectum, and cerebellum of rainbow trout
(Oncorhynchus mykiss).

Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were randomly assigned to one of the
following dietary exposure conditions: lead (Pb) solvent (2% nitric acid),
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) solvent (0.1 N NaOH), Pb, DMSA, Pb
followed by Pb solvent, or Pb followed by DMSA. Medulla, cerebellum, and optic
tectum homogenates were analyzed for dopamine (DA), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). DA levels in all brain regions tended to 
be highest for trout exposed to dietary Pb followed by dietary DMSA. DA levels
were elevated for trout exposed to dietary DMSA and Pb followed by Pb solvent. DA
levels were below control levels for trout exposed to Pb only. HVA levels varied 
across brain regions. However, HVA levels in all brain regions tended to be
elevated for trout exposed to dietary DMSA and Pb followed by Pb solvent. DOPAC
levels across all brain regions were below control levels for trout dietary
exposed to DMSA, Pb only, Pb followed by Pb solvent, and Pb followed by DMSA.
These data indicate that Pb and/or DMSA have the potential of altering DA, HVA,
and DOPAC levels in the medulla, cerebellum, and optic tectum. The animal model
of short-term dietary exposure to Pb and DMSA, both alone and sequentially, to
mimic dietary exposure to Pb and the oral delivery of DMSA, that our laboratory
has developed, may be useful in future studies aimed at characterizing the
neurobiological mechanisms by which Pb and/or DMSA alter neurotransmitter levels 
and behavior.

(1)Department of Pediatrics and Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, National 
Cheng Kung University Medical Center and College of Medicine, 138 Sheng-Li Rd,
Tainan, Taiwan 704, Republic of China.

PURPOSE: To evaluate whether acute pyelonephritis lesion volume derived from
acute technetium 99m ((99m)Tc) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal single photon
emission computed tomographic (SPECT) images is predictive of the development of 
subsequent renal fibrosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with acute pyelonephritis underwent (99m)Tc DMSA 
renal SPECT during acute infection and 6-10 months later. At quantitative
analysis, the volume of photopenic lesions and the ratio of radioactivity in the 
photopenic lesion to that in normal renal tissue were calculated. Sensitivity,
specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were determined.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine acute pyelonephritis foci in 44 children were analyzed.
Thirty-seven (54%) of these lesions were normal on follow-up renal scans, while
32 (46%) developed scars. Significant differences in the photopenic lesion volume
were found between the two groups (P < .001). When photopenic lesion volume
indicated a positive diagnosis (>or=4.6-cm(3) lesion volume), sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive, and negative predictive values were 96.7%,
92.3%, 90.6%, and 97.3%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Quantitative analysis of acute DMSA renal SPECT findings is valuable 
in predicting renal fibrosis. The volume of an acute pyelonephritis lesion is
useful in predicting the development of fibrosis.

The aim of this study was to compare, in children with acute pyelonephritis, the 
efficacy of 7 days' (group A) and 3 days' (group B) intravenous antibiotics, both
followed by an oral treatment. Children were randomized after 3 days of
intravenous treatment. Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy
was performed within the first days after admission and repeated 6 months later. 
Total or partial persistence of renal abnormalities on the 6-month DMSA
scintigraphy was used as the endpoint of the study. Among the 92 children
included in the study, 87 were followed for at least 6 months (43 in group A and 
44 in group B) and were eligible for analysis. Late DMSA was abnormal in 9
kidneys of group A and 12 kidneys of group B, representing respectively 24% and
44% of kidneys with abnormalities on the initial DMSA (difference statistically
not significant). When the patients were stratified according to the delay of
treatment, the percentage of patients with sequelae in group A was comparable,
whether the delay was less or more than 1 week. In group B, the percentage of
patients with sequelae was significantly higher (P<0.01) when the delay was more 
than 1 week.

Photodegradation study of the antifouling booster biocide dichlofluanid in
aqueous media by gas chromatographic techniques.

Sakkas VA(1), Konstantinou LK, Albanis TA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Ioannina, Greece.

The aquatic photochemical behavior of the biocide dichlofluanid has been studied 
under natural sunlight conditions as well as under artificial solar irradiation
in different types of natural waters (sea, river and lake water) as well as in
distilled water. In order to examine the effect of dissolved organic matter
(DOM), the photodegradation of the tested biocide was investigated also in the
presence of various concentrations of humic and fulvic acids. It was found that
the photodegradation proceeds via first-order reaction in all cases and that the 
presence of various concentrations of DOM inhibits the photolysis reaction.
Kinetic experiments are monitored with GC-ECD with half-lives varied between 8
and 83 h. The major photodecomposition products identified by GC-MS were
dichlorofluoromethane, aniline, and DMSA. Based on this byproduct identification 
a possible degradation pathway is proposed for the photolysis of dichlofluanid in
aqueous media.

We present three patients, aged 4, 6 and 8 years old, with a diagnosis of urinary
tract infection. In all patients, initial ultrasonographic studies revealed a
single area of acute lobar nephronia (ALN). The patients underwent renal
scintigraphy with dimercaptosuccinic acid-99mTc (DMSA Tc 99m), which showed
multiple foci with below normal uptake in both kidneys of two patients,
consistent with bilateral multifocal bacterial nephritis. Although this entity
has been reported together with ALN in adults, very few pediatric cases have been
reported. We emphasize the diagnostic value of ultrasonography and renal
scintigraphy.

Australia. nvk@imag.wsahs.nsw.gov.au

It has been shown previously that renal kit, trivalent technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid [99mTc(III)-DMSA], can be transformed into tumour imaging
agent, pentavalent technetium-99m DMSA [99mTc(V)-DMSA], by adding sodium
bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and subsequently bubbling with oxygen. However, the purity
of this pentavalent preparation was reported to be in the range 83-94% at best.
In this study, the preparation of ultrahigh-purity 99mTc(V)-DMSA is described,
and the role of stannous oxidation in the conversion of 99mTc(III)-DMSA to
99mTc(V)-DMSA is evaluated in order to understand the underlying mechanism. The
results show that controlled oxygen bubbling increases the 99mTc(V)-DMSA levels, 
with a concomitant decrease in the 99mTc(III)-DMSA levels, in a time-dependent
pattern. The purity of the pentavalent DMSA is shown to be consistently very high
(>99%), as estimated by chromatography, and this correlates very well with the
minimal or no renal uptake of this compound in patient studies.

We attempted to verify in a group of 101 children with first urinary tract
infection whether it was possible to identify groups of patients with different
risks of developing renal scarring by taking into account both the extent of
kidney involvement documented in the acute phase of infection using a
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, and the presence or absence of
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The frequency of persistent lesions in kidneys with 
mild-moderate lesions (less than 50% of kidney involvement) in the presence of
VUR or in non-refluxing kidneys was similar (P=0.1447), while the frequency of
persistent lesions in kidneys with severe lesions in the presence of VUR was
significantly higher than the frequency of persistent lesions in non-refluxing
kidneys (P=0.0089). The extent of kidney involvement and the presence of VUR make
possible the identification of different categories of risk of scarring: in the
"low risk group" (normal kidney with/without VUR) the risk of scarring is 0%; in 
the "intermediate risk group" (mild lesions with/without VUR; extensive lesions
without VUR) the risk of scarring is between 14% and 38%, while in the "high risk
group" (extensive lesions with VUR) the risk of scarring is 88%. Quantifying the 
risk of scarring could help in planning the treatment or in modifying the later
strategy.

Effect of L-arginine, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and the association of
L-arginine and DMSA on tissue lead mobilization and blood pressure level in
plumbism.

Paulista, Rubião Júnior, SP, Brasil.

Lead (Pb)-induced hypertension is characterized by an increase in reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and a decrease in nitric oxide (NO). In the present study we
evaluated the effect of L-arginine (NO precursor), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA,
a chelating agent and ROS scavenger), and the association of L-arginine/DMSA on
tissue Pb mobilization and blood pressure levels in plumbism. Tissue Pb levels
and blood pressure evolution were evaluated in rats exposed to: 1) Pb (750 ppm,
in drinking water, for 70 days), 2) Pb plus water for 30 more days, 3) Pb plus
DMSA (50 mg kg(-1) day(-1), p.o.), L-arginine (0.6%, in drinking water), and the 
combination of L-arginine/DMSA for 30 more days, and 4) their respective matching
controls. Pb exposure increased Pb levels in the blood, liver, femur, kidney and 
aorta. Pb levels in tissues decreased after cessation of Pb administration,
except in the aorta. These levels did not reach those observed in nonintoxicated 
rats. All treatments mobilized Pb from the kidney, femur and liver. Pb
mobilization from the aorta was only effective with the L-arginine/DMSA
treatment. Blood Pb concentrations in Pb-treated groups were not different from
those of the Pb/water group. Pb increased blood pressure starting from the 5th
week. L-arginine and DMSA treatments (4th week) and the combination of
L-arginine/DMSA (3rd and 4th weeks) decreased blood pressure levels of
intoxicated rats. These levels did not reach those of nonintoxicated rats.
Treatment with L-arginine/DMSA was more effective than the isolated treatments in
mobilizing Pb from tissues and in reducing the blood pressure of intoxicated
rats.

BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections in
infants. It presents certain peculiarities compared with other pediatric age
groups in terms of symptomatology, diagnosis and the therapeutic approach
employed to prevent sequels.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiology, clinical and laboratory findings,
etiology, diagnosis and treatment of first-time UTI in healthy infants.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January and December 1999, we performed a
retrospective study of 131 previously healthy infants admitted to our hospital
with a diagnosis of first-time UTI. Demographic data, clinical characteristics,
urine dipstick, urinalysis and urine culture (vesical catheterization), blood
cell count and PCR, kidney ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrogram and DMSA
scintigraphy were reviewed.
RESULTS: We studied 131 patients (median age: 90 days). In infants younger than
30 days, UTI was more prevalent in males. The most frequent symptom was fever
(73.3 %). Seventy-one patients fulfilled the criteria for acute pyelonephritis.
The presence of nitrituria was low. Escherichia coli was isolated in 90.1 % of
the patients. Voiding cystourethrogram detected vesicoureteric reflux in 18.4 %
of the patients. Scintigraphy revealed renal scarring in 15.1 %. No significant
correlations were found between renal scarring in late scintigraphy and a
diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and/or alterations in the cystourethrogram.
CONCLUSIONS: Fever was the main symptom. E. coli was the most commonly isolated
microorganism. Nitrituria had low sensitivity in infants. Ultrasonography had low
specificity. Scintigraphy showed the highest sensitivity and specificity in the
detection of renal scarring. Predictability improved when scintigraphy was
performed a few months after acute infection.

A new water-soluble cyclam acid porphyrin (CAP), 5,10,15,20-tetrakis
[4-[4',8',11'-tris(carboxymethyl)-1'-(1',4',8',11'-tetraazacyclotetradecane)amido
methyleneoxy]phenyl] porphyrin has been synthesised, characterised and labelled
with 99mTc. In vivo distribution studies were performed in C6-gliomas and
N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) induced mammary tumour bearing rats and scintiimages
were obtained at 5 h post-administration of the labelled ligand using gamma
camera computer system. Tumour to muscle (T/M) ratios were determined and
compared with currently available tumour seeking radiopharmaceuticals such as
99mTc(V)-DMSA, 99mTc-Citrate and 201TlCl. In the case of NMU induced mammary
tumour rats the ratios were 6.93, 1.97, 5.30 and 3.29; while in the case of
C6-gliomas the ratios were 5.58, 2.18, 3.96 and 3.02 for 99mTc-CAP,
99mTc(V)-DMSA, 99mTc-Citrate and 203TlCl, respectively.

nils.hackstein@radiol.med.uni-giessen.de

OBJECTIVE: We present preliminary results of a new method (hereinafter called
'CT-clearance') to measure single kidney contrast media clearance by performing
multiphasic helical CT of the kidneys. CT-clearance was calculated according to
an extension of the Patlak-Plot. In contrast to prior investigators, who
repeatedly measured a single slice, this method makes it possible to calculate
single kidney clearance from at least three spiral CTs, utilizing the whole
kidney volume.
METHODS: Spiral CT of the kidneys was performed unenhanced and about 30 and 100 s
after administration of about 120 ml iopromide. Sum-density of the whole kidneys 
and aortic density was calculated from this data. Using this data, renal
clearance of contrast media was calculated by CT-clearance in 29 patients. As
reference, Serum-clearance was calculated in 24 patients by application of a
modified one-exponential slope model. Information on the relative kidney function
was gained by renal scintigraphy with Tc99m-MAG-3 or Tc99m-DMSA in 29 patients.
RESULTS: Linear regression analysis revealed a correlation coefficient of
CT-clearance with Serum-clearance of r=0.78 with Cl (CT) [ml/min]=22.2+1.03 * Cl 
(serum), n=24. Linear regression of the relative kidney function (rkf) of the
right kidney calculated by CT-clearance compared to scintigraphy results provided
a correlation coefficient r=0.89 with rkf(CT)[%]=18.6+0.58 * rkf(scintigraphy),
n=29.
CONCLUSION: The obtained results of contrast media clearance measured by
CT-clearance are in the physiological range of the parameter. Future studies
should be performed to improve the methodology with the aim of higher accuracy.
More specifically, better determination of the aortic density curve might improve
the accuracy.

[Calculation of the partial function of the kidney with DMSA in pediatrics: is
the evaluation of the geometric mean necessary?].

For assessment of differential renal function (PF) by means of static renal
scintigraphy with Tc-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) the calculation of the
geometric mean of counts from the anterior and posterior view is recommended.AIM:
Of this retrospective study was to find out, if the anterior view is necessary to
receive an accurate differential renal function by calculating the geometric mean
compared to calculating PF using the counts of the posterior view only.
METHODS: 164 DMSA-scans of 151 children (86 f, 65 m) aged 16 d to 16 a (4.7 +/-
3.9 a) were reviewed. The scans were performed using a dual head gamma camera
(Picker Prism 2000 XP, low energy ultra high resolution collimator, matrix 256 x 
256, 300 kcts/view, Zoom: 1.6-2.0). Background corrected values from both kidneys
anterior and posterior were obtained. Using region of interest technique PF was
calculated using the counts of the dorsal view and compared with the calculated
geometric mean [SQR(Ctsdors x Ctsventr)].
RESULTS: The differential function of the right kidney was significantly less
when compared to the calculation of the geometric mean (p < 0.01). The mean
difference between the PFgeom and the PFdors was 1.5 +/- 1.4%. A difference > or 
= 5% (5.0-9.5%) was obtained in only 6/164 scans (3.7%). Three of 6 patients
presented with an underestimated PFdors due to dystopic kidneys on the left side 
in 2 patients and on the right side in one patient. The other 3 patients with a
difference > 5% did not show any renal abnormality.
CONCLUSION: The calculation of the PF from the posterior view only will give an
underestimated value of the right kidney compared to the calculation of the
geometric mean. This effect is not relevant for the calculation of the
differential renal function in orthotopic kidneys, so that in these cases the
anterior view is not necessary. However, geometric mean calculation to obtain
reliable values for differential renal function should be applied in cases with
an obvious anatomical abnormality.

Model to evaluate the toxic effect of drugs: vincristine effect in the mass of
organs and in the distribution of radiopharmaceuticals in mice.

There are evidences that the biodistribution of radiopharmaceuticals can be
modified by some drugs. As chemotherapeutic drugs present important toxic
effects, we studied the vincristine effect in the mass of organs and are trying
to develop a model to evaluate the action of chemotherapeutic drug using the
biodistribution of radiopharmaceuticals. Vincristine was administered (n=15) into
female Balb/c mice, the organs isolated and their mass determined. To study the
vincristine effect in the biodistribution of technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (99mTc-DMSA) or technetium-99m-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid
(99mTc-DTPA), vincristine (0.03 mg) was administered in the animals (n=15) in
three doses. 99mTc-DMSA or 99mTc-DTPA was injected 1h after the last dose. After 
0.5h, the animals were sacrificed and the percentage of radioactivity (%ATI) and 
the percentage of radioactivity per gram of tissue (%ATI/g) in each organ were
calculated. The results have shown that the mass decreased significantly
(Wilcoxon test, P<0.05) in thymus, spleen, ovary, uterus, kidneys, pancreas. The 
%ATI to 99mTc-DMSA increased in lung, pancreas, heart, thyroid, brain, and bone, 
and the %ATI/g increased in uterus, ovary, spleen, thymus, kidney, lung, liver,
pancreas, heart, thyroid, brain and bone. To 99mTc-DTPA, the %ATI increased in
uterus, ovary, spleen, thymus, kidney, lung, liver, stomach, heart and bone, and 
the %ATI/g increased in uterus, ovary, spleen, thymus, kidney, lung, liver,
stomach, heart and bone. The results were statistically significant (Wilcoxon
test). The results can be explained by the metabolization, therapeutic,
toxicological or immunosupressive action of the vincristine. This model,
probably, should be used to evaluate the toxic effect of various drugs.

The preventive effect of Coriandrum sativum, Fam. UMBELLIFERAE (Chinese parsley) 
on lead deposition was investigated in male ICR mice given lead (1000 ppm) as
lead acetate trihydrate in drinking water for 32 days. Administration of Chinese 
parsley to mice by gastric intubation was performed for 25 days from day 7 after 
the start of lead exposure up to the end of the experiment. The mice were then
sacrificed for comparison of lead distribution. The lead reached its highest
concentration in the femur but localized lead deposition in the femur was
significantly decreased by meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), a chelating
agent used as a positive control to validate this experimental model.
Administration of Chinese parsley also significantly decreased lead deposition in
the femur and severe lead-induced injury in the kidneys. In addition, urinary
excretion of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) which is known to increase with lead
intake was significantly decreased after administration of Chinese parsley. The
MeOH extract of Chinese parsley also reduced lead-induced inhibition of
delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity in vitro. These results
suggest that Chinese parsley has suppressive activity on lead deposition,
probably resulting from the chelation of lead by some substances contained in
Chinese parsley.

Oral ceftibuten switch therapy for acute pyelonephritis in children.

Vilaichone A(1), Watana D, Chaiwatanarat T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University,
Bangkok, Thailand.

The available oral third generation of cephalosporin, "ceftibuten" was used to
substitute the intravenous drug after defervescence in acute pyelonephritis in
children. This randomized controlled study compared the efficacy of an oral
ceftibuten switch therapy with a ceftriaxone in both short-term and long-term
outcomes. 36 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan proved pyelonephritis
patients were randomized into the study group, "ceftibuten" (N=18) and the
control group, "ceftriaxone" (N=18). Ceftriaxone (75 mg/kg/day) was the initial
antibiotic in both groups. After defervescence for 24-48 hours, oral ceftibuten
(9 mg/kg/day) was substituted in the study group and continued for 10 days. The
subject characteristics and laboratory data were not different between the two
groups. The urine culture at D14 was sterilized in both groups. The incidence of 
renal scarring was 66.6 per cent and 61.1 per cent in the study group and the
control group respectively. The rate of recurrent infection showed no statistical
significance. The duration of hospitalization was shorter in the study group than
in the control. In conclusion, oral ceftibuten switch therapy can be recommended 
as a safe and effective treatment for acute pyelonephritis in children. The use
of oral therapy may result in a significant reduction of health care expenditure.

Angiotensin converting enzyme gene polymorphism in primary vesicoureteral reflux.

Ohtomo Y(1), Nagaoka R, Kaneko K, Fukuda Y, Miyano T, Yamashiro Y.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery, Juntendo University School of 
Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.

We studied the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) gene in 78 patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux
(VUR), and examined renal function by dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) renoscintigraphy
and diethylenetriamine-penta-acetic acid (DTPA) renogram in each genotype.
Patients were classified into three genotypes according to the ACE gene I/D
polymorphisms: 32 in II genotype, 36 in ID, and 10 in DD. The incidence of
presumably congenital unilateral small kidneys was high in DD patients (70%).
Glomerular filtration rate obtained from DTPA renogram was 120.7+/-35.7 ml/min
(expressed as mean+/-SD) in II genotype, 111.7+/-33.3 in ID, and 88.0+/-18.0 in
DD. The total quantitative DMSA tracer uptake of both kidneys was also low in
patients with the D allele. This study shows that the D allele of ACE gene is
closely related to small congenital kidneys with refluxing ureters in patients
with primary VUR, and in accordance with previous reports, this allele is also
related to the progression of reflux nephropathy.

Lewisite is a highly toxic arsenic compound which can cause skin damage. In the
present study effects of Lewisite on cell membrane integrity and energy
metabolism as well as antidotal effects of DL-2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonate
(DMPS), and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (m-DMSA) were investigated in a
keratinocyte derived cell line (SCL II) and primary human keratinocytes (HK).
Cells were incubated in Lewisite (60 microM) containing medium for 5 min. During 
the following 6 h lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the supernatant,
intracellular ATP content, tetrazolium reduction, glucose consumption and lactate
formation were measured. Glucose consumption and lactate production were
decreased in both cell lines after Lewisite exposure. In SCL II cells an increase
of LDH activity in the supernatant, a decrease of ATP content, and an impaired
ability to reduce tetrazolium was found 3 h after Lewisite exposure. In HK
cultures tetrazolium reduction was significantly decreased already after 2 h,
whereas LDH increase in the supernatant and ATP content decrease occurred only at
6 h after Lewisite exposure. When DMPS or m-DMSA was added directly after
Lewisite exposure to SCL II cells, glucose consumption and lactate formation were
restored and LDH leakage was prevented. SCL II cells might be more prone to
membrane damage whereas in keratinocytes mitochondrial impairment seems to be the
predominant effect of Lewisite.

OBJECTIVE: To review the radioisotope studies in Nephrourology that are
frequently performed in the Nuclear Medicine Department, their clinical
applications and diagnostic yield.
METHODS/RESULTS: Radionuclide studies in Nephrourology allow evaluation of
different aspects of renal function after intravenous injection of radioisotopes 
by blood volume/time (ml/min) measurements (glomerular filtration rate, effective
renal plasma flow) or visualization in the form of images or graphic display
(renal scintigraphy, sequential study, renography) that permit determination of
the differential renal function. A sequential study, diuresis renography or
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor renography can be performed to
evaluate the changes in renal function induced by the diuretics or ACE
inhibitors. Radionuclide cystography permits detecting vesicoureteric reflux.
These radioisotope studies are commonly utilized in detecting reflux nephropathy 
and renal scarring (renal scintigraphy and radionuclide cystography), obstructive
nephropathy (diuresis renography), renovascular hypertension (ACE inhibitor
renography) and in evaluating renal transplantation (sequential study,
renography, diuresis renography and ACE inhibitor renography).
CONCLUSION: Radionuclide studies have different applications in Nephrourology,
some of which are considered to be diagnostic gold standards, such as renal
scintigraphy with DMSA to detect cortical anomalies, ACE inhibitor renography to 
identify hypertensive patients that will not benefit from revascularization
surgery and to determine the glomerular filtration rate. Other studies, such as
diuretic renography, are not considered to be gold standards due to the lack of
standardized protocols.

Acute renal cortical scintigraphy in children with a first urinary tract
infection.

This prospective study, performed in 101 children with a first symptomatic
urinary tract infection (UTI), evaluates the diagnostic value of clinical,
biological, and ultrasound parameters in detecting children with acute renal
infection documented by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. In children 
with a positive DMSA scan, mean C-reactive protein (CRP) was higher than in
children with a normal DMSA scan (114+/-64 vs. 67+/-38 mg/dl, mean+/-SD,
P=0.0002). The sensitivity and specificity of CRP was 64% and 68%, respectively. 
In children with severe kidney involvement, mean CRP and white blood count (WBC) 
were higher than in children with mild/moderate disease (151+/-83 vs. 92+/-55
mg/dl for CRP, P=0.0149; 20,100+/-6,854 vs. 15,023+/-6,145 WBC/ mm3 for WBC,
P=0.0131). The sensitivity and specificity was 85% and 20% for CRP, and 77% and
18% for WBC, respectively. One or more areas of abnormal cortical echogenicity
were documented in 3% of kidneys with positive DMSA scans. Dilatation of the
collecting system was observed in 24% of kidneys. The sensitivity and specificity
of ultrasonography was 27% and 89%, respectively. In conclusion, clinical,
biological, and ultrasound parameters do not accurately distinguish cystitis from
pyelonephritis in children with UTI and do not identify children with severe
renal damage. Accordingly, we recommend that DMSA scan should be added to the
initial work-up of children with UTI.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of 
pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid [99mTc-(V)DMSA] and
99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) in the detection of primary breast cancer 
and metastatic lymph node involvement, and in the clarification of cases with
indeterminate mammograms. Forty-one women (mean age+/-SD 55+/-7 years) referred
for a suspicious breast lesion on physical examination and/or an abnormal
mammogram underwent MIBI and (V)DMSA scintimammography (SMM) at separate sessions
(48-h interval). Lateral prone and anterior supine images were obtained at 10 and
60 min after administration of 740-925 MBq of each tracer, in the arm
contralateral to the breast lesion. The ipsilateral axillary region was also
included in the field of view. The results of SMM and mammography were compared
with histological findings. Breast cancer was histologically confirmed in 26
patients (mean diameter+/-SD 2.87+/-1.5 cm). Benign lesions were found in 15
patients (mean diameter+/-SD 2.04+/-2.7 cm). Mammography was definitely positive 
in 23/26 patients with breast cancer and indeterminate in 3/26 (sensitivity
88.4%). In benign lesions, mammography was true negative in 5/15 cases and
indeterminate in 10/15 (specificity 33.3%). Both MIBI and (V)DMSA SMM detected
23/26 breast cancers (sensitivity 88.4%) and were true negative in 14/15
(specificity 93.3%). T/B ratios for breast cancer in MIBI and (V)DMSA scans were 
similar, and significantly higher than for benign lesions. MIBI correctly
diagnosed 12/13 and (V)DMSA 11/13 cases in which the findings of mammography were
indeterminate. In addition, (V)DMSA detected seven of eight cases of in situ
ductal carcinoma (DCIS) associated with infiltrating carcinomas, while MIBI
detected only two of these eight cases. (V)DSMA was also diffusely concentrated
in benign lesions complicated by epithelial hyperplasia. Metastatic lymph node
involvement was successfully imaged in 15/19 patients with metastatic disease by 
both agents (sensitivity 78.9%), while true-negative scans were observed in 19/22
(specificity 86.3%) patients with benign or malignant tumours without lymph node 
metastases. Linear regression analysis revealed a high coefficient of correlation
between the (V)DMSA and the MIBI T/B ratios (r=0.8 P<0.001). We conclude that
both (V)DMSA and MIBI show an excellent ability to detect breast cancer and its
lymph node metastases. (V)DMSA also has a tendency to be diffusely and more
intensely localised than MIBI in pre-invasive lesions, such as DCIS or
epitheliosis, which are at risk of developing into malignancies. (V)DMSA could
therefore provide a useful tool in the diagnosis of such lesions and possibly
modify a predefined surgical plan. Finally, we believe that both tracers could
offer an alternative method for elucidating nondiagnostic mammograms.

To examine features of primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) at birth following
prenatal hydronephrosis and to describe the course of congenital damage in the
first two years of life. We reviewed the records of 382 patients with prenatally 
diagnosed dilated urinary tracts seen during a 15-years period. When fetal
hydronephrosis was confirmed at birth, voiding cystography was performed. If a
VUR was diagnosed dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renography, at 1 month of age,
was also performed. Cystography and DMSA renography were repeated and 1 and 2
years of age. Of 382 patients with prenatal hydronephrosis, 68 (17.8%) had
primary VUR (50 male and 18 female, M:F = 3:1). VUR was unilateral in 24 patients
and bilateral in 44 for a total of 112 refluxing renal units (RRUs). High-grade
VUR (grade > or = 4) was found in 70 (62.5%) RRUs, and 60 (85.7%) were boys.
Grade V reflux was observed in 96.5% of males. At birth, 22 (20%) RRUs had
moderate impairment of renal function. In 12 (10%) RRUs (grade > or = 4) was
demonstrated by a severe decrease in renal function. In all cases no focal
scarring was noted. Eight infants (all males), with grade 5 degrees VUR, in the
first six months of life had surgical treatment. The majority of the RRUs
(110/112 = 89%) were followed medically. Mild reflux (grade I-III) had resolved
in 81% RRUs, severe reflux (grade > or = 4) had resolved in 38% RRUs. Serial
renal scans during the follow-up showed no progression of renal damage. VUR
diagnosed at birth on prenatal ultrasonography is associated with congenital
damage, with males affected more often than females. In patients without
infection, after two years, modification of renal function or renal scars are
very rarely observed.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential use of technetium 99m (99mTc) (V)
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in the detection and localization of 
intestinal inflammation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 62 patients who were suspected of 
having intestinal inflammation and 30 control subjects were enrolled. All
patients underwent 99mTc (V) DMSA scintigraphy and colonoscopy with biopsy within
1 week. 99mTc (V) DMSA scintigrams were interpreted blindly with respect to
clinical information, and radiotracer uptake in the bowel segments was graded.
The findings were then compared with the results of the colonoscopy and
colonoscopic biopsy.
RESULTS: In the detection of intestinal inflammation, findings at 99mTc (V) DMSA 
scintigraphy were as follows: true-positive in 55, false-positive in two,
true-negative in 32, and false-negative in three. Overall sensitivity was 95%;
overall specificity, 94%; and overall accuracy, 95%.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that 99mTc (V) DMSA scintigraphy is a useful
noninvasive diagnostic test for the detection and localization of intestinal
inflammation.

Radioisotope-guided surgery in patients with pheochromocytoma and recurrent
medullary thyroid carcinoma: a comparison of preoperative and intraoperative
tumor localization with histopathologic findings.

Adams S(1), Acker P, Lorenz M, Staib-Sebler E, Hör G.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Medical
Center, Frankfurt/Main, Germany. adams@em.uni-frankfurt.de

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to appraise the detection of
metastases of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pheochromocytoma using
radioguided surgery (RGS) and to compare the results with external imaging
modalities, surgical palpation, and histopathologic findings.
METHODS: Twenty-five patients with recurrent MTC underwent preoperative
scintigraphic imaging with 500 megabecquerels (MBq) of technetium
99m(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid [(99m)Tc(V)-DMSA] and 222 MBq of indium 111
((111)In)-pentetreotide. The radiopharmaceutical that showed the greatest
preoperative tumor uptake was selected for intraoperative RGS. Surgery was
performed 24 hours after the administration of (111)In-pentetreotide or 4 hours
after the injection of (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA. Furthermore, three male patients
underwent surgery who suffered from recurrent pheochromocytoma (injection of 180 
MBq iodine 123-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine [(123)I-MIBG] 4--5 hours before
surgery).
RESULTS: Overall, lesion detection sensitivities in patients with MTC for
computed tomography, (111)In-pentetreotide, and (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA were 32%, 34%,
and 65%, respectively. Surgical palpation identified lymph node metastases of
recurrent MTC with a sensitivity of 65%, whereas RGS localized 64 malignant
lesions (sensitivity, 97%). Altogether, 71 lesions could be excised, 5 of which
were adjudged false positive with respect to MTC metastases. Both surgical
palpation and RGS localized all paravertebral subdiaphragmatic lesions (size > or
= 2 cm) of recurrent pheochromocytoma seen in the preoperative MIBG scan.
CONCLUSIONS: RGS was capable of localizing more and smaller metastases of MTC
compared with conventional imaging modalities and surgical palpation. However,
the relatively high radioligand accumulation in the kidneys
((111)In-pentetreotide) and the dense hepatic and biliary signals using MIBG
limited their use for intraoperative detection of tumors in the area of the
adrenal gland.

Reflux nephropathy in infancy: a comparison of infants presenting with and
without urinary tract infection.

Sweeney B(1), Cascio S, Velayudham M, Puri P.

Author information: 
(1)Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin,
Ireland.

PURPOSE: We compared the incidence of renal scarring in infants with high grade
vesicoureteral reflux in those presenting with and without urinary tract
infection.
METHODS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 81 male and 46 female
infants (194 renal refluxing units) with a mean age of 4 months who had grade IV 
or V primary vesicoureteral reflux and underwent an anti-reflux procedure between
1984 and 1997. Dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scans and voiding
cystourethrography were performed in all cases. Patients were followed for 2 to
16 years, including 90% for greater than 3 years. Renal ultrasound and DMSA scan 
were done at followup.
RESULTS: A total of 97 patients (76%) (148 refluxing renal units) presented
clinically with urinary tract infection. The initial DMSA scan demonstrated renal
scarring in 40 of the 106 grade IV (38%) and 28 of the 42 grade V (67%) refluxing
renal units. There was no scarring on followup in previously normal refluxing
renal units. Of the patients 30 (24%) (46 refluxing renal units) were diagnosed
before a urinary tract infection developed, 16 underwent screening due to
vesicoureteral reflux in a sibling and in 10 reflux was initially suspected due
to hydronephrosis on prenatal ultrasound. In the remaining 4 patients
vesicoureteral reflux was suspected during abdominal ultrasound to investigate
abdominal pain, jaundice, associated hypospadias and fetal alcohol syndrome,
respectively. DMSA scan showed evidence of scarring in 6 of 21 grade IV (29%) and
9 of 25 grade V (36%) refluxing renal units in this group. Followup revealed
scarring in only 1 previously normal refluxing renal unit.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of reflux nephropathy in primary grade V
vesicoureteral reflux is lower in cases detected by screening and with treatment 
it remained lower than in cases of urinary tract infection that presented
clinically. Early treatment of grade V vesicoureteral reflux made possible by
screening may prevent renal damage.

Comparison of In-111 octreotide and Tc-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy in the detection
of medullary thyroid tumor foci in patients with elevated levels of tumor markers
after surgery.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Gülhane Military Medical Academy and Medical
Faculty, Ankara, Turkey. nuria@gata.edu.tr

PURPOSE: In this retrospective study, the authors evaluated the utility of In-111
octreotide (OctreoScan) and Tc-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy for the localization of 
recurrent metastatic tumor foci in patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)
and compared the findings with those of conventional radiologic imaging methods.
METHODS: The scintigraphic images were compared with computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography (US) in 14 patients (8 men, 
6 women; age range, 22 to 74 years) with elevated calcitonin and carcinoembryonic
antigen levels after total thyroidectomy. All scintigraphic image findings were
evaluated qualitatively as mild uptake (+) and moderate to marked uptake (++).
RESULTS: In-111 octreotide may be superior to Tc-99m (V) DMSA for the detection
of tumor foci of patients with MTC on a patient basis (78.5% versus 57.1%) and on
a lesion basis (44.1% versus 30.2%). The sensitivity rate for In-111 octreotide
(78.5%) was also similar to that of CT and MRI on a patient basis. Conversely,
the combined use of Tc-99m (V) DMSA and In-111 octreotide revealed the best
sensitivity rate (85.7%) on a patient basis, whereas the combined use of CT and
MRI showed the best sensitivity rate (81.3%) on a lesion basis.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that In-111 octreotide is superior to Tc-99m 
(V) DMSA and has a similar sensitivity rate to CT and MRI for the diagnosis of
recurrent or metastatic MTC. Although the combined use of In-111 octreotide and
Tc-99m (V) DMSA was most sensitive, the combined use of CT and MRI with
radionuclide imaging methods may better detect more metastatic tumor foci.

Oral succimer decreases the gastrointestinal absorption of lead in juvenile
monkeys.

Cremin JD Jr(1), Luck ML, Laughlin NK, Smith DR.

Author information: 
(1)Environmental Toxicology, University of California, Santa Cruz, California,
USA.

Although succimer (Chemet, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA) is considered 
to be a safe and effective chelating agent for the treatment of lead poisoning in
humans, there is concern that it may increase the gastrointestinal (GI)
absorption and retention of Pb from exposures suffered concurrent with treatment.
This concern is justified because the availability of Pb-safe housing during
outpatient treatment with oral succimer is limited. We used a juvenile nonhuman
primate model of moderate childhood Pb intoxication and a sensitive double stable
Pb isotope tracer methodology to determine whether oral succimer chelation
affects the GI absorption and whole-body retention of Pb. Infant rhesus monkeys
(n = 17) were exposed to Pb daily for 1 year postpartum to reach and maintain a
target blood lead (BPb) level of 35-40 microg/dL. Animals were administered
succimer (n = 9) or vehicle (n = 8) over two successive 19 day succimer treatment
regimens beginning at 53 and 65 weeks of age. The present study was conducted
over the second chelation regimen only. Animals received a single intravenous
(iv) dose of stable (204)Pb tracer (5 microg, 24.5 nmol) followed by a single
oral dose of stable (206)Pb tracer (72.6 microg, 352 nmol) immediately before
chelation, in order to specifically evaluate GI Pb absorption and whole-body Pb
retention with treatment. We collected complete urine and fecal samples over the 
first 5 days and whole blood over the first 8 days of treatment for analyses of
stable Pb isotopes using magnetic sector inductively-coupled plasma mass
spectrometry. Results indicate that succimer significantly reduced the GI
absorption of Pb (vehicle, 64.9% +/- 5.5; succimer, 37.0% +/- 5.8; mean +/- SEM).
Succimer also significantly increased the urinary excretion of endogenous Pb by
approximately 4-fold over the vehicle treatment, while endogenous fecal Pb
excretion was decreased by approximately 33%. Finally, although succimer reduced 
the whole-body retention of endogenous Pb by approximately 10% compared to
vehicle, the majority (77%) of the administered internal dose of Pb tracer was
retained in the body when assessed after 5 days of treatment. These data do not
support the concern that succimer treatment increases GI Pb absorption.

A digital radioimager (RI), conventional radioautography (RA), and tracks
microradioautography (MRA) were used to assess the biodistributions and kinetics 
of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic (99mTc-DMSA) and 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine
(99mTc-MAG3) in rat at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Three groups of
male Wistar rats were studied. Using gamma-counting, kidney, liver, spleen and
blood kinetics of both tracers were assessed in the three groups. Using RA and
RI, renal slices were analyzed in group 1 the animals being sacrified from 2 to
60 min after injection of 99mTc-MAG3, and in group 2 the animals being sacrificed
from 0.5 to 24 hr after injection of 99mTc-DMSA. Using MRA, renal slices were
analyzed for 99mTc-DMSA (group 3). RA films and RI images displayed the variation
with time of the cortical and medullary uptakes of the tracers. No regional
heterogeneity within the different structures could be seen neither with RA films
nor with MRA. The remaining activity in the blood 24 hr after injection of
99mTc-DMSA was evaluated. The tissular distributions of both tracer being
homogenous, mean values of cortical uptake seems to be acceptable for dosimetric 
studies. Our results incite to use of 99mTc-MAG3 instead of 99mTc-DMSA when both 
tracers may be indicated.

Role of Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy in the diagnosis of culture negative
pyelonephritis.

Belgium.

The aim of this work was to evaluate prospectively the proportion of children
with a clinical and biological presentation of acute pyelonephritis, abnormal
Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy and negative or equivocal
urine cultures. All patients aged 6 weeks to 15 years suspected of acute
pyelonephritis (APN) were admitted to the Paediatric Department and underwent
Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy within 3 days after admission and at 6 months. Of 166
patients enrolled in the study, 15 (9%) had negative or equivocal urine culture
despite clinical and scintigraphic evidence of APN. Of these 15 children, renal
ultrasound was normal in 7 patients and vesicoureteric reflux was found in 9
patients. Control DMSA 6 months after acute episode showed the disappearance of
cortical lesions in eight and partial improvement in four patients. In this
prospective series, as many as 9% of patients with APN would have been missed on 
the basis of equivocal or negative urine cultures. It is suggested that Tc-99m
DMSA scintigraphy should be performed in children with severe infection without
clear aetiology, especially in those with abnormal urinalysis.

The use of renal scintigraphy in assessing the potential for recovery in the
obstructed renal tract in children.

Pendlebury, Manchester, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of renal scintigraphy with
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in predicting functional recovery after the 
surgical relief of obstructed kidneys in children. Patients and methods
Forty-three children underwent surgery to relieve upper urinary tract
obstruction; 37 had pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction and six had
vesico-ureteric junction obstruction. The indication for surgery was a
combination of an obstructed renogram with symptoms of either pain or
pyelonephritis. Most children (41) had < 40% function on the affected side before
surgery, with just two having hyperfunction (> 55%). In all patients intravenous 
urography before surgery showed hydronephrosis, and a micturating cystogram was
used to exclude coexisting reflux in the presence of an associated megaureter.
Diuretic renography (using 99mTc-mercaptoacetyl triglycine or 123I-hippuran) and 
DMSA scintigraphy were both carried out before surgery and the renography
repeated 6 months afterward.
RESULTS: The renographic drainage curves improved from obstructed to unobstructed
or 'dilated unobstructed' on all postoperative studies. Regression analysis
showed that preoperative DMSA scan was an excellent predictor of outcome (P <
0.001) whilst the preoperative renogram was a relatively poor predictor of the
functional result. In four patients where the initial renographic function was < 
10%, DMSA scintigraphy predicted correctly the capacity for recovery in three and
the inability to improve in the fourth. Conclusion Before surgery, DMSA
scintigraphy in children with upper urinary tract obstruction is a more useful
estimate of probable long-term renal function than value from diuresis
renography. If there is doubt about the desirability of reconstructive surgery, a
DMSA scan may eliminate the need for more invasive methods of estimating
recovery, e.g. a period of nephrostomy drainage.

Simple and reliable preparation of pentavalent 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid at
alkaline pH without oxygen bubbling.

We investigated a simple and reliable method for the preparation of
99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99Tcm(V)-DMSA) without the addition of oxygen. The
effect of pH, amount of reducing agent, and oxygen addition in the synthesis of
99Tcm(V)-DMSA were evaluated. At pH 9, we obtained a radiochemical yield of 95%
+/- 1.2% within 10 min and a high stability until 7 h, with 92% +/- 1.5%
radiochemical purity. However, at a pH lower than 9, the radiochemical yield was 
below 90% within 10 min, and a longer reaction time was needed to obtain a
radiochemical yield above 90%. The addition of oxygen did not have an additional 
effect on the radiochemical yield or its stability at pH 9, whereas it increased 
the radiochemical yield of 99Tcm-(V)-DMSA at pH 7. It was noted that the smaller 
the amount of reducing agent used, the higher was the radiochemical yield
obtained at pH 7. However, at pH 9, the radiochemical yield was not dependent on 
the amount of reducing agent. In conclusion, the synthesis of 99Tcm(V)-DMSA was
more dependent on the pH of the reaction mixture than on the amount of reducing
agent or the addition of oxygen. The adjustment of pH 9 was the easiest and most 
effective method for the synthesis of 99Tcm(V)-DMSA using a commercial kit for
99Tcm(III)-DMSA.

Study of the toxicological effect of mitomycin C in mice: alteration on the
biodistribution of radiopharmaceuticals used for renal evaluations.

Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

Mitomycin C (MMC) has been used as a component of many chemotherapeutic regimens 
and some toxic effects of this substance have been reported. As it has been
reported that the toxicological effect of a drug can alter the biodistribution of
radiopharmaceuticals and because patients on chemotherapeutic treatment can be
submitted to a nuclear medicine procedure, we investigated whether MMC could
affect the uptake of various technetium-99m (99mTc) radiopharmaceuticals used for
renal evaluations. The purpose of this study was to suggest a model to evaluate
the toxic effect of substances in specific organs. Three doses of MMC (0.45 mg)
were administered to mice (N=15). One hour after the last dose, 99mTc
radiopharmaceuticals, 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA),
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) or 99mTc-glucoheptonic acid
(99mTc-GHA), with activity of 7.4 MBq, were also administered in the treated
group and in the control group (N=15). After another 0.5 h, the animals were
sacrificed. The organs were isolated, the 99mTc radiopharmaceutical uptake in the
organs quantified in a well counter and the percentages of radioactivity (%ATI)
calculated. The results have shown that: (i) with 99mTc-DTPA, the %ATI increased 
in the pancreas, ovary, uterus, stomach, kidney, spleen, thymus, heart, lung,
liver, thyroid and bone; (ii) with 99mTc-DMSA, the %ATI decreased in all the
organs except for the brain; and (iii) with 99mTc-GHA, the %ATI increased in the 
liver and decreased in the stomach, thymus, heart and thyroid. The effects of
this chemotherapeutic drug on the biodistribution of these radiopharmaceuticals
were statistically significant (Wilcoxon test, p<0.05) and could be explained by 
the metabolization and/or therapeutic action of MMC. Studies with other
radiopharmaceuticals are in progress.

Investigation of Escherichia coli dimethyl sulfoxide reductase assembly and
processing in strains defective for the sec-independent protein translocation
system membrane targeting and translocation.

Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2H7, Canada.

Dimethyl sulfoxide reductase is a heterotrimeric enzyme (DmsABC) localized to the
cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane. Targeting of the DmsA and DmsB
catalytic subunits to the membrane requires the membrane targeting and
translocation (Mtt) system. The DmsAB dimer is a member of a family of extrinsic,
cytoplasmic facing membrane subunits that require Mtt in order to assemble on the
membrane. We show that the MttA(2), MttB, and presumably MttA(1) but not the MttC
proteins are required for targeting DmsAB to the membrane. Unlike other Mtt
substrates such as trimethylamine N-oxide reductase, the soluble cytoplasmic
DmsAB dimer that accumulates in the mtt deletions is very labile. Deletion of the
mttA(2) or mttB genes also prevents anaerobic growth on fumarate even though
fumarate reductase does not require Mtt for assembly. This was due to the
lethality of membrane insertion of DmsC in the absence of the DmsAB subunits. In 
the absence of DmsC, DmsAB accumulates in the cytoplasm. A 45-amino acid leader
on DmsA is removed during assembly. Processing does not require DmsC but does
require Mtt. Translocation of DmsAB to the periplasm is not required for
processing. The leader may be cleaved by a novel leader peptidase, or the long
DmsA leader may traverse the membrane through the Mtt system resulting in
cleavage by the periplasmic leader peptidase I followed by release of DmsA into
the cytoplasm.

scan in the paediatric population?

Determination of the left to right dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake ratio is
theoretically one of the easiest quantitative procedures in nuclear medicine. The
quantification can be performed on the posterior view, with or without the
lateral view for correction of kidney depth. The geometric mean can also be
determined using both the anterior and the posterior views. The aim of this study
was to evaluate the occurrence of remarkable differences in the results from
quantification of the relative renal function using the geometric mean and those 
obtained using the posterior counts only. Moreover, we evaluated to what extent
the patient age influenced these differences. We reviewed 328 99Tcm-DMSA scans.
The difference between the relative renal function obtained using the posterior
view and that obtained using the geometric mean was calculated and analysed
statistically. For the purpose of evaluating the value of performing the
geometric mean calculation in patients of different ages, patients were divided
into four age groups (group I, < or =2 years; group II, 3-9 years; group III,
10-18 years; group IV, >18 years). Using the Student's t test, no statistical
differences were found in the relative renal function obtained by the two methods
(posterior projection and geometric mean) in groups I (t = 0.01, P = 0.992) and
II (t = 1.43, P = 0.155), which consisted of patients younger than 10 years (77% 
of the patients). In groups III and IV statistical differences were found (t =
2.27, P = 0.028 and t = 2.170, P = 0.038), respectively. We conclude that for
children under 10 years it is unnecessary to perform depth correction using the
geometric mean except in rare cases of major malformations and position
anomalies.

Scintigraphy and Doppler ultrasonography for the evaluation of obstructive
urinary calculi.

(1)Divisão de Nefrologia, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de
São Paulo, Rua Botucatu, 740, 04023-900 São Paulo, SP, Brazil.

Forty-seven patients with unilateral obstructive calculi (12 males and 35
females) were submitted to 99mTc-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) or
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans for assessment of renal function. The 
scans revealed unilateral functional deficit in 68 and 66% of the patients,
respectively. A calculus size of 1.1 to 2.0 cm was significantly associated with 
deficit detected by DTPA, but duration of obstruction and calculus localization
were not. After relief of the obstruction, the mean percent renal function of the
affected kidney was found to be significantly increased from 25 +/- 12% to 29 +/-
12% in DTPA and from 21 +/- 15% to 24 +/- 12% in DMSA. Initial Doppler
ultrasonography performed in 35 patients detected an increased resistive index in
10 (29%). In the remaining patients with a normal resistive index, ureteral
urinary jet was observed, indicating partial obstruction. The high frequency of
renal function impairment detected by DTPA and of tubulointerstitial damage
detected by DMSA as well as the slight amelioration of unilateral renal function 
after relief of obstruction suggest that scintigraphy assessment may help
evaluate the unilateral percentage of renal function and monitor renal function
recovery when it occurs. The presence of a urinary jet detected by Doppler
ultrasonography further indicates the severity of obstruction and the recovery
prognosis.

Role of nuclear medicine in the diagnosis and therapy of medullary thyroid
carcinoma.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) originates in the parafollicular cells (C
cells) of the thyroid, secreting both calcitonin and CEA. Genetic and biochemical
testing allow early pre-clinical identification of familial forms. Sporadic MTC
usually presents as a solitary palpable thyroid nodule and in most cases the
definitive diagnosis is established only at the time of surgery. Nuclear medicine
procedures, which play a minor role in the preoperative evaluation of MTC, are
essential in postoperative follow-up to detect residual and/or recurrent tumor. A
number of radiopharmaceuticals are able to visualize MTC lesions with
considerable advantages in diagnosis and prognosis, some of them having also a
therapeutic role. Among them, 99mTc[V]DMSA shows the highest diagnostic
sensitivity and is considered by many authors the radiopharmaceutical of choice
in the postoperative work-up of MTC. Radioiodinated MIBG, in spite of its high
specificity has a poor sensitivity (30%); however it is useful for the
identification of pheochromocytoma and, in patients showing MIBG uptake in
tumoral lesions, high activities of 131I-MIBG may be used for therapy. 111In
labeled octreotide detects lesions which express somatostatin receptors; a
positive scintigraphic result seems to give also prognostic information (higher
uptake in slow-growing lesions) and provides the basis for treatment with
octreotide or lanreotide and 111In or 90Y-labeled octreotide analogues.
Interesting perspectives are offered by 18F-FDG PET and monoclonal anti-CEA
labeled antibodies; the latter may be also used for therapy.

Role of beta 2-microglobulinuria and microalbuminuria in pediatric febrile
urinary tract infection.

Chiou YY(1), Chiu NT, Chen MJ, Cheng HL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, National Cheng Kung University Hospital and College 
of Medicine, Tainan, Taiwan. yuanyow@mail.ncku.edu.tw

Urinary beta-2-microglobulin (beta 2M) and microalbumin concentrations were
analyzed in 61 pediatric patients with febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). The
results were compared with those of technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic
acid (99mTc-DMSA) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging.
Noninvasive evaluations were made to localize the site of the UTI. Increased
urinary beta 2M/Creatinine (Cr) or microalbumin/Cr quotients were not associated 
with renal inflammation, as defined by a positive renal scan. Increased urinary
microalbumin/Cr is associated with UTI in febrile patients regardless of the
level of infection (scan status), and may be an informative indicator of UTI.
When microalbumin/Cr was > or = 0.03, its sensitivity and specificity to predict 
UTI in febrile patients, regardless of the site of the infection, were 95.65% and
51.79%, respectively, and its positive predictive value was 62.0%. On the other
hand, urinary beta 2M/Cr (> or = 0.13) demonstrates a statistically significant
correlation with the presentation of a high grade of vesicoureteral reflux (p =
0.02). We suggest that a prompt renal imaging study is warranted when the urinary
beta 2M/Cr ratio is high (> or = 0.13).

KC.

Hospital, University of Ioannina Medical School, Ioannina, Greece.

PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to determine individual renal function in
patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors initially examined (study t1) 25 patients with
ADPKD (12 female, 13 male; ages 18 to 68 years). The serum creatinine
concentration and glomerular filtration rate, measured by Tc-99m DTPA, were 1.5
+/- 0.56 mg/dl and 65.7 +/- 31 ml.minute-1.1.73 m2, respectively. Thirteen
patients had a follow-up study (t2) 2 years after their initial evaluations.
Individual renal function was assessed on Tc-99m DMSA renal scans.
RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) difference between left kidney DMSA (DMSA-L) and right
kidney DMSA (DMSA-R) was 7.04 % +/- 16.48%. In 20 patients (80%), the left kidney
had a lower percentage contribution to the total renal function compared with the
right kidney. When the results of the two studies were compared, deterioration in
renal function was noted. In the t1 study, the mean serum creatinine
concentration and glomerular filtration rate were 1.7 mg/dl and 67.02
ml.minute-1.1.73 m2 respectively, and in the t2 study these values were 2.01
mg/dl and 57.15 ml.minute-1.1.73 m2, respectively. No difference, however, was
found in individual renal function in the two studies.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ADPKD, the percentage contribution of each kidney
to total renal function is not equal and remains stable during the progression of
renal failure.

    J Urol. 2003 Jul;170(1):324-5.

BACKGROUND: Nephropathy associated with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and urinary
tract infection can result in end-stage renal failure, hypertension, or both.
Whether long-term VUR contributes to these outcomes is unknown. We compared, in a
randomised trial, medical with surgical management of children with bilateral
severe VUR and bilateral nephropathy.
METHODS: We stratified by age and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 25 boys and 27
girls aged 1-12 years and randomly assigned them to medical or surgical
management. At enrolment and 4 years' follow-up we estimated GFR from the plasma 
clearance of 51Cr-labelled edetic acid (EDTA), and did intravenous urography. We 
also did a metastable 99mTc-labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) assay and
contrast cystography. The change in GFR at 4 years, expressed as a percentage
change between enrolment and 4 years, was available for 26 of 27 patients in the 
medical and 24 of 25 in the surgical group. We assessed GFR in 48 patients 10
years after enrolment.
FINDINGS: Mean GFR at enrolment was 72.4 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (SD 24.1) in the
medical and 71.7 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (22.6) in the surgical group. The mean
percentage change in GFR at 4 years was 2.4% (SE 4.5) versus 4.7% (5.0) in the
medical and surgical groups, respectively. The difference in change in GFR at 4
years between the two groups was not significant (7.1%, 95% CI 6.4% to 20.6%).
INTERPRETATION: Our data do not lend support to the view that the outcome for
renal function is improved by surgical correction of VUR in children with
bilateral disease.

Interobserver reproducibility in reporting on 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy for
detection of late renal sequelae.

Ladron De Guevara D(1), Franken P, De Sadeleer C, Ham H, Piepsz A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hospital San Juan de Dios, Santiago, Chile.

This study was designed to evaluate the interobserver variability in reporting on
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning performed 6 mo after an acute
episode of pyelonephritis for the detection of late renal sequelae.METHODS:
Forty-six children were selected, who had early and late DMSA studies for
evaluation of acute pyelonephritic lesions as well as sequelae. Three observers
reported independently and separately on the early and late DMSA scans and, in a 
second step, on the late scan in the presence of the early scan. Interobserver
reproducibility was evaluated for the early DMSA scan, the late DMSA scan alone, 
and the late DMSA scan with the early scan for comparison.
RESULTS: Complete agreement between the three observers was reached in 75%, 78%, 
and 77% for the early DMSA scan, the late DMSA scan alone, and the late DMSA scan
with the early scan for comparison, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Interobserver reproducibility was high and was comparable for both
early and late DMSA scintigraphy.

Associations of blood pressure and hypertension with lead dose measures and
polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase
genes.

Evidence suggests that lead and selected genes known to modify the toxicokinetics
of lead--namely, those for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and delta-aminolevulinic 
acid dehydratase (ALAD)--may independently influence blood pressure and
hypertension risk. We report the relations among ALAD and VDR genotypes, three
lead dose measures, and blood pressure and hypertension status in 798 Korean lead
workers and 135 controls without occupational exposure to lead. Lead dose was
assessed by blood lead, tibia lead measured by X-ray fluorescence, and
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)-chelatable lead. Among lead workers, 9.9% (n = 79)
were heterozygous for the ALAD(2) allele, and there were no ALAD(2) homozygotes; 
11.2% (n = 89) had at least one copy of the VDR B allele, and 0.5% (n = 4) had
the BB genotype. In linear regression models to control for covariates, VDR
genotype (BB and Bb vs. bb), blood lead, tibia lead, and DMSA-chelatable lead
were all positive predictors of systolic blood pressure. On average, lead workers
with the VDR B allele, mainly heterozygotes, had systolic blood pressures that
were 2.7-3.7 mm Hg higher than did workers with the bb genotype. VDR genotype was
also associated with diastolic blood pressure; on average, lead workers with the 
VDR B allele had diastolic blood pressures that were 1.9-2.5 mm Hg higher than
did lead workers with the VDR bb genotype (p = 0.04). VDR genotype modified the
relation of age with systolic blood pressure; compared to lead workers with the
VDR bb genotype, workers with the VDR B allele had larger elevations in blood
pressure with increasing age. Lead workers with the VDR B allele also had a
higher prevalence of hypertension compared to lead workers with the bb genotype
[adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 2.1 (1.0, 4.4), p = 0.05]. None 
of the lead biomarkers was associated with diastolic blood pressure, and tibia
lead was the only lead dose measure that was a significant predictor of
hypertension status. In contrast to VDR, ALAD genotype was not associated with
the blood pressure measures and did not modify associations of the lead dose
measures with any of the blood pressure measures. To our knowledge, these are the
first data to suggest that the common genetic polymorphism in the VDR is
associated with blood pressure and hypertension risk. We speculate that the BsmI 
polymorphism may be in linkage disequilibrium with another functional variant at

PURPOSE: The author's goal was to create a system to identify children at risk
for development of progressive renal damage.
METHODS: Thirty-four children were examined with Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy in the 
acute stage of an initial episode of pyelonephritis, after 6 months, and again
after 1 year. The scintigraphic findings were correlated with clinical and
laboratory data.
RESULTS: All children had parenchymal defects in the acute stage: 93% of the
kidneys and 85% bilaterally. After 6 months, the defects had diminished or
disappeared in 66% of the kidneys. New defects appeared in 22%. At 1 year, no
further improvement was seen in the kidneys, with an improved or unchanged
pattern at 6 months. New defects appeared in 34%. Mean kidney activity uptake
expressed as the percentage of administered dose (KU/AD), was low in the acute
stage, increased at 6 months, with no further significant increase at 1 year.
Eighty-three percent of children with urine cultures growing > or = 104
bacteria/ml at follow-up had decreased KU/AD values, whereas all children with
urine cultures growing < 104 bacteria/ml had increased KU/AD values.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative assessment increases the sensitivity of Tc-99m DMSA
scintigraphy. Follow-up with this method makes it possible to identify the
children with decreasing renal tubular function who may be at risk for
progressive renal damage. Moderate bacteruria of 104 bacteria/ml urine is
associated with deterioration of renal tubular function.

Identification of a twin-arginine leader-binding protein.

Oresnik IJ(1), Ladner CL, Turner RJ.

Author information:

University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 1N4, Canada.

The transport and targeting of a number of periplasmic proteins is carried out by
the Sec-independent Mtt (also referred to as Tat) protein translocase. Proteins
using this translocase have a distinct twin-arginine-containing leader. We
hypothesized that specific leader-binding proteins exist to escort proteins to
the translocase complex. A fusion was constructed with the twin-arginine leader
from dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) reductase, subunit DmsA, to the N-terminus of
glutathione-S-transferase. This leader fusion was bound to a glutathione affinity
column through which an Escherichia coli anaerobic cell-free extract was passed. 
Proteins that bound to the leader were then separated and identified by
N-terminal sequencing, which identified DnaK and a protein originating from the
uncharacterized reading frame ynfI. This gene has been designated dmsD based on
the findings presented in this paper. DmsD was purified as a His6 fusion and was 
shown to interact with preprotein forms of DmsA and TorA (trimethyl amine N-oxide
reductase). A strain carrying a dmsD knock-out mutation showed a loss of
anaerobic growth on glycerol-DMSO medium and reduced growth on glycerol-fumarate 
medium. This work suggests that DmsD is a twin-arginine leader-binding protein.

ureteral obstruction.

Khoury AE.

Author information:

Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario.

This study is designed to evaluate the relative ability of DMSA and DTPA renal
scans to accurately reflect differential renal function (DRF) compared with
inulin clearance in the presence of partial unilateral ureteral obstruction. DRF 
was determined in 29 young rabbits by both renal scans. In the experimental group
(n=21), left partial ureteral obstruction was created. Following 8 to 24 weeks,
individual renal function in the obstructed animals were assessed by both renal
scans and clearance of inulin. Eight animals were used as control. In the control
group, DRF measured by DMSA, but not DTPA, correlated well with inulin clearance.
Both scans documented a significant change in the DRF of the obstructed group
(p<0.001). In the partially obstructed kidneys DRF derived by inulin was
significantly lower than that measured by DMSA or DTPA scans (p<0.001 and
p<0.0001). DRF measured by DMSA correlates well with inulin clearance in the
control group. A similar correlation was not obtained by DMSA in the presence of 
obstruction. DTPA does not correlate with inulin clearance either in the control 
or the obstructed group.

High-pressure bladder: an underlying factor mediating renal damage in the absence
of reflux?

Vega-P JM(1), Pascual LA.

Author information: 
(1)Urology Section, Hospital Pediatrico de Mendoza, Argentina.

Comment in
    J Urol. 2003 Apr;169(4):1602.

OBJECTIVE: To assess urodynamic studies of children with nonrefluxing
pyelonephritis, investigate the possible connection between renal damage (as
approximately 40% of children with febrile urinary tract infections and no
evidence of vesico-ureteric reflux have irreversible renal cortical scarring) and
lower urinary tract dysfunction, to test the hypothesis that bladders with high
storage and voiding pressures may be the cause of renal damage in these patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical records and urodynamic studies of 52 children 
(46 girls and six boys, mean age 6.6 years) with febrile urinary infections, no
evidence of reflux and photopenic areas on renal scintigraphy were evaluated
retrospectively. Each child was evaluated by urinary ultrasonography, a voiding
cystogram, 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and urodynamic studies. The 
storage phase of the urodynamic study was divided into two equal segments to
consider the filling variables of each. During the emptying phase, voiding
pressures and voiding pressures with reference to peak detrusor contraction were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Despite no child having reflux, the DMSA scans showed bilateral renal
scarring in 39 (75%) and unilateral scarring in the remaining children.
Forty-eight (93%) children had abnormal urodynamic values: high filling pressures
(34), high-pressure uninhibited contractions (32), high voiding pressures (31)
and discoordinated voiding (28). The cystometric bladder capacity was lower than 
the expected bladder capacity (- 75 mL) in 82% of the patients; in only four
patients were the urodynamics considered normal.
CONCLUSIONS: Most children with renal scarring and no reflux had lower urinary
tract dysfunction. Common findings include high storage and voiding pressures,
and discoordinated voiding. These findings suggest that abnormal bladder dynamics
play a role in the development of renal scars that occur in the absence of
reflux.

    BJU Int. 2002 May;89(7):792-3; author reply 793.

OBJECTIVE: To define prospectively the incidence of renal parenchymal lesions in 
the siblings of patients treated at one institution for primary vesico-ureteric
reflux (VUR).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1997 to October 1998, a prospective study
including renal scintigraphy (using dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA) and a
radionuclide cystogram was proposed systematically to the asymptomatic siblings
of children treated for primary VUR. The radionuclide cystograms were interpreted
as showing the presence or absence of VUR and the DMSA scan as symmetrical or
asymmetrical differential function, with or with no renal defect.
RESULTS: Fifty-five families gave informed consent, of whom 46 completed the
study (eight refused secondarily and one was omitted by exclusion criteria),
representing 46 symptomatic patients and 65 siblings. There were 17 siblings with
VUR (26%) including two of 13 infants and 15 of 52 children aged > 18 months. One
radionuclide cystogram failed. Of the 17 refluxing siblings, four had a history
of symptomatic urinary tract infection; 62 of the 65 siblings had a DMSA scan, of
which 56 were normal and six (10%) showed abnormalities (five asymmetrical
differential function and one parenchymal defect). Only one of these six patients
had VUR at the time of the evaluation and only one had a small kidney detected by
ultrasonography on one side (and no VUR). There were no adverse effects
associated with screening.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms a significant overall incidence of VUR (26%) in
the asymptomatic siblings of patients treated for primary VUR. From the results
of the DMSA scan (only one sibling had a parenchymal defect), the systematic
screening of asymptomatic siblings does not appear to be beneficial.

Comment in
    Pediatr Radiol. 2002 Mar;32(3):212-3.

Two neonates were found on US to have branching linear calcification in the renal
parenchyma, right sided in one and bilateral in the other. CT confirmed the
presence of branching calcification in the kidneys and demonstrated calcified
thrombus in the inferior vena cava in both babies. Antenatal detection of adrenal
haemorrhage in one baby and presence of calcification at the age of 3 days in the
other indicate that thrombosis probably occurred before birth. The kidneys
remained normal in size, and uptake of 99mTc-labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc-DMSA) was normal on follow-up examination. The presence of branching
calcification and normal renal size probably indicates good prognosis for renal
function in neonates in whom renal venous thrombosis is found and may indicate
prenatal thrombosis.

Combined administration of a chelating agent and an antioxidant in the prevention
and treatment of acute lead intoxication in rats.

The administration of chelating agents, meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 
monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA) either individually or in combination with an
antioxidant, n-acetylcysteine (NAC) in the prevention and treatment of acute lead
intoxication in rats, was investigated. The results suggest that concomitant oral
supplementation of DMSA with lead was most effective in preventing the inhibition
of lead sensitive blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity in 
blood, elevation of zinc protoporphyrin level and the alterations in hepatic
reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG) contents. A number of other
biochemical variables either remained insensitive to lead exposure or responded
moderately to chelation treatment. Combined administrations of NAC plus DMSA was 
most effective when given during lead exposure or post exposure, followed by DMSA
and MiADMSA alone or NAC plus MiADMSA treatment, in reducing the accumulation of 
lead in blood and liver. Administration of NAC alone was only mildly effective in
preventing lead absorption in the blood and tissues. The results suggest that
combined administration of DMSA and NAC could be a more effective treatment
protocol for acute lead toxicity, keeping in view its beneficial effect on
oxidative injury.

99mTc-DMSA absolute uptake: normal pediatric values at 2-4 hours.

Moorin R(1).

Author information: 
(1)Nuclear Medicine, Perth Radiological Clinic, Perth, Western Australia.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine if normal absolute uptake values of
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) can be predicted accurately over the optimal time 
for imaging.
METHODS: Eighty-eight normal kidneys were analyzed from 44 children with a median
age of 4 y. The mean time between injection and scan was 171.7 min. The absolute 
uptake of DMSA in milligrams was calculated for each kidney.
RESULTS: A strong positive linear relationship was found between the absolute
uptake of DMSA and the amount of DMSA injected in milligrams (corr = 0.940 [P<
0.0005]), and the age of the child (corr = 0.770 (P<0.0005)). Multiple linear
regression showed that these 2 factors accounted for 92.2% of the change in
absolute DMSA uptake.
CONCLUSION: The absolute uptake of DMSA can be accurately predicted using a
linear regression equation incorporating the amount of DMSA injected in
milligrams and the patient's age. Time between injection and scan appears to play
little role in the absolute uptake of DMSA over 2-4 h.

Diagnostic chelation challenge with DMSA: a biomarker of long-term mercury
exposure?

Chelation challenge testing has been used to assess the body burden of various
metals. The best-known example is EDTA challenge in lead-exposed individuals.
This study assessed diagnostic chelation challenge with dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) as a measure of mercury body burden among mercury-exposed workers. Former 
employees at a chloralkali plant, for whom detailed exposure histories were
available (n = 119), and unexposed controls (n = 101) completed 24-hr urine
collections before and after the administration of two doses of DMSA, 10 mg/kg.
The urinary response to DMSA was measured as both the absolute change and the
relative change in mercury excretion. The average 24-hr mercury excretion was 4.3
microg/24 hr before chelation, and 7.8 microg/24 hr after chelation. There was no
association between past occupational mercury exposure and the urinary excretion 
of mercury either before or after DMSA administration. There was also no
association between urinary mercury excretion and the number of dental amalgam
surfaces, in contrast to recent published results. We believe the most likely
reason that DMSA chelation challenge failed to reflect past mercury exposure was 
the elapsed time (several years) since the exposure had ended. These results
provide normative values for urinary mercury excretion both before and after DMSA
challenge, and suggest that DMSA chelation challenge is not useful as a biomarker
of past mercury exposure.

Attitude of Belgian pediatricians toward strategy in acute pyelonephritis.

Levtchenko EN(1), Ham HR, Levy J, Piepsz A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Vrije Unviersiteit, Brussels, Belgium.

To investigate the attitude of Belgian pediatricians toward the management and
treatment of children with suspected acute pyelonephritis, a short letter was
sent to all Belgian pediatricians (1,200). It contained a brief description of a 
clinical case strongly suggestive of acute pyelonephritis followed by a series of
questions centered on complementary examinations to be performed, need of
hospitalization and treatment. A total of 583 responses were received (49%). In
the acute phase, 99% of pediatricians perform urine cultures, 87% blood
examinations, and 76% renal ultrasound. Dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) scintigraphy
is performed during the acute phase by 37% and during follow-up by 32% of all
pediatricians. A voiding cystogram is requested by 71%. Ambulatory treatment is
considered by 30% of responders. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (44%) and
trimethoprim/sulfonamide (22%) are the most frequently used oral antibiotics.
Private pediatricians perform fewer examinations and more frequently consider
ambulatory treatment of acute pyelonephritis, compared to pediatricians working
in hospitals. Among Belgian pediatricians, attitudes toward the diagnosis and
treatment of acute pyelonephritis are heterogeneous. This survey underlines the
need for properly documented prospective studies for the evaluation of different 
treatment modalities in childhood acute pyelonephritis.

Park, Cardiff CF14 4XN, UK.

Comment in
    Arch Dis Child. 2001 Oct;85(4):348.

AIM: To assess the outcome of imaging investigations carried out in children with
urinary tract infection (UTI), to compare the investigations with national
guidelines, and to assess the impact on management.
METHODS: Retrospective review of inpatients and outpatients, aged 0-12 years,
referred to the University Hospital of Wales Healthcare Trust between February
1997 and January 1998 with UTI. All children without bacterial evidence of UTI
and children previously investigated for antenatal urological anomalies, major
congenital anomalies, or UTI were excluded.
RESULTS: A total of 164 children (51 boys, 113 girls) were included. Thirteen of 
56 infants (23%) and 82/108 older children (76%) were diagnosed at home over one 
year. The prevalence of dilatation on ultrasound was 8%, renal scarring on
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was 11%, and vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was 
34% when investigations were carried out following guidelines published by the
Royal College of Physicians. In children aged 1-6 years, the prevalence of
scarring was 1/54 (2%) in those treated at home and 6/18 (33%) in inpatients.
CONCLUSION: The low yield of positive results and lack of evidence of impact on
management indicate that DMSA scanning, with all the implications of isotope
exposure, intravenous injection, staff time, psychological trauma, and expense,
could be omitted in children over 1 year with first simple UTI not sufficiently
ill to be admitted to hospital. The low rate of detection of UTI in primary care 
in infants may represent under diagnosis.

Surgical correction of vesicoureteral reflux: 5-year follow-up with 99Tcm-DMSA
scintigraphy.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los
Angeles, CA 90095, USA. cschiepers@mednet.ucla.edu

AIM: To evaluate kidney function before and after surgical correction of
vesicoureteral reflux. The long-term effect was measured with quantitative
nephro-scintigraphy using 99Tcm labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid (99Tcm-DMSA).
METHODS: Forty-five children with a history of urinary tract infections due to
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) were studied. VUR grade was determined with contrast 
voiding cystourethrography. Planar scintigraphy was performed with 99Tcm-DMSA and
uptake measured as a percentage of injected dose. Kidney function was evaluated
at baseline and 5 years after corrective surgery.
RESULTS: Three months after surgery, persistent mild reflux was found in eight of
76 treated renal units. Kidney uptake at 5-year follow-up was unchanged in the
majority of children, indicating preservation of renal function found at
baseline. The split renal function showed an excellent correlation (r = 0.99)
between baseline and follow-up studies (regression slope 1.01). Percentage uptake
had a regression slope of 0.89 significantly different from unity (P<0.05).
Empirical kidney-depth correction techniques were compared. The scintigraphic
pattern worsened in six kidneys, indicative of increased scarring in a minority
of children.
CONCLUSION: Planar nephro-scintigraphy with 99Tcm-DMSA was well tolerated in our 
paediatric population, and appeared appropriate to evaluate kidney function in
time. After surgical correction of VUR, the baseline function was maintained in
94% of kidneys.

Associations of tibia lead, DMSA-chelatable lead, and blood lead with measures of
peripheral nervous system function in former organolead manufacturing workers.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: The goals of the present study were to compare and contrast
associations of blood lead, DMSA-chelatable lead, current tibia lead, and
back-extrapolated "peak" tibia lead with four peripheral nervous system (PNS)
sensory and motor function measures in older males with past exposure to organic 
and inorganic lead.
METHODS: Data were collected from former organolead manufacturing workers with an
average of 16 years since last occupational lead exposure. Current tibia lead
levels were measured by (109)Cd x-ray fluorescence. Sensory pressure thresholds
(index and pinky fingers) and pinch and grip strength were measured with the
Pressure-Specified Sensory Device (PSSD).
RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, none of the four lead biomarkers was associated
with sensory pressure threshold of the index finger or pinch or grip strength. In
contrast, all four biomarkers were associated (P < or = 0.10) with pressure
threshold of the pinky finger. The final linear regression models accounted for a
small proportion of the variance in the sensory (1-3%) and motor measures
(10-21%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study found no strong association between lead biomarkers and
selected PNS sensory or motor function measures among former organolead
manufacturing workers with no recent occupational exposure to lead. Previously
reported CNS findings in this cohort suggest that the PNS may be less sensitive
to the chronic toxic effects of lead in this dose range among adults. It is also 
possible that the PNS has a greater capacity for repair than does the CNS, or
that the PNS measures were less sensitive for detection of lead-related health
outcomes than were the CNS measures.

BAL modulates glutamate transport in synaptosomes and synaptic vesicles from rat 
brain.

Porto Alegre, Brazil.

The therapeutic use of BAL (2,3-dimercaptopropanol) as treatment for poisoning
has been halted by data suggesting serious neurotoxicity. This article is a
report on the effects of BAL and other dithiols, DMSA
(meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) and DMPS (2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic
acid), on [3H]glutamate release and uptake by rat brain synaptosomes and
[3H]glutamate uptake by synaptic vesicles. BAL (100 microM) inhibited glutamate
uptake (30%) and stimulated its basal release (30%) in synaptosomes, without
affecting K+-stimulated release. BAL also inhibited glutamate uptake by synaptic 
vesicles (up to 60%). DMPS and DMSA (100 microM) had no significant effects on
these parameters. The data reported here provide some evidence of glutamate
involvement in BAL-induced neurotoxicity by demonstrating direct effects of BAL
on glutamatergic system modulation.

USA. bschwart@jhsph.edu

The authors performed a cross-sectional study to evaluate associations between
blood lead, tibia lead, and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)-chelatable lead and
measures of neurobehavioral and peripheral nervous system function among 803
lead-exposed workers and 135 unexposed controls in South Korea. The workers and
controls were enrolled in the study between October 1997 and August 1999. Central
nervous system function was assessed with a modified version of the World Health 
Organization Neurobehavioral Core Test Battery. Peripheral nervous system
function was assessed by measuring pinch and grip strength and peripheral
vibration thresholds. After adjustment for covariates, the signs of the beta
coefficients for blood lead were negative for 16 of the 19 tests and blood lead
was a significant predictor of worse performance on eight tests. On average, for 
the eight tests that were significantly associated with blood lead levels, an
increase in blood lead of 5 microg/dl was equivalent to an increase of 1.05 years
in age. In contrast, after adjustment for covariates, tibia lead level was not
associated with neurobehavioral test scores. Associations with DMSA-chelatable
lead were similar to those for blood lead. In these currently exposed workers,
blood lead was a better predictor of neurobehavioral performance than was tibia
or DMSA-chelatable lead, mainly in the domains of executive abilities, manual
dexterity, and peripheral motor strength.

Author information: 
(1)Pedijatrijska klinika, Klinicki centar Univerziteta u Sarajevu.

OBJECTIVES: To emphasise the importance of early diagnosis of Vesicoureteric
Reflux (VUR) in prevention of renal failure.
METHODS: General testing of children was followed by micturating
cystourethrography (MCGU) for those with the diagnosis of urinary-tract
infection. In cases where high level of VUR was determined, satic nuclear
medicine scanning was performed using an isotope-labeled substance (e.g. DMSA).
RESULTS: 31 nephrology department patients were followed: 29 girls, 2 boys ages
0-15. MCGU showed 33 kidneys with reflux. 13 of the patients had reflux in the
first or second degree. 7 patients showed reflux of the 2-3 degree while 13 had a
high degree of reflux. Among the children under 7 years of age, total of 16
kidneys, DMSA showed various degrees of damage to the paranhaim and the
development of scars.
CONCLUSION: After the VUR has been diagnosed, it is difficult to predict whether 
scarring will take place. The possibility of scarring is higher among younger
children when appropriate therapeutic modalities are not identified.

Histopathology of skin lesions in chronic arsenic toxicity--grading of changes
and study of proliferative markers.

(1)Department of Pathology, University College of Medicine and IPGMER, Calcutta.

Chronic arsenic toxicity (CAT) manifests predominantly as cutaneous lesions in
the form of melanosis, keratosis and neoplastic changes. We have studied skin
biopsies from 42 patients of CAT. Histological study of H/E stained sections
showed--hyperkeratosis in 13, parakeratosis in 13, acanthosis in 12,
papillomatosis in 24, elongation of reteridges in 21, increased basal
pigmentation in 27 and dysplastic changes in 8 cases. Squamous cell carcinoma was
present in 2, basisquamous in 1 and basal cell carcinoma in 1 case. Changes of
skin lesions after drug DMSA and DMPS therapy compared to placebo were studied.
The result was inconclusive. Proliferative activity of skin lesions in CAT were
studied by AgNOR stain to assess the biological behaviour of the lesions. AgNOR
score showed--normal control 1.08, benign changes (e.g. Hyperkeratosis,
parakeratosis, acanthosis, papillomatosis etc.) without dysplasia--1.35, mild to 
moderate dysplasia--1.735, severe dysplasia--3.0 and carcinoma--3.56. Thus, AgNOR
score gives some idea on the biological behaviour of CAT lesions. It is suggested
that AgNOR staining should be done regularly along with H&E staining for proper
assessment of the cases.

Nucleares, Salazar, Estado de México, Mexico.

The uptake of the rhenium-188 (188Re(V)-DMSA) complex of dimercaptosuccinic acid 
by cervical carcinoma cells in nude mice was evaluated. The pharmacokinetics and 
dosimetry calculations in normal rats were also evaluated. The images obtained in
mice did not show significant accumulation in metabolic organs and the
biodistribution studies showed that 3.52 +/- 0.76% of the injected activity per
gram (n = 4) was taken up by the tumor. This percentage produces a cumulated
activity of 35.63 +/- 8.40 MBq h and an equivalent dose per injected activity of 
260 +/- 8.91 mSv/MBq. Pharmacokinetics and dosimetry of the 1887e(V)-DMSA complex
indicate that this radiopharmaceutical could be evaluated in patients with soft
tissue tumors, since the risk of radiation damage to the kidney or red bone
marrow could not be an obstacle for its application in therapeutic nuclear
medicine.

Oncological scintigraphy is described in two dogs with malignant lymphoma and
malignant schwannoma, respectively. The distribution of the radiopharmaceuticals 
could be visualized for the purpose of detection of neoplasia and eventual
metastases, and to evaluate the effectivity of therapy. It is concluded that
99mTechnetium MIBI and 99mTc DMSA (V) scintigraphy is useful for the detection of
soft tissue malignancy in dogs.

Effect of thiamine on the cadmium-chelating capacity of thiol compounds.

Tandon SK(1), Prasad S.

Author information: 
(1)Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, Lucknow, India.

The influence of thiamine on the efficacy of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA), diethyldimercapto succinate (DEDMS), alpha mercapto-beta-(2-furyl)
acrylic acid (MFA) and alpha-mercapto-beta-(2-thienyl) acrylic acid (MTA) to
mobilize cadmium and reverse cadmium-induced biochemical alterations was
investigated in cadmium-exposed rats. The thiamine coadministration enhanced the 
efficacy of MFA and MTA in reducing hepatic and renal burden of cadmium and that 
of DMSA and DEDMS in mobilizing hepatic cadmium. It also improved the efficacy of
DMSA, DEDMS and MFA in reversing the cadmium-induced increase in urinary alkaline
phosphatase and aspartate and alanine amino transaminases. The combined treatment
with thiamine and DMSA or MFA restricted the urinary loss of zinc and that with
thiamine and DEDMS reduced the loss of fecal copper, a general effect of
chelation. In conclusion, the administration of thiamine during chelation therapy
in cadmium poisoning may be beneficial and more effective than thiol chelating
agents alone, which needs to be confirmed in humans.

Antidotes--inappropriate timely availability.

Higgins MA(1), Evans R.

Author information: 
(1)Emergency Unit, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK.

The aim of this study was to determine the availability of antidotes to poisons
in Wales and the South West of England. A stocklist of antidotes that are
available to accident and emergency departments was requested and was compared
with recommendations from the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS). 
Chief pharmacists were invited to complete a short questionnaire regarding
knowledge of existing guidelines. Thirty-four of 43 centres replied (response
rate 77%). No department held all 36 antidotes (mean 13, range 7-33). All
departments held antidotes that were frequently used. Ninety-one percent of
departments held one cyanide antidote. Eighty-eight percent held one heavy metal 
chelating agent. The remaining antidotes were variably stocked. New agents such
as 4-methylpyrazole, hydroxocobalamin and the heavy metal chelating agents DMSA
and DMPS were infrequently held. Twenty of 34 chief pharmacists were unfamiliar
with existing UK guidelines. A trend exists whereby larger departments stocked
more antidotes. Some antidotes to poisons are not available in a timely fashion
in Wales and the South West of England. There is a lack of awareness of existing 
guidelines. New recommendations relevant to clinical need and local practice
should ideally be developed.

THE CURRENT STATE: Infections of the urinary tract are a frequent paediatric
problem. Their treatment requires to assess the localisation of infection within 
the uropoetic tract. Especially the acute pyelonephritis (AP) can lead to
irreversible changes within the renal parenchyma and alteration of renal
functions. Some imaging examinations can help in the assessment of the diagnosis 
of AP and contribute to appropriate therapy.SUBJECTIVE: The analysis of results
gained from imaging examinations in children with AP was based on the comparison 
of used techniques and the assessment of their exploitation for the diagnosis of 
AP.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: 38 children (17 girls and 21 boys at average age of 11.6
years) with clinical criteria of AP were subdued to ultrasonographic examination 
with B record (US-B) and ultrasonographic examination with energetic Doppler
(US-D). Both methods were compared with the findings gained by use of renal
scintigraphy 99mTc DMSA.
RESULTS: The positive finding of AP was proved in 36 children (94.7%). The
results of US-B proved AP in 14 children (36.8%) of the whole group of patients, 
i.e. in 38.8% with positive DMSA finding. US-D changes indicated AP in 15
children (39.4%) of the whole group, i.e. in 41.6% with positive DMSA finding.
The sensitivity of both methods US-B and US-D appear to be low for the
verification of changes in renal parenchyma in AP.
CONCLUSION: Despite its advantages and availability, the gain from
ultrasonographic examination in children suffering from AP is small. Clinical and
laboratory criteria are fully sufficient for AP verification in common clinical
practice. DMSA scintigraphy is a method of choice in complicated cases of AP.

BACKGROUND: Acute pyelonephritis often leaves children with permanent renal
scarring.
AIMS: To compare the prevalence of scarring following initial treatment with
antibiotics administered intravenously for 10 or three days.
METHODS: In a prospective two centre trial, 220 patients aged 3 months to 16
years with positive urine culture and acute renal lesions on initial DMSA
scintigraphy, were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg
once daily) for 10 or three days, followed by oral cefixime (4 mg/kg twice daily)
to complete a 15 day course. After three months, scintigraphy was repeated in
order to diagnose renal scars.
RESULTS: Renal scarring developed in 33% of the 110 children in the 10 day
intravenous group and 36% of the 110 children in the three day group. Children
older than 1 year had more renal scarring than infants (42% (54/129) and 24%
(22/91), respectively). After adjustment for age, sex, duration of fever before
treatment, degree of inflammation, presence of vesicoureteric reflux, and the
patients' recruitment centres, there was no significant difference between the
two treatments on renal scarring. During follow up, 15 children had recurrence of
urinary infection with no significant difference between the two treatment
groups.
CONCLUSION: In children with acute pyelonephritis, initial intravenous treatment 
for 10 days, compared with three days, does not significantly reduce the
development of renal scarring.

The anaerobically induced promoter dmsA (PdmsA) was adapted to optimize in vivo
expression of foreign antigens in attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi
live vector vaccines CVD 908-htrA. PdmsA from Escherichia coli and two
derivatives, PdmsA2 and PdmsA3 were cloned into a plasmid driving the expression 
of a gene encoding tetanus toxin fragment C. Expression of fragment C varied from
a low level induced by pTETdmsA, to moderate and high levels induced,
respectively, by pTETdmsA2 and pTETdmsA3. Mice were immunized intranasally with
CVD 908-htrA harboring pTETdmsA2 or pTETdmsA3, and the serum antitoxin response
was compared to that elicited by CVD 908-htrA(pTETnir15) (Pnir15 is a benchmark
anaerobically activated promoter). S. Typhi carrying pTETdmsA2 elicited modest
tetanus antitoxin titers while S. Typhi harboring pTETdmsA3 generated elevated
titers (GMT=55384) that were higher than elicited by pTETnir15 (GMT=4354)
(P=0.007). Mice immunized with CVD 908-htrA carrying pTETdmsA3 and pTETnir15
survived tetanus toxin challenge. P(dmsA) derivatives are attractive promoters
for in vivo expression of foreign genes in attenuated live vector vaccines.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the interrelations among chelatable lead (by
dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA), tibial lead, and blood lead concentrations in 802
Korean workers with occupational exposure to lead and 135 employed controls with 
only environmental exposure to lead.
METHODS: This was a cross sectional study wherein tibial lead, DMSA chelatable
lead, and blood lead were measured. Linear regression was used to identify
predictors of the three lead biomarkers, evaluating the influence of age, job
duration, sex, education level, alcohol and tobacco use, creatinine clearance
rate, and body mass index.
RESULTS: DMSA chelatable lead concentrations ranged from 4.8 to 2102.9 microg and
were positively associated with age, current smoking, and creatinine clearance
rate. On average, women had 64 microg less DMSA chelatable lead than men. When
blood lead and its square were added to a model with age, sex, current smoking,
body mass index, and creatinine clearance rate, blood lead accounted for the
largest proportion of the variance and sex became of borderline significance.
Tibial lead concentrations ranged from -7 to 338 microg/g bone mineral and were
positively associated with age, job duration, and body mass index. Women had, on 
average, 9.7 microg/g less tibial lead than men. Blood lead concentrations ranged
from 4.3 to 85.7 microg/dl and were positively associated with age and tibial
lead, whereas current smokers had higher blood lead concentrations and women had 
lower blood lead concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that age and sex are both predictors of DMSA
chelatable lead, blood lead, and tibial lead concentrations and that tibial lead 
stores in older subjects are less bioavailable and may contribute less to blood
lead concentrations than tibial lead stores in younger subjects. Although blood
lead concentrations accounted for a large proportion of the variance in DMSA
chelatable lead concentrations, suggesting that measurement of both in
epidemiological studies may not be necessary, the efficacy of each measure in
predicting health outcomes in epidemiological studies awaits further
investigation.

Washington Univ School of Medicine, 111 Michigan Ave NW, Washington, DC 20010,
USA. mmajd@cnmc.org

PURPOSE: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT), spiral computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and
power Doppler ultrasonography (US) for the detection and localization of acute
pyelonephritis by using histopathologic findings as the standard of reference.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bilateral vesicoureteric reflux was surgically created in 
35 piglets (70 kidneys). One week later, a liquid bacterial culture of
Escherichia coli was injected into the bladder. Three days after induction of
urinary infection, imaging studies were performed, and the kidneys were removed
for histopathologic examination. SPECT images were obtained 2-3 hours after
injection of 99mTc-DMSA. Transverse and coronal MR images were obtained with
gadolinium-enhanced fast inversion recovery. Transverse CT images were obtained
before and after injection of contrast agent. Power Doppler US was performed in
longitudinal, transverse, and coronal planes. Each kidney was divided into three 
zones for correlation of findings.
RESULTS: Histopathologic examination revealed pyelonephritis in 102 zones in 38
kidneys. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting pyelonephritis in the kidneys 
were 92.1% and 93.8% for SPECT, 89.5% and 87.5% for MR imaging, 86.8% and 87.5%
for CT, and 74.3% and 56.7% for US. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting
pyelonephritis in the zones were 94.1% and 95.4% for SPECT, 91.2% and 92.6% for
MR imaging, 88.2% and 93.5% for CT, and 56.6% and 81.4% for US. The pairwise
comparison of these modalities showed no statistically significant difference
among them except for US.
CONCLUSION: 99mTc-DMSA SPECT, spiral CT, and MR imaging appear to be equally
sensitive and reliable for the detection of acute pyelonephritis; power Doppler
US is significantly less accurate.

Technetium-99m labeled cyclam N-2'-methoxyethyl-2-(3'-nitro-1'-triazole)
acetamide (cyclam AK 2123) has been synthesized, radiolabeled and characterized
as a hypoxic tumor imaging agent. Radiochemical purity was greater than 95%.
Marker biodistribution was measured in normal Wistar strain rats at different
time intervals after intra venous (i.v.) administration. In vivo distribution and
scintigraphic imaging studies were performed after i.v. injection into mammary
tumor-bearing rats using a gamma camera and associated computer. Intratumor
partial oxygen pressure (pO2) and oxygen saturation measurements were performed
to estimate the oxygenation status of the tumors. Tumor to muscle ratio (T/M) of 
99mTc-cyclam AK 2123 was 8.5 which was compared with other tumor seeking
radiopharmaceuticals, viz. 99mTc-(V) DMSA (3.07), 99mTc-citrate (5.29) and
201T1C1 (3.29). T/M ratios were also evaluated in comparison with radioiodinated 
iodoazomycin galactopyronoside (125I-IAZG). The ratio obtained was 18 for
99mTc-cyclam AK 2123 and 20 for 125I-IAZG, respectively. The increased
concentration of radioactivity in these tumors suggests that this agent could be 
labelling hypoxic cells and have utility as an imaging agent.

OBJECTIVE: Vincristine has been widely used in various chemotherapeutic protocols
in oncology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of vincristine 
on the biodistribution of 99mTc-DMSA, 99mTc-GHA, and 99mTc-DTPA in Balb/c female 
mice.
METHODS: Vincristine (0.03 mg, 0.3 mL) was injected into female isogenic Balb/c
mice (n = 15), in 3 doses over an interval of 96 h. The 99mTc-DMSA, 99mTc-GHA, or
99mTc-DTPA (7.4 MBq) was administered after the last dose of vincristine. After
0.5 h the animals were killed rapidly. The organs (pancreas, thyroid, brain,
thymus, ovary, uterus, spleen, kidney, heart, stomach, lung, liver, bone, and
lymph nodes) were isolated and the radioactivity in each organ was counted in a
NaI(Tl) well counter. The percentage of radioactivity (%) in each was calculated 
and compared with the control group. Statistical analysis was performed by
Wilcoxon test (P < 0.05).
RESULTS: The percentage of 99mTc-DMSA was increased in the lung, pancreas, heart,
thyroid, brain, bone, and lymph nodes (inguinal and mesenteric). The percentage
of 99mTc-GHA was decreased in the uterus, ovary, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes
(inguinal and mesenteric), kidney, and heart. The percentage of 99mTc-DTPAwas
increased in thymus, lymph nodes (inguinal and mesenteric), ovary, uterus,
spleen, kidney, heart, stomach, lung, liver, and bone.
CONCLUSION: The results could be explained by the metabolization, toxic effect,
therapeutic, or immunosupressive action of the studied chemotherapeutic drug.

Tc-99m MDP and Tc-99m (V) DMSA images are described from a 49-year-old woman with
chronic renal insufficiency complicated by osteomalacia. Clinical, biochemical,
and radiologic bone profiles were compatible with osteomalacia. Osteomalacia is a
condition associated with disorders in which mineralization of the organic matrix
is defective. All bone lesions visualized with Tc-99m MDP also showed increased
uptake of Tc-99m (V) DMSA. Tc-99m (V) DMSA accumulation has been reported in many
malignant and some benign conditions. Pseudofractures in osteomalacia could be
included in the spectrum of benign lesions that accumulate Tc-99m (V) DMSA.

Diuretic MAG3 scintigraphy (F0) in acute pyelonephritis: regional parenchymal
dysfunction and comparison with DMSA.

99mTc-DMSA late static planar imaging or SPECT is being used for the
investigation of focal acute pyelonephritis (APN), especially in children with
urinary tract infection (UTI). Diuretic 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3)
dynamic scintirenography has been applied in the evaluation of kidney function
and structure, frequently to exclude obstruction. However, in children and adults
with a clinical picture of APN, diuretic MAG3 scintigraphy with zero time
injection of furosemide (MAG3-F0) was observed to display focal parenchymal
abnormalities; regional dysfunction (focal parenchymal decrease in early uptake; 
slow filling in and prolonged late retention of activity); or, less frequently,
fixed defects. This observation was further studied both retrospectively and
prospectively, and its sensitivity and specificity for APN were compared with
those of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).METHODS: In the retrospective study, for 
36 children with UTI and regional parenchymal findings on MAG3-F(0), data were
reviewed, analyzed, and compared with the results of concurrent DMSA studies. In 
the prospective study, for 57 children with clinical and laboratory findings
suggestive of APN, the 2 radiopharmaceuticals were used for imaging sequentially 
and the results of the 2 studies were compared. The criteria for abnormal
findings compatible with the diagnosis of APN were, for MAG3-F(0), regional
parenchymal dysfunction and fixed focal defects and, for DMSA, focal defects
without parenchymal loss.
RESULTS: In all groups of patients, most abnormal MAG3-F(0) studies (80%) showed 
regional parenchymal dysfunction, but in some (20%) a fixed defect was found.
Compared with DMSA and when both regional dysfunction and focal defects were
considered, MAG3-F(0) was as sensitive as DMSA. Some patients had only MAG3-F(0) 
abnormalities, suggesting a slightly lower specificity for MAG3-F(0) compared
with DMSA (86%); this finding needs further study, because it also raises
questions about the sensitivity of DMSA, considering that only a small percentage
of patients with clinically suggestive findings had abnormal study findings. In
most patients with fixed defects on both DMSA and MAG3-F(0), follow-up studies
showed no resolution, suggesting that a fixed defect on MAG3-F(0) may indicate
either more severe APN or preexistent scars and that regional dysfunction may be 
a sign more specific for APN and prognostic of potential recovery. In addition, a
pattern more specific for a scar--a fixed defect with a dilated regional
calyx--was seen on follow-up MAG3-F(0).
CONCLUSION: A fast (25-min) planar dynamic MAG3-F(0) study was found to be as
sensitive at depicting focal parenchymal abnormalities in APN as was the 3- to
4-h DMSA routine procedure. The sensitivity and specificity of both studies need 
further evaluation.

Direct comparison of radiology and nuclear medicine cystograms in young infants
with vesico-ureteric reflux.

McLaren CJ(1), Simpson ET.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Imaging and Paediatric Surgery, The Canberra Hospital,
ACT, Australia. chris.mclaren@act.gov.au

OBJECTIVE: To determine the sensitivity of the direct radionuclide cystogram
(DRC) in detecting vesico-ureteric reflux compared with the micturating
cysto-urethrogram (MCU) in the same initial setting, in infants younger than one 
year.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The results from the dual cystograms of 62 refluxing
infants < 1 year old (mean 0.58) were compared. Results from same-day renal
scintigraphy with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in 60 of the 62 infants were
also compared with the reflux grades.
RESULTS: Reflux was detected in 105 units, 96 detected on the DRC and 47 on the
MCU, representing a sensitivity of 91% and 45%, respectively. The DRC missed half
of grade 1, 20% of grade 2 and 6% of grade 3 reflux. Reflux at low bladder
filling rates (DRC) represented 40% of all reflux units, and a half (52%) of
scarred renal units detected by DMSA scintigraphy.
CONCLUSIONS: In young infants the MCU may fail to detect significant reflux and
the DRC may fail to detect the lesser grades. The combination of both cystograms 
in the initial investigation of reflux provides more comprehensive information.

FNR-dependent activation of the class II dmsA and narG promoters of Escherichia
coli requires FNR-activating regions 1 and 3.

Lamberg KE(1), Kiley PJ.

Author information: 
(1)Departments of Bacteriology and Biomolecular Chemistry, University of
Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA.

In Escherichia coli, the anaerobic expression of genes encoding the nitrate
(narGHJI) and dimethyl sulphoxide (dmsABC) terminal reductases is stimulated by
the global anaerobic regulator FNR. The ability of FNR to activate transcription 
initiation has been proposed to be dependent on protein-protein interactions
between RNA polymerase and two activating regions (AR) of FNR, FNR-AR1 and
FNR-AR3. To further our understanding of the role of FNR-AR1 and FNR-AR3 in
transcription activation, we measured the effects of FNR-AR mutants on expression
of the narG and dmsA promoters, PnarG and PdmsA. All the FNR-AR1 (FNR-S73F,
FNR-T118A, FNR-S187P), FNR-AR3 (FNR-G85A) and FNR-AR1-AR3 (FNR-G85A-S187P)
mutants that were tested decreased expression from PnarG and PdmsA in vivo.
Transcription assays of PdmsA also showed that the FNR-AR mutant proteins
impaired transcription activation in vitro. Furthermore, DNase I footprinting
analysis confirmed that this transcription defect was not a result of altered
DNA-binding properties. The function of FNR-S187P and FNR-G85A was also measured 
in strains containing sigma70 mutants (sigma70-K593A, sigma70-R596A and
sigma70-K597A) known to be impaired in FNR-dependent transcription activation. Of
all of the combinations analysed, only FNR-G85 and sigma70-K597 showed a genetic 
interaction, supporting the notion that FNR-AR3 and sigma70 interact functionally
in the process of transcription activation. Lastly, the transcription activation 
defect of the FNR-AR1 and FNR-AR3 mutants was greatly reduced when expression of 
PnarG was assayed in the presence of nitrate. As these growth conditions promote 
maximal activity of PnarG as a result of the combined function of NarL, IHF and
FNR, these results suggest that the requirements for FNR-AR1 and FNR-AR3 are
altered in the presence of additional activators.

OBJECTIVE: Postnatal investigation of mild degrees of fetal hydronephrosis has
allowed subsequent detection of infants with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). This
study was designed to provide short to medium term information on such infants
who had primary VUR, the rates of renal damage and progression over time, the
risk factors for such damage and to compare the characteristics of those who had 
mild dilatation of the fetal renal pelvis (4-9 mm) with those who had
moderate-severe dilatation (> or = 10 mm).
METHODOLOGY: Since June 1989, infants whose antenatal sonography had identified a
fetal renal pelvis with an anteroposterior diameter of > 4 mm were investigated
postnatally with renal ultrasonography and micturating cystourethrogram (MCU),
and placed on antimicrobial prophylaxis. Those with VUR received
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Infants were followed until
discharge based on resolution of VUR, surgery, or low grade VUR. A 5.5 year
cohort between June 1989 and December 1994 formed the study population. A review 
of notes and clinical review (if still under follow up) was undertaken.
Vesicoureteric reflux on MCU was regraded according to the International
Classification, and reflux nephropathy on DMSA scans was regraded according to
criteria proposed by Goldraich. Regression analysis was used to assess risk
factors for renal damage.
RESULTS: There were 69 infants (37 girls, 32 boys) who were identified with
primary VUR, with 37/69 having bilateral reflux. Eight had a urinary tract
infection during the follow-up period. There was a broad distribution of grades
of reflux detected (Grades I-3, Grades II-23, Grades III-19, Grades IV - 17,
Grades V-7). 99m-Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans on 57/69 (83%) demonstrated
renal damage in eight infants (14%). This was predominantly global contraction of
function. No progression of renal damage was seen over 2-7 years. Regression
analysis showed a strong association between Grades IV, V reflux and the presence
of renal damage (P < 0.001). Review of the degrees of fetal renal pelvic
dilatation showed that 60/69 infants were detected because of mild (4-9 mm)
dilatation. The majority (43/60) had lower grades of reflux (Grades I, II, 3),
but there was no obvious cut-off between 4 and 9 mm that could predict high grade
VUR (Grades IV, V).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of 4 mm to define an abnormal fetal renal pelvis allows a
much larger group of infants with high grade primary VUR to be detected than if a
higher cut-off measurement is used. Although it also detects many more infants
with low grade primary VUR, there is no obvious cut-off point at which this
effect predominates. Progressive renal damage was not seen in follow up of up to 
7 years of age. Renal damage on DMSA scanning in this group is almost exclusively
a pattern of global contraction of function. The presence of high-grade VUR
appears to be the only important factor in predicting the presence of renal
damage.

[The preoperative function of the affected kidney and the outcome of
endopyelotomy for ureteropelvic junction obstruction].

[Article in Japanese]

Between July 1988 and February 1998, we treated 132 patients with 133 procedures 
of endopyeloureterotomy via the transpelvic extraureteral approach and followed
them up for more than one year. Of 9 unsuccessful cases, 4 were confirmed to have
the patency of the stenotic segment on retrograde pyeloureterograms. We compared 
these 4 cases with another 4 cases which were subsequently treated successfully
despite poor renal function. Pre- and post-operative changes in renal function in
8 cases with unilateral hydronephrosis due to ureteropelvic junction obstruction 
were studied based on 99mTc-DMSA renal uptake rate and creatinine clearance. In
successful cases, DMSA renal uptake rates compared with the healthy side were 9% 
to 59%. Unilateral creatinine clearance was 6 to 34 ml/min. All cases were
improved slightly in renal function. In unsuccessful cases, DMSA the renal uptake
rate was 2% to 89% and creatinine clearance 10 to 16 ml/min. No improvement in
renal function was noted. Patients with differential renal function of less than 
20 ml/min would thus appear to have little chance of postoperative improvement of
differential function.

Reliability of DMSA for the diagnosis of renal parenchymal abnormality in
children.

Grunewald S.

Author information:

The objective of this study was to evaluate the variability of technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy interpretation by four nuclear
medicine physicians for the diagnosis of renal parenchymal abnormality in
children, and to compare variability among three different DMSA methods in
clinical use: planar alone, single-photon emission tomography (SPET) alone, and
planar with SPET. One hundred consecutive DMSA studies were independently
interpreted 3 times by four participating nuclear medicine specialists from
different departments and in random order. All scans were classified by the
presence or absence of renal parenchymal abnormality using the modified
four-level grading system of Goldraich. Indices of agreement were the percentage 
of agreement and the kappa statistic. Disagreement was analysed using children,
kidneys and kidney zones (three zones per kidney). Using patients as the unit of 
analysis, agreement for planar and planar with SPET methods was 87%-88% (kappa
0.74) for the normal-abnormal scan classification. The corresponding agreement
value for the SPET alone method was 78% (kappa 0.56). Similarly, substantial
disagreement (disagreement > or = 2 categories) occurred in 2.5% and 1.3% of
comparisons between observers for planar alone and planar with SPET,
respectively, but in 5.2% of comparisons for SPET alone. These results did not
vary appreciably whether interpretation of patients, kidneys or kidney zones was 
compared. It is concluded that the four experienced nuclear medicine physicians
showed substantial agreement in the interpretation of planar alone and planar
with SPET DMSA scintigraphic images. Interpretation of SPET DMSA images, without 
planar images, was significantly more variable than interpretation using the two 
other methods, disagreement occurring in more than 20% of comparisons. SPET DMSA 
scintigraphy, when used without planar images, does not provide a firm basis for 
clinical decision making in the care of children who may have renal damage. There
is no apparent benefit of reduced variability from the extra provision of SPET
data to nuclear medicine physicians who already have planar images.

Thoracic ectopic kidney in a child: a case report.

Aydin HI(1), Sarici SU, Alpay F, Gökçay E.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Gülhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey.

Congenital thoracic ectopic kidney is a very rare developmental anomaly and the
rarest form of all ectopic kidneys. It is usually asymptomatic and discovered
incidentally on a routine chest radiography. We report a thoracic ectopic kidney 
in a 19-month-old boy, which initially presented as a well demarcated mass at the
base of the right lung on chest x-ray. Intravenous pyelography (IVP) and
thoraco-abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a normal functioning
transdiaphragmatic thoracic ectopic right kidney, but technetium-99m DTPA and
DMSA scintigraphy demonstrated pelvic stasis. We hereby discuss the features of
congenital thoracic ectopic kidney and review the literature. Although it is
extremely rare, thoracic ectopic kidney should be considered in differential
diagnosis of a mass with a well demarcated superior margin in the lower part of
the thorax, and renal scintigraphy must be performed even if CT and IVP results
are normal.

A higher efficiency of cadmium binding with racemic than with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (rac-DMSA; meso-DMSA) was found in an in vitro
speciation model by Fang et al. (1996). This finding has not yet been tested in
vivo. This paper presents results on mobilisation of cadmium by meso- and
rac-DMSA in rats. Cadmium chloride was administered as the radioactive isotope
109Cd intraperitoneally to all animals. One group was an untreated control and
two groups were treated with meso- and rac-DMSA, respectively. Treatment with
chelators was applied twice, immediately after 109Cd and 24 hr afterwards
intraperitoneally at the dose of 1 mmol/kg, each. Six days later radioactivity
was measured in the liver and kidneys. Whole-body counting was carried out on
days 1, 2, 3 and 6 of the experiment. At the end of the experiment, both
treatments caused a decrease in 109Cd whole-body retention with rac-DMSA being
more efficient (decrease from 83% in control to 74% and 64% in groups treated
with meso- and rac-DMSA, respectively). The same reduction of 109Cd was obtained 
by both chelators in the liver (from 57% to about 47%). In the kidney only
rac-DMSA produced significant reduction of 109Cd (from 5.3% to 3.5%). In
conclusion, these results show modest reduction of cadmium in the body by two
isoforms of DMSA with rac-DMSA being slightly more efficient than meso-DMSA.

Galactosylated liposomes as carriers for targeting meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid to cadmium storage sites in cadmium exposed mice.

Behari JR(1), Nihal (nee Misra) M.

Author information: 
(1)Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, Lucknow, India.

In this study an attempt has been made to examine the efficacy of
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) using galactosylated liposomes as
carriers for mobilization of cadmium from the body of mice preexposed to cadmium 
chloride (0.005 mmoles/kg intraperitoneally daily for 4 days). Cadmium-exposed
mice after a rest period of 8 weeks were administered DMSA intravenously, two
injections 15 micromoles/kg with an interval of 48 h, as free form of DMSA, or
DMSA encapsulated in liposomes composed of phosphatidyl choline, cholesterol and 
phosphatidyl ethanolamine (7:2:1; PC-lip-DMSA) or in liposomes to which
p-aminophenyl galactoside had been anchored (Gal-lip-DMSA). Excretion of cadmium 
through urine and feces was monitored for 5 days. Thereafter animals were
sacrificed, liver, kidneys, spleen and isolated hepatocytes were analysed for
cadmium, copper and zinc concentration. Efficacy for cadmium mobilization from
the body was found to be in the order Gal-lip-DMSA>PC-lip-DMSA>DMSA. These
results show that liposomes can be used as targeted carrier system for chelating 
agents safely and efficiently as compared to administration of free chelating
agent.

PURPOSE: To study the effects of chronic, low-pressure, sterile vesicoureteral
reflux (VUR) on renal growth and function in a porcine model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unilateral VUR was created in five pigs, with the
contralateral kidney serving as a control. Preoperatively, and 1 year later,
ultrasonography, technetium 99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy,
contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and contrast-enhanced
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed. Morphologic abnormalities and
relative uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA were recorded. The postcontrast enhancement
ratios for parenchymal regions of interest at CT and MR imaging were determined. 
Ruthenium 103-labeled microspheres were used to determine regional blood flow.
After the pigs were sacrificed, the kidneys were excised, weighed, and analyzed
pathologically.
RESULTS: Two of five refluxing kidneys had less than 45% function at
scintigraphy. One of these two kidneys was small at postmortem examination. There
were no other imaging or gross pathologic abnormalities. There was no significant
difference in regional blood flow between the refluxing and nonrefluxing kidneys.
In all of the operated on kidneys, histologic examination showed focal chronic
inflammation and fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: Low-pressure sterile reflux into previously normal kidneys led to
mild, focal, chronic interstitial inflammation and fibrosis after 1 year. Imaging
findings were normal apart from a subtle decrease in tubular function in two
refluxing kidneys.

and prolonged follow-up.

Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil. eduolive@medicina.ufmg.br

With the widespread use of obstetric echography the incidence of fetal
hydronephrosis has been reported more frequently. Consequently, many uropathies
have been detected in asymptomatic neonates. The authors report their experience 
with prenatally detected primary non-refluxing megaureter. Newborns with fetal
hydronephrosis were investigated by ultrasonography and micturating
cystourethrogram after the beginning of chemoprophylaxis. If primary megaureter
was identified, after 1 month the children underwent 99tm-DMSA, diuretic
99tm-DTPA, and intravenous urography. Eight infants with primary megaureter
(bilateral in 3 cases) were identified, for a total of 11 renal units for study. 
All children were submitted to non-operative management. We performed
ultrasonography and diuretic 99tm-DTPA during follow-up, which lasted on average 
75 months. The mean cross-sectional diameter of the dilated ureter was 13.6 mm
during neonatal period, and reached 8.4 mm at the end of follow-up. The renal
function and the diuretic renogram remained stable throughout follow-up. Two
neonates presented transitory hypertension. Our results support the notion that
conservative management is safe for primary megaureter detected in asymptomatic
neonates, with most cases showing spontaneous regression during a prolonged
follow-up.

Mobilization and detoxification of polonium-210 in rats by 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid and its derivatives.

Rencová J(1), Volf V, Jones MM, Singh PK.

Author information: 
(1)National Institute of Public Health, Centre of Industrial Hygiene and
Occupational Diseases, Praha, Czech Republic.

PURPOSE: To reduce retention and toxicity of the alpha particle emitter
polonium-210 in rats by newly developed chelating agents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Repeated subcutaneous chelation was conducted after
intravenous injection of 210Po nitrate. For reduction of 210Po retention the
treatment with vicinal dithiols meso-and rac-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 
mono-i-amylmeso-2,3-dimercapto succinate (Mi-ADMS) and
mono-N-(i-butyl)-meso-2,3-dimercapto succinamide (Mi-BDMA) were used. For the
reduction of toxic effects of 210Po, treatment effectiveness of Mi-BDMA was
compared with that of
N,N'-di(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-biscarbodithioate (HOEtTTC, reference
compound).
RESULTS: Treatment with meso-DMSA and rac-DMSA altered the main excretion route
of 210Po, reduced its contents in the liver but increased its deposition in the
kidneys. Treatment with Mi-ADMS or Mi-BDMA increased total excretion of 210Po,
mainly via the faeces. Only Mi-BDMA decreased 210Po levels in the kidneys. The
effectiveness of all chelators decreased with delay in the start of treatment. In
a survival study, the lives of rats treated early with Mi-BDMA or delayed with
HOEtTTC were prolonged three-fold when compared with rats receiving a lethal
amount of 210Po only.
CONCLUSIONS: Of the vicinal dithiols examined, Mi-BDMA was the best mobilizing
chelating agent for 210Po and it reduced 210Po toxicity when the treatment
started immediately. However, the detoxification efficacy of the immediate
treatment with HOEtTTC, observed in our previous study, was superior to that of
the present result with Mi-BDMA.

Evaluation in the baboon model of (99m)Tc-biguanide as a tracer for renal
imaging.

Neves M(1), Dormehl I, Kilian E, Louw W, Lalaoui K, Pedroso de Lima JJ.

Author information: 
(1)Instituto Tecnológico e Nuclear, Sacavém, Portugal. mneves@itn1.itn.pt

Studies in various animal species have recently shown that (99m)Tc-BIG has
practical and dosimetric benefits for renal imaging that could probably make it a
good alternative to (99m)Tc-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA). In this 
study, using the baboon experimental model, the biodistribution of (99m)Tc-BIG
and (99m)Tc-DMSA are compared. It is demonstrated that early good contrast
imaging and more favourable dosimetry is possible with (99m)Tc-BIG compared to
(99m)Tc-DMSA, confirming the quoted previous findings with small animals.
Time-activity curves for kidneys and other organs support these findings, and
MIRDOSE software provided the dosimetry.

Associations of blood lead, dimercaptosuccinic acid-chelatable lead, and tibia
lead with polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor and [delta]-aminolevulinic acid
dehydratase genes.

and Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. bschwart@jhsph.edu

A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the influence of polymorphisms 
in the [delta]-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) and vitamin D receptor
(VDR) genes on blood lead, tibia lead, and dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA)-chelatable lead levels in 798 lead workers and 135 controls without
occupational lead exposure in the Republic of Korea. Tibia lead was assessed with
a 30-min measurement by (109)Cd-induced K-shell X-ray fluorescence, and
DMSA-chelatable lead was estimated as 4-hr urinary lead excretion after oral
administration of 10 mg/kg DMSA. The primary goals of the analysis were to
examine blood lead, tibia lead, and DMSA-chelatable lead levels by ALAD and VDR
genotypes, controlling for covariates; and to evaluate whether ALAD and VDR
genotype modified relations among the different lead biomarkers. There was a wide
range of blood lead (4-86 microg/dL), tibia lead (-7-338 microg Pb/g bone
mineral), and DMSA-chelatable lead (4.8-2,103 microg) levels among lead workers. 
Among lead workers, 9.9% (n = 79) were heterozygous for the ALAD(2) allele and
there were no homozygotes. For VDR, 10.7% (n = 85) had the Bb genotype, and 0.5% 
(n = 4) had the BB genotype. Although the ALAD and VDR genes are located on
different chromosomes, lead workers homozygous for the ALAD(1) allele were much
less likely to have the VDR bb genotype (crude odds ratio = 0.29, 95% exact
confidence interval = 0.06-0.91). In adjusted analyses, subjects with the ALAD(2)
allele had higher blood lead levels (on average, 2.9 microg/dL, p = 0.07) but no 
difference in tibia lead levels compared with subjects without the allele. In
adjusted analyses, lead workers with the VDR B allele had significantly (p <
0.05) higher blood lead levels (on average, 4.2 microg/dL), chelatable lead
levels (on average, 37.3 microg), and tibia lead levels (on average, 6.4
microg/g) than did workers with the VDR bb genotype. The current data confirm
past observations that the ALAD gene modifies the toxicokinetics of lead and also
provides new evidence that the VDR gene does so as well.

    J Nucl Med 2001 Apr;42(4):542.

Renal length measurements are used in evaluating several abnormalities of the
pediatric genitourinary tract. This study assesses reproducibility of renal
length measurements obtained with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
SPECT.METHODS: The lengths of 98 kidneys of 51 children (age range, 1-16 y; mean 
age, 5.4 y) who underwent 99mTc-DMSA SPECT were measured independently by 2
observers. Renal length was calculated by converting pixels between points at the
superior and inferior renal margins on a summated coronal image to centimeters.
Lengths were measured for kidneys as they appeared in situ and after realignment 
along their long axes. SPECT reconstruction, choice of display parameters,
positioning of points used for measuring, and alignment were performed
independently by each observer. Interobserver variability, interobserver
correlation, and mean differences between observers' measurements (expressed as
measurement of observer 2 - measurement of observer 1) were calculated.
RESULTS: Correlation between the observers' measurements was highly significant
for both nonaligned and aligned studies (r = 0.95 and 0.97, respectively; both, P
< 0.0001). Interobserver variability expressed as 1 SD was 3.6 mm for nonaligned 
studies and 2.8 mm for aligned studies. The mean difference between the 2
observers' measurements for nonaligned studies was 2.0 +/- 4.8 mm (P < 0.0001)
with a range of -11 to 14 mm. For aligned studies the mean difference between the
2 observers' measurements was -0.1 +/- 4.0 mm (P = 0.88) with a range of -20 to
10 mm. Differences between observers were not dependent on absolute renal length 
(P = 0.68 for nonaligned studies; P = 0.40 for aligned studies).
CONCLUSION: The variability in renal length measurements determined by 99mTc-DMSA
SPECT is similar to that reported previously using sonography. Because the
interobserver differences in renal length are similar to annual renal growth
rates during childhood, caution should be applied when incorporating renal length
measurements determined by 99mTc-DMSA SPECT into management algorithms.
Additional studies are required to further establish interobserver variability,
to assess intraobserver variability, and to evaluate means of improving
standardization.

PURPOSE: Although vesicoureteral reflux associated with bacteriuria may cause
renal scarring, sterile reflux is thought not to cause renal injury. We
determined the incidence and associated characteristics of renal abnormalities
using 99mtechnetium(Tc) dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy in
infants with high grade vesicoureteral reflux but no history of urinary tract
infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the results of 99mTc-DMSA
renal scintigraphy and renal ultrasonography performed during the first 6 months 
of life in infants with vesicoureteral reflux detected during the postnatal
evaluation of prenatal hydronephrosis or sibling reflux screening. Those with a
history of urinary tract infection, or evidence of ureteropelvic junction or
bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from study.
RESULTS: Of the 28 male and 6 female infants who met study criteria
vesicoureteral reflux was bilateral in 25 and unilateral in 9. Reflux grade was
IV or V, II or III and I in 38, 18 and 3 of the 59 refluxing renal units,
respectively. 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy revealed parenchymal abnormalities in
24 refluxing renal units (41%) in 22 patients (65%), of whom 19 (86%) were male
and 15 (68%) had bilateral reflux. We noted differential uptake less than 40%
with and without cortical defects in 10 and 7 refluxing units, respectively, and 
cortical defects only in 7. Of the 24 refluxing units with abnormalities 21 were 
associated with grade IV or V and 3 with grade II or III reflux. Ultrasound
showed evidence of renal injury in only 7 of the 17 patients (41%) in whom
99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy was abnormal.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study the majority of infants with high grade reflux had
decreased differential function and/or cortical defects. Parenchymal defects
detected by 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy were often not identified by renal
ultrasound. Therefore, 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy is especially useful for
initially evaluating infants with high grade, sterile vesicoureteral reflux.

99mTc(V)DMSA quantitatively predicts 188Re(V)DMSA distribution in patients with
prostate cancer metastatic to bone.

Rhenium-188 dimercaptosuccinic acid complex [188Re(V)DMSA], a potential
therapeutic analogue of the tumour imaging agent 99mTc(V)DMSA, is selectively
taken up in bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer. It would be helpful
in planning palliative radionuclide therapy if 99mTc(V)DMSA could be used to
predict tumour and kidney retention of 188Re(V)DMSA. The aim of this study was to
determine the correlation between tumour-to-normal tissue ratios and
kidney-to-soft tissue ratios of 99mTc(V)DMSA and 188Re(V)DMSA. This would
determine whether a scan with 99mTc(V) DMSA could be used to identify patients
for whom 188Re(V)DMSA treatment would be contra-indicated, and enable prediction 
of relative kidney and tumour radiation absorbed dose in 188Re(V)DMSA treatment. 
Ten patients with prostate carcinoma were recruited following observation of
disseminated bone metastases on a recent 99mTc-hydroxydiphosphonate bone scan.
Whole-body planar scans were obtained at ca. 4 h and 24 h after hydration and
injection of 600 MBq 99mTc(V)DMSA, and a week later, at similar times after
hydration and injection of 370 MBq 188Re(V)DMSA. A triple-energy window (TEW)
scatter correction was applied to the 188Re scans. Counts per pixel were
determined in regions of interest drawn over metastatic sites, kidneys and normal
soft tissue. Tumour-to-soft tissue ratios were significantly lower (by a factor
of approximately 0.8 after the TEW was applied) on 188Re scans than on 99mTc
scans, but the two were highly linearly correlated both in all individual
patients and in tumours pooled from all patients together both at 4 h and at 24
h. Kidney-to-soft tissue ratios were similarly correlated and were lower for
188Re than for 99mTc by a similar factor. Both tumour- and kidney-to-soft tissue 
ratios increased between 4 and 24 h but the latter increased more. In conclusion,
only minor differences were seen between 99mTc and 188Re scans, and
kidney-to-background ratios on 188Re scans were not higher than on 99mTc scans.
These differences are insufficient to infer that they are due to a real
difference in biodistribution, and they may be due only to different physical
imaging characteristics. Thus 99mTc(V)DMSA scans are predictive of 188Re(V)DMSA
biodistribution and could be used to estimate tumour and renal dosimetry and
assess suitability of patients for 188Re(V)DMSA treatment.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the findings of 99mTc-DMSA
renal scintigraphy in children with their first acute febrile urinary tract
infection in relation with several clinical-biological parameters and other
imaging studies and a long-term follow up.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 103 children between 1 month and 10 years old with their
first acute febrile urinary tract infection were studied by means of clinical and
laboratory assessment, renal ultrasonography and 99mTc DMSA renal scintigraphy in
the acute illness period. Patients were divided into two groups, those under 2
years old (n = 63) and those over 2 years old (n = 40).
RESULTS: Cortical scintigraphy showed renal changes in 56 patients (54,5%).
Children over 2 years of age had a higher incidence of renal lesions than younger
children (39,7% vs. 77,5%). Ultrasonography measuring renal volume showed a
simple concordance with scintigraphy in 64% of the patients. Reflux was
demonstrated in 23 patients (22,3%) without differences between patients with
normal or abnormal cortical scintigraphy. After having studied the factors that
were associated independently to the pathological results in the scintigraphy
through a logistical multivariant regression, it was observed that the child's
age, the elevation of the PCR and the alterations of the renal volume were
significant according to statistics and also associated to a larger amount of
pathological DMSA scintigraphy.
CONCLUSIONS: DMSA scintigraphy associated with other diagnostic methods can
improve the sensitivity and specificity to establish renal damage stage. During
the follow-up the acute lesions disappeared or improved in all cases and the
chronic lesions have not been modificated.

Association of angiotensin I converting enzyme gene polymorphism with reflux
nephropathy in children.

Comment in
    Nephron. 2001 Oct;89(2):231-2.

Deletion polymorphism of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been
studied as a risk factor in various cardiovascular diseases and chronic
nephropathies. Perturbation of local and systemic renin-angiotensin systems is
one of the possible mechanisms of the progression of reflux nephropathy. In this 
study, the implication of ACE gene polymorphism in renal scarring and
deterioration of renal function was analyzed in 66 children with vesicoureteral
reflux. The genotype for the polymorphism was determined by PCR, and renal scar
was identified by (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scan. The allelic frequency of the deletion 
polymorphism showed no significant difference either between patients with normal
renal function and those with decreased renal function or between patients with
renal scar and those without. We conclude that deletion polymorphism of ACE gene,
as an independent variable, is not associated with reflux nephropathy in children
with vesicoureteral reflux.

Rhenium-188 dimercaptosuccinic acid complex [(188)Re(V)DMSA], a potential
therapeutic analogue of the tumour imaging agent (99m)Tc(V)DMSA, is selectively
taken up in bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer. It would be helpful
in planning palliative radionuclide therapy if (99m)Tc(V)DMSA could be used to
predict tumour and kidney retention of (188)Re(V)DMSA. The aim of this study was 
to determine the correlation between tumour-to-normal tissue ratios and
kidney-to-soft tissue ratios of (99m)Tc(V)DMSA and (188)Re(V)DMSA. This would
determine whether a scan with (99m)Tc(V)DMSA could be used to identify patients
for whom (188)Re(V)DMSA treatment would be contra-indicated, and enable

the (188)Re scans. Counts per pixel were determined in regions of interest drawn 
over metastatic sites, kidneys and normal soft tissue. Tumour-to-soft tissue
ratios were significantly lower (by a factor of approximately 0.8 after the TEW

CT and 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy in adult acute pyelonephritis: a comparative
study.

PURPOSE: The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the relative value of 
CT and (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN)
in adult patients suspected of having urinary tract infection.
METHOD: The study was conducted in 36 patients presenting with symptoms
suggestive of urinary tract infection. Plain B-mode sonography, CT with contrast 
medium, and (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy of the kidneys were performed in all
patients. Both CT and (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy were performed within 72 h after 
admission.
RESULTS: Twelve patients with clinical and biological signs of urinary tract
infection had no CT or (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy abnormalities. Among these
patients, lower urinary tract infection was found in 10 patients and 2 patients
had ureteral obstruction. In the 24 remaining patients, the diagnosis of APN was 
made. Among these patients, a correlation was found between CT and (99m)Tc-DMSA
scintigraphy in 11 cases. In two cases, both examinations were normal, and in
nine cases, both were abnormal. In 11 cases of the 13 remaining patients,
abnormal CT was found with normal (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy, whereas the 2 last
cases had normal CT and abnormal (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy results. In two cases,
bilateral lesions found on CT manifested as unilateral abnormalities on
(99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy images.
CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of APN in adult patients is based on clinical
presentation and biological findings. Few studies have compared (99m)Tc-DMSA
scintigraphy with CT in the detection of parenchymal involvement in APN. We
conclude that CT is more accurate than (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy in the detection
of APN lesions in adult patients.

A comparison of different lead biomarkers in their associations with lead-related
symptoms.

Lee BK(1), Ahn KD, Lee SS, Lee GS, Kim YB, Schwartz BS.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Industrial Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Chonan, Choongnam,
Republic of Korea.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) -chelatable lead, 
an estimate of current bioavailable lead stores, is a better predictor of
lead-related symptoms than are other commonly used lead biomarkers.
METHODS: A total of 95 male lead workers from three lead industries (one
secondary lead smelting facility, one polyvinyl chloridestabilizer manufacturing 
plant, and one lead-acid storage battery factory), and 13 workers without
occupational lead exposure recruited from an occupational health institute, were 
studied. Blood lead, blood zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP), 4 h DMSA-chelatable lead
(after oral administration of 10 mg/kg DMSA), urine lead, and urinary
delta-aminolevulinic acid levels were evaluated as predictors of 15 lead-related 
symptoms, assessed by self-administered questionnaire, with linear and logistic
regression controlling for covariates. Total symptoms and symptoms in three
categories (gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and general) were evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) 4 h DMSA-chelatable lead level was 288.7 (167.7) microg,
with a range from 32.4 to 789 microg in the 95 lead workers. The mean (SD) in the
non-exposed subjects was 23.7 (11.5) microg with a range from 10.5 to 43.5
microg. Blood lead, blood ZPP, and spot urine lead levels ranged from 21.4 to
78.4 microg/dl, 40 to 331 microg/l, and 7.5 to 153.0 micro/l, respectively, in
the lead workers, and from 4.0 to 7.2 micro/dl, 27 to 52 microg/l, and 2.9 to
15.5 microg/l in the non-exposed controls, respectively. The overall mean symptom
score (SD), derived as the sum of 0 or 1 point for absence or presence of 15
symptoms, of the lead workers was 3.7 (2.0), compared to 1.2 (1.5) for the
non-exposed workers. DMSA-chelatable lead was the best predictor of symptom
scores in both crude and adjusted analyses, compared with the other biomarkers.
Lead workers with DMSA-chelatable lead values greater than the median (260.5
microg) were 6.2 times more likely to have frequent tingling or numbness of the
arms or legs and 3.3 times more likely to have muscle pain than subjects with
lower chelatable lead values. Three symptoms (tingling or numbness of arm or leg,
muscle pain, and feeling irritation at the slightest disturbance) evidenced a
dose-dependent relationship with DMSA-chelatable lead levels.
CONCLUSIONS: DMSA-chelatable lead was found to be the best predictor of
lead-related symptoms, particularly of both total symptom scores and
neuromuscular symptoms, than were the other other lead biomarkers.

UTI: diagnosis and evaluation in symptomatic pediatric patients.

Comment in
    Clin Pediatr (Phila). 2001 May;40(5):302-3.

We retrospectively reviewed data on 260 hospitalized pediatric patients with
symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). To ascertain the colony-forming units 
(CFU)/mL compatible with the diagnosis of UTI, a culture from a catheterized
urine specimen containing >1,000 CFU/mL was considered diagnostic of UTI and
resulted in imaging by renal ultrasound, voiding cystourethrography, and renal
nuclear scan with Tc99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). A positive DMSA renal
scan is indicative of pyelonephritis. We used logistic regression analysis to
determine which patient characteristics were predictive of pyelonephritis. We
determined that, in hospitalized pediatric patients, the colony count of the
positive urine culture, the type of organism grown in culture, and the voiding
cystourethrography (VCUG) result (positive or negative for vesicoureteral reflux)
did not predict which patients had pyelonephritis. In females, advancing age of
the patient and positive renal ultrasound results were predictive of which
patients had pyelonephritis when we controlled for other factors. We feel this
emphasizes the importance of a thorough evaluation of hospitalized symptomatic
patients, including patients with colony counts of 1,000 to 50,000 CFU/mL, to
locate the level of infection and plan appropriate therapy.

In this study, the authors have reported 100 cases of primary vesico-ureteral
reflux (VUR) which occurred over a 7-year period. Patient age at presentation
ranged from 1 month to 13 years, with a mean age of 3 years and 5 months.
Overall, a higher rate of reflux was observed in the female population (63%)
which was particularly evident after the age of 3 years, but with a male
predominance during the first 12 months of life. In the majority of cases, the
diagnosis of VUR was made following diagnosis and investigation of urinary
infection (UI). A high level of UI was the most frequent sign of VUR (87% of
cases), while in 6% of cases this disorder was diagnosed during the investigation
of an uropathy which was found to be complex in all subjects. An analysis of 143 
ureteral reflux units (URU) showed that VUR was pathological only in 17% of
cases, and that the reflux grade was I, II, III and IV in 47.4, 28.14, 11.11 and 
2.34% of cases respectively. DMSA scintigraphy in 38 patients showed signs of
nephropathy in 24 cases, i.e., 14 scars and a decrease in kidney size in 9 cases,
and an absence of fixation for one grade IV reflux. Forty subjects with 56 reflux
units (34 grade I, II and 22 grade III, IV) were treated by antibiotic
prophylaxis, with a positive outcome in 85% of cases in children under 2 years of
age, compared to 40% for children aged over 2 years. Only 7 patients were treated
by teflon endoscopic injection, and in one case a further injection was required;
21 patients with 30 reflux units were treated by surgery at a mean age of 4
years. In conclusion, VUR is a fairly common disorder, which is frequently
detected via an IU; its potential gravity is associated with the risk of
subsequent nephropathy.

Comparison of two heavy metal chelators for treatment of lead toxicosis in
cockatiels.

Denver MC(1), Tell LA, Galey FD, Trupkiewicz JG, Kass PH.

Author information: 
(1)Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of California, Davis 95616,
USA.

OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy and safety of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) and Ca EDTA for treatment of experimentally induced lead toxicosis in
cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus).
ANIMALS: 137 (69 females, 68 males) healthy cockatiels between 6 months and 8
years old.
PROCEDURE: Lead toxicosis was induced by placing lead shot in the
gastrointestinal tract. Treatment with Ca EDTA (40 mg/kg of body weight, IM, q 12
h), DMSA (40 or 80 mg/kg, PO, q 12 h), and sodium sulfate salts (SSS; 0.5 mg/kg, 
PO, q 48 h) was initiated 4 days after induction of lead toxicosis. Blood lead
concentrations were determined, using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Number
of birds surviving and blood lead concentrations were compared among groups.
RESULTS: In Phase II of the study, administration of DMSA and Ca EDTA
significantly decreased blood lead concentrations when used alone or in
combination in birds with lead toxicosis. Addition of SSS did not result in
further decreases in lead concentrations. Eight of 12 (66.7%) birds without lead 
toxicosis given 80 mg of DMSA/kg did not survive to the end of the study. Lesions
related to treatment with chelating agents were not detected during necropsy.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: DMSA and Ca EDTA are effective chelating
agents in cockatiels. Because DMSA is administered orally, it may be easier than 
other chelating agents for bird owners to administer at home. However, the narrow
margin of safety of DMSA indicates that this agent should be used with caution.

Lightening the lead load in children.

Comment in
    Am Fam Physician. 2001 Aug 15;64(4):564, 567, 570.

More than 4 percent of preschool-aged children in the United States have blood
lead levels above 10 microg per dL (0.50 pmol per L), and these levels have been 
associated with a decline in IQ. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
advocates the use of a screening questionnaire to identify lead exposure or
toxicity in all children. Primary prevention through the removal of lead from
gasoline and paint has led to a reduction of blood lead levels in children.
Secondary prevention through paint hazard remediation is effective in homes that 
have a high lead burden. Children with lead levels of 45 to 69 microg per dL
(2.15 to 3.35 pmol per L) should receive chelation therapy using succimer (DMSA) 
or edetate calcium disodium (CaNa2EDTA). Use of both CaNa2EDTA and dimercaprol
(BAL in oil) is indicated in children with blood lead levels higher than 70
microg per dL (3.40 micromol per L). Current treatment recommendations are based 
on the reduction of blood lead levels, which may not represent a significant
overall reduction of the lead burden. Clinical trials of existing agents are
needed to determine patient-oriented outcomes, such as the effect on IQ.

Intraoperative use of gamma-detecting probes to localize neuroendocrine tumors.

Adams S(1), Baum RP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Medical
Center, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.

Neuroendocrine tumors are characterized by the expression of different peptides
and biogenic amines. These rare tumors tend to grow slowly and are notoriously
difficult to localize, at least in the early stages. Surgical removal is the only
definitive therapeutic option for neuroendocrine tumors and relief from
hyperfunctional status. The effectiveness of surgical treatment is invariably
dependent upon the complete surgical excision of all tumor tissue, because
microscopic and occult disease not readily seen by the surgeon may remain in
situ, leading to shortened survival. Therefore, pre- and intraoperative
localization of the primary as well as of metastatic tumors is of utmost
importance. Radioguided surgery (RGS) is an intraoperative technique that enables
the surgeon to localize radiolabelled tissue based on the characteristics of the 
various tissues. Concerning gastroenteropancreatic tumors (GEP), intraoperative
gamma probe examination is able to reveal small tumor sites accumulating
(111In-DTPA-D-Phe1)-pentetreotide more efficiently (> 90%) than somatostatin
receptor scintigraphy (68%-77%), because lesions with a size smaller than 5 mm in
greatest dimension could be identified. Furthermore, RGS identified 57% more
lesions when compared to the "palpating finger" of the surgeon. In medullary
thyroid cancer (MTC), surgical removal of the tumor is the first and most
efficient treatment of the disease. Persistent or increasing serum calcitonin and
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels imply tumor recurrence after thyroid
ablation. For imaging recurrent MTC many radiopharmaceuticals have been used to
visualize tumor sites, but none of them has shown excellent sensitivity.
Preoperative somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and intraoperative RGS in
patients with recurrent MTC demonstrate only part of the tumor sites and cannot
visualize small tumor sites (less than 10 mm). In comparison, RGS using
99mTc(V)-DMSA detects metastases with a size of 5 mm in diameter, whereas the
"palpating finger" of the surgeon localized metastases with a size of more than 1
cm in diameter. In patients with recurrent MTC, intraoperative gamma probe
examination is able to localize over 30% more tumor lesions when compared with
conventional preoperative imaging modalities and surgical findings. MIBG
scintigraphy is the most sensitive technique for the detection and staging of
neuroblastoma (sensitivity 92%; specificity nearly 100%). Intraoperative RGS with
iodine labelled MIBG has been developed to improve the definition of tumor limits
or to localize small, nonpalpable tumors. Comparison of 123I- and 125I-labelled
MIBG revealed a sensitivity of 91% and 92%, respectively; the specificity of 125I
(85%) was significantly higher than that of 123I (55%). In addition to
scintigraphy of the adrenal glands by precusors of adrenal hormones, imaging with
a radiolabelled somatostatin analogue is possible; however,
(111In-DTPA-D-Phe1)-pentetreotide is not specific for any adrenal disease or
function and the relatively high radioligand accumulation in the kidneys limited 
the use for detection of tumors in the area of the adrenal glands.

Safety and efficacy of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in children with
elevated blood lead concentrations.

Chisolm JJ Jr(1).

Author information: 
(1)Lead Poisoning Program, The Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore, Maryland
21205, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid in the treatment of children with lead toxicity.
DESIGN: This was an open-label study in 59 children 12-65-months old, with
pretreatment whole-blood lead levels of 25-66 microg/dL, who received 116, 26-28 
day courses of oral dimer-captosuccinic acid, while residing either in the
Pediatric Clinical Research Unit of the Johns Hopkins Hospital or in lead-safe
housing during the outpatient portion of the study.
RESULTS: All, who completed the study, showed sharp decreases in blood lead
concentration during therapy, but 2-3 weeks following completion of drug therapy,
blood lead concentration rebounded to an average of 58% (23 microg Pb/dL of whole
blood) of their average pretreatment blood lead concentration (40 microg Pb/dL of
whole blood). There were no adverse reactions attributable to dimercaptosuccinic 
acid; however, 2 of the 59 patients were reexposed to defective lead paint and
experienced sharp increases in blood lead concentration while on therapy. In one 
instance, the child's blood lead concentration increased from 20 to 90 microg
Pb/dL whole blood in 1 week. Other unexpected events were discussed in the text.
CONCLUSIONS: Dimercaptosuccinic acid is apparently safe and does mobilize lead
into the urine, but not the essential metals, zinc and copper. Reexposure is
always a danger; therefore, all children, while on therapy, should be monitored
for their blood lead concentration at weekly intervals during and immediately
after therapy. No conclusions can be drawn from this study regarding long-term
beneficial effects, if any, of this drug on late neurocognitive outcome.

The extent to which succimer (2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA) chelation
reduces target organ lead (Pb) levels, including the skeleton, relative to the
cessation of Pb exposure is a primary consideration in evaluating its efficacy
for reducing toxicity in children. Here, we utilized a rhesus monkey model of
childhood Pb exposure and a sensitive stable (204)Pb isotope tracer methodology
to determine the efficacy of succimer for reducing Pb in blood, liver, and
skeletal tissues from chronic (>/=1 year) versus short-term (3-4 days) Pb
exposures. Specific attention was paid to the efficacy of succimer treatment
compared to the cessation of Pb exposure. Infant rhesus monkeys (n = 48) were
exposed to Pb daily for 1 year or >1 year postpartum to reach and maintain a
target blood Pb level of 35-40 microg/dL. Two successive 19-day succimer
treatment regimens were administered at 53 and 65 weeks of age (30 mg/kg/day x 5 
days followed by 20 mg/kg/day x 14 days). Blood was collected over the course of 
treatment, and liver and bone biopsy samples were collected on days 0, 5, and 20,
relative to the start of treatment (day 0). Complete 24-h urine collections were 
conducted over the course of treatment. Results of the first chelation indicate
that a single regimen of succimer treatment led to significant reductions in
blood and liver Pb levels, relative to the placebo group. However, the cessation 
of Pb exposure alone (i.e., placebo) also led to significant reductions in blood 
and liver compared to pretreatment levels. Neither succimer nor the cessation of 
Pb exposure had a significant impact on bone lead levels. Blood Pb levels in the 
succimer-treated group rebounded within 5 days after treatment ended, becoming
comparable with levels in the placebo group from that point on. Results from the 
second chelation indicate that succimer treatment is essentially equally
efficacious in reducing blood Pb at moderate (20 microg/dL) levels where
exposures ended >3 months previously and more elevated (40-50 microg/dL) levels
where exposures ended just prior to treatment, relative to the placebo treatment.
Finally, similar overall outcomes were observed for tissue Pb from recent
exposures (i.e., (204)Pb tracer levels), indicating little or no apparent
difference in the chelation of Pb from recent (3-4 days) versus long-term
exposures. These data demonstrate that succimer does not reduce skeletal Pb
levels, and they show that the efficacy of succimer for reducing blood Pb levels 
does not persist beyond the completion of treatment due to posttreatment rebounds
in blood Pb from endogenous sources. They also demonstrate the relative benefit
of eliminating Pb exposures, which serves to underscore the importance of primary
prevention of Pb exposure. The extent to which these data reflect the efficacy of
succimer for reducing neurocognitive impairment is not yet known, although those 
data are forthcoming.

Can dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy be used to assess global renal
function?

Use of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been proposed for the assessment of
both relative and absolute renal function. Our aim was to test whether the renal 
absolute DMSA uptake (ADU) can reflect the absolute renal function from a
theoretical point of view. A simple model was used to compute the ADU in the case
of injury to one kidney. It was found that the assumption that ADU correctly
reflects the absolute renal function may lead to a more than 50% overestimation
of the function of both the normal and the impaired kidney. The later the
measurement is made and the more impaired is the kidney, the more important is
the error. Although DMSA can reliably quantify the relative renal function, it
should not be used to assess absolute renal function lest major overestimation
should occur.

[Renoscintigraphy applied with etylenedicysteine labeled with technetium 99m and

Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) can lead to renal parenchymal damage. Renal scarring 
is an important cause of chronic renal failure and hypertension in children. The 
significance of possible effects determines the necessity of early diagnosis of
urinary tract pathology. The aim of the paper was to evaluate the morphology and 
function of kidneys with VUR using selected radioisotope techniques, and to
compare the sensitivity of planar technique and single-photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT) technique in detection of renal scarring. In 45 children with 
VUR the following test were performed: ultrasonography, renoscintigraphy with
technetium-99m-ethylenedicysteine (EC-Tc-99m) and
technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA-Tc-99m) scintigraphy with planar and
SPECT mode. Stage of VUR correlates with stage of cortical lesions estimated as a
value of effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) in kidney, as well as scarring
intensity in static scintigraphy. The use of SPECT increases sensitivity of
examination for detection small, single scars. It seems that SPECT should be used
more frequently in children in the group of scarring risk. That would allow for
earlier diagnosis of renal scarring, enabling efficient treatment. Due to the
correlation between ERPF and parameters obtained in DMSA scintigraphy,
renoscintigraphy with EC-Tc-99m may be applied to monitor the progress of renal
scarring.

99Tcm-DMSA planar images of 49 randomly selected patients (10 adults, 39
children) were sent to 15 physicians at various centres in Belgium. They were
asked to calculate, using their own routine program, the relative uptake
(expressed as a percentage) of each kidney. The data were sent on disks formatted
so that they could be read by all participants, using their own computer systems.
For each scan, the inter-observer variability was expressed using the maximum
difference and the standard deviation of left renal uptake. Left renal uptake
measured by the 15 observers in the 49 patients was 29.0-72.0% (mean +/- s = 49.8
+/- 6.4%). The maximum differences in left renal uptake ranged between 1.7% and
12.0% (4.5 +/- 2.6%); however, the maximum difference did not exceed 8% in about 
90% of the patients. The standard deviations of the individual left renal uptake 
were between 0.6 and 3.9 (1.3 +/- 0.8). The standard deviations were
significantly higher in adults (mean standard deviation = 2.05) than in children 
(mean standard deviation = 1.12) (P < 0.001); this was probably related to the
high background observed in three adults with severe renal impairment. Indeed
there was a significant correlation (P < 0.001) between the standard deviation
and both the signal-to-noise ratio and the degree of asymmetry between the right 
and left kidneys. The differences between right and left kidney uptake were
systematically lower for some observers, suggesting an influence of the
calculation programs.

A role for oxidative stress in suppressing serum immunoglobulin levels in
lead-exposed Fisher 344 rats.

Evidence implicating oxidative stress in toxicity during lead intoxication in
vivo has opened new avenues for investigation of the mechanisms of lead-induced
immunosuppression. The current study explores the possibility that lead-induced
oxidative stress contributes to the immunosuppression observed during lead
poisoning. Fisher 344 rats were exposed to 2,000 ppm lead acetate in their
drinking water for 5 weeks. One week following removal of lead from the drinking 
water, significant reductions in serum levels of IgA, IgM, and IgG were detected.
Significant increases in oxidative damage, based on malondialdehyde (MDA)
content, were observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMCs) collected
during the same experiments. In addition, MDA content increased in livers from
lead-exposed rats. Following 5 weeks of lead exposure, administration of either
5.5 mmol/kg N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or 1 mmol/kg meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA) in the drinking water for 1 week significantly reversed the inhibitory
effects of lead on serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels. Also, all parameters
indicative of oxidative stress returned to control levels. These results suggest 
that oxidative stress contributes to suppressed serum Ig levels during lead
intoxication in vivo, and that intervention with either a thiol antioxidant (NAC)
or a metal chelator (DMSA) will alleviate this lead-induced suppression by
correcting the prooxidant/antioxidant imbalance caused by lead exposure.

Environmental medicine, part three: long-term effects of chronic low-dose mercury
exposure.

Mercury is ubiquitous in the environment, and in our mouths in the form of
"silver" amalgams. Once introduced to the body through food or vapor, mercury is 
rapidly absorbed and accumulates in several tissues, leading to increased
oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death. Mercury primarily
affects neurological tissue, resulting in numerous neurological symptoms, and
also affects the kidneys and the immune system. It causes increased production of
free radicals and decreases the availability of antioxidants. It also has
devastating effects on the glutathione content of the body, giving rise to the
possibility of increased retention of other environmental toxins. Fortunately,
effective tests are available to help distinguish those individuals who are
excessively burdened with mercury, and to monitor them during treatment.
Therapies for assisting the reduction of a mercury load include the use of
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 2,3-dimercato-1-propanesulfonic acid
(DMPS). Additional supplementation to assist in the removal of mercury and to
reduce its adverse effects is discussed.

A cluster of pediatric metallic mercury exposure cases treated with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)

Nine children and their mother were exposed to vapors of metallic mercury. The
source of the exposure appears to have been a 6-oz vial of mercury taken from a
neighbor's home. The neighbor reportedly operated a business preparing
mercury-filled amulets for practitioners of the Afro-Caribbean religion Santeria.
At diagnosis, urinary mercury levels in the children ranged from 61 to 1,213
microg/g creatinine, with a geometric mean of 214.3 microg/m creatinine. All of
the children were asymptomatic. To prevent development of neurotoxicity, we
treated the children with oral meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). During
chelation, the geometric mean urine level rose initially by 268% to 573.2 microg 
mercury/g creatinine (p<0.0005). At the 6-week follow-up examination after
treatment, the geometric mean urine mercury level had fallen to 102.1 microg/g
creatinine, which was 17.8% of the geometric mean level observed during treatment
(p<0.0005) and 47.6% of the original baseline level (p<0.001). Thus, oral
chelation with DMSA produced a significant mercury diuresis in these children. We
observed no adverse side effects of treatment. DMSA appears to be an effective
and safe chelating agent for treatment of pediatric overexposure to metallic
mercury.

To determine the function of the remaining contralateral kidney after the removal
of a functioning kidney, 30 consecutive patients (18 men, 12 women; average age, 
67 y; age range, 34-87 y) who were undergoing unilateral radical nephrectomy were
evaluated by sequential quantitative 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) SPECT
(QDMSA) studies.METHODS: The 30 patients were undergoing radical nephrectomy for 
renal tumors. The first study was done before surgery. Follow-up studies were
performed 2-23 mo after surgery. Clinical evaluations and determinations of serum
creatinine level were performed at the same time as the QDMSA studies.
RESULTS: The relative contribution of the resected kidneys to the global renal
function before surgery was 43.2% +/- 7.3%. After surgery the uptake of the
remaining kidney increased from 13.4% +/- 4.0% to 18.3% +/- 5.8% (t = 5.7; P =
0.0000). The relative function of the remaining kidney increased from 56.8% +/-
7.1% to 79.1% +/- 23.6% (t = 4.9; P < 0.0001) of the global renal function before
nephrectomy. Increases in the renal volume (from 211 +/- 62 cm3 to 229 +/- 68
cm3; t = 4.5; P = 0.0001) and in the percentage injected dose per cubic
centimeter (%ID/cm3) of the remaining kidney (from 0.066 +/- 0.02 % ID/cm3 to
0.085 +/- 0.03 %ID/cm3; t = 4.6; P = 0.0001) were associated with this change.
Nine patients had 2 follow-up studies performed 3-4 mo after surgery and 12-14 mo
after surgery. The volume of the remaining kidney (209.22 +/- 46.20 cm3 versus
217.88 +/- 58.85 cm3; t = 0.962; P = 0.364), the %ID/cm3 (0.09 +/- 0.016 %ID/cm3 
versus 0.093 +/- 0.025 %ID/cm3; t = 0.362; P = 0.726), and the percentage uptake 
(19.26% +/- 4.45% versus 20.11% +/- 7.01%) did not change significantly between
these 2 QDMSA studies.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that adaptive changes causing
hyperfunction of the remaining kidney may occur after nephrectomy of a
functioning kidney in adults. These changes occur soon after surgery, persist for
at least 1 y, and are evident on QDMSA studies.

How accurate is dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy for the diagnosis of acute
pyelonephritis? A meta-analysis of experimental studies.

Craig JC(1), Wheeler DM, Irwig L, Howman-Giles RB.

Author information: 
(1)Center for Kidney Research and Department of Nuclear Medicine, The New
Children's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and to compare 
the test performance of the standard technique, planar DMSA, with the newly
introduced technique, SPECT DMSA.METHODS: All published animal studies in which
DMSA scintigraphy was compared with histopathology, the reference standard for
acute pyelonephritis, were identified using a comprehensive search strategy with 
the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Test performances of all DMSA methods and SPECT
versus planar DMSA were analyzed using summary receiver operating characteristic 
(sROC) curves.
RESULTS: Seven studies were identified, including 2 of SPECT DMSA. Problems in
study design or reporting were common, with numerical errors in 4 studies.
Overall, at a sensitivity of 86%, specificity was estimated to be 91%. Detection 
of acute pyelonephritis was at a lower threshold for SPECT than for planar DMSA
(sensitivity/specificity values of 97%0/66% compared with 82%/ 97%), and the
overall test performance of SPECT was not demonstrably better than that of planar
DMSA. When applied to a group of children with a prevalence of renal damage of
40%, this means that 98% of children with abnormal planar DMSA scans will have
renal damage, whereas only 65% of those with abnormal SPECT scans will have renal
damage. Planar and SPECT DMSA will miss 11% and 3% of children with renal damage,
respectively. Out of 100 children in the hypothetical group with 40% experiencing
renal damage, SPECT will identify 6 extra true cases of renal damage at the
expense of 19 extra false positives, when compared with planar DMSA.
CONCLUSION: Published studies of DMSA test performance are few in number and have
significant methodologic problems that should be avoided in future studies. DMSA,
particularly the planar technique, performs well for the diagnosis of acute
pyelonephritis. Using test performance criteria, SPECT DMSA alone has not been
shown to be preferable to the established planar method and will result in a
small number of true-positives at the expense of a larger number of
false-positives.

A review on urinary proteins in outflow disease of the upper urinary tract.

karel.everaert@rug.ac.be

INTRODUCTION: [corrected] No review articles on outflow disease of the upper
urinary tract discuss urinary protein excretion.
DISCUSSION: Following acute partial and/or complete ureteral obstruction (UO) or 
chronic partial UO, alpha-1-microglobulin excretion is significantly higher than 
in the reference population or patients with proven renal dilatation without
obstruction, but is not found to be diagnostic for these conditions as such.
Chronic partial UO is followed first by a destructive and then by a steady-state 
phase in renal damage. The observed increase in tubular proteinuria during the
destructive phase correlates with the decrease in absolute dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) uptake. If the destructive phase is not followed by a stable phase, a
mixed tubular and glomerular proteinuria is seen. Urinary alpha-1-microglobulin
excretion is found to be diagnostically useful in vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR)
patients, increases with higher intravesical-intrapyelic pressure, correlates
with the decrease in absolute DMSA uptake or with urinary epidermal growth factor
excretion (both markers of the number of functioning nephrons) and predicts the
outcome after treatment.
CONCLUSION: alpha-1-Microglobulin is useful in the detection of renal tubular
damage in patients with outflow disease of the upper tract, is diagnostic for VUR
but is not so for ureteral obstruction.

The therapeutic efficacy of a combination of meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) and calcium disodium EDTA in protecting testicular disorders in chronic
lead intoxication was investigated. The results indicate that two five-days
courses of the combined therapy produced a more effective recovery in the lead
induced biochemical and histopathological disorders compared to conventional
single 5 days therapy. No adverse effect of the chelators, when administered
individually or in combination, was noticed in the testes of control (without
lead exposure) animals.

Radiation dose to patients from radiopharmaceuticals (addendum 2 to ICRP
publication 53).

[No authors listed]

A joint Task Group of ICRP Committees 2 (Doses from Radiation Exposures) and 3
(Protection in Medicine; lead Committee for this report) has prepared a
compilation of data on radiation dose to patients from radiopharmaceuticals. The 
report provides biokinetic models, absorbed doses, and effective doses, using
ICRP Publication 60 dosimetry, for 10 new radiopharmaceuticals:
[Methyl-11C]thymidine; [2-11C]thymidine; 14C urea (incl. carbon dioxide and
bicarbonate); 15O water; 99mTc HIG, Pertechnegas, Technegas, and tetrofosmin; and
111In HIG and octreotide. It also provides recalculated dose data for the 19 most
frequently used radiopharmaceuticals from ICRP Publication 53, using ICRP
Publication 60 dosimetry, viz. 18F FDG; 51Cr EDTA; 67Ga citrate; 75Se SeHCAT;
99mTc DMSA, DTPA, RBC, IDA, large colloids, WBC, MAA, non-absorbable markers,
pertechnetate, and phosphates and phosphonates; 123I Hippuran and MIBG; 131I
Hippuran and NP59; and 201Tl thallous ion. Printing errors detected in ICRP
Publication 53 are also listed. Furthermore, the report reproduces with minor
corrections and updates, and therefore supersedes, the information on 6
radiopharmaceuticals given in Addendum 1 to ICRP Publication 53: 3H neutral fat
and fatty acids; 14C neutral fat and fatty acids; 68Ga EDTA; and 99mTc HM-PAO,
MAG3, and MIBI. There is an integrated index to all radiopharmaceuticals treated 
in ICRP publications so far, including a listing of effective doses per unit
activity administered to adults. This issue of the Annals of the ICRP also
includes an Addendum to ICRP Publication 72 concerning age-dependent doses to
members of the public from intakes of radionuclides.

The authors present a case of in situ ductal carcinoma of the breast (DCIS) with 
no associated mass in a 46-year-old woman examined with Tc-99m MIBI and Tc-99m(V)
DMSA scans, which were acquired in separate sessions 10 minutes and 60 minutes
after injection. Histologic analysis revealed a small (<1 cm) infiltrating ductal
carcinoma located within the DCIS. Mammography showed a cluster of
microcalcifications on a very dense parenchymal background. Tc-99m(V) DMSA was
characterized as positive for DCIS, especially in the delayed image. Tc-99m MIBI 
failed to identify the lesions previously noted. In conclusion, Tc-99m(V) DMSA
scintimammography seems to have an advantage and could improve the detection of
nonpalpable in situ breast carcinomas.

Imaging after urinary tract infection in male neonates.

Goldman M(1), Lahat E, Strauss S, Reisler G, Livne A, Gordin L, Aladjem M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, Zerifin, Israel.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of urinary tract anomalies in male neonates <8
weeks old who presented with urinary tract infection (UTI), and to evaluate a
suitable imaging approach after the initial infection.
DESIGN: During a period of 4.5 years, from July 1994 through December 1998, 45
male neonates <8 weeks old (range: 5-56 days; mean: 23.77 days) with UTI were
hospitalized. All patients had an ultrasound (US) and a voiding cystourethrogram 
(VCUG), except 1 neonate in whom VCUG was unsuccessful because of technical
problems. A dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was recommended to all patients
but was performed only in 30 of 45, most of them with an abnormal VCUG. The renal
scan was performed at least 4 months after the UTI.
RESULTS: Urinary tract abnormalities were observed in 22 of 45 male neonates.
Nineteen had vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), 1 had VUR and a double collecting
system, 1 had VUR and a posterior urethral valve, and 1 had an ureteropelvic
junction stricture. Renal atrophy or scars, as demonstrated by DMSA scan, were
detected almost exclusively in neonates with VUR grade 3 and above. Only 1
neonate with VUR grade 1 had a pathologic DMSA, and the US of this male also
demonstrated renal atrophy. Escherichia coli was the pathogen in 62% (28 of 45), 
and 9 boys had bacteremia.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that US and VCUG should be performed routinely after the
initial UTI in male neonates. Renal scan should be reserved for those cases in
which the US suggests renal parenchymal damage or when VCUG detects VUR grade 3
and above.

An alternative approach to the preparation of (188)Re radiopharmaceuticals from
generator-produced [(188)ReO(4)](-): efficient synthesis of
(188)Re(V)-meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Clinical and Experimental
Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.

A new efficient approach for the preparation of (188)Re radiopharmaceuticals
starting from [(188)ReO(4)](-), produced at a carrier-free level through the
(188)W/(188)Re generator system, is described. The reaction procedure was based
on the combined action of different reagents and has been applied in detail to
the preparation of the therapeutic agent (188)Re(V)-DMSA (H(2)DMSA
[meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid]). The most efficient combination required the 
use of SnCl(2), oxalate ions, and gamma-cyclodextrin. These were reacted with
[(188)ReO(4)](-) and H(2)DMSA to afford the final radiopharmaceutical in high
radiochemical purity, at room temperature, and in weakly acidic solution. The
role played by the various reagents in the reaction was investigated. It was
found that SnCl(2) behaved as the actual reducing agent, whereas oxalate and
gamma-cyclodextrin greatly enhanced the ease of reduction of [(188)ReO(4)](-)
through the action of two hypothetical mechanisms. In the first step of the
reaction, oxalate ions gave rise to the formation of Re(VII) complexes with the
concomitant expansion of the coordination sphere of the metal. This process
strongly favored the electron transfer between Sn(2+) and Re(+7) centers, giving 
rise to intermediate reduced rhenium complexes. These species were further
stabilized by the formation of transient host-guest aggregates with
gamma-cyclodextrin and finally converted into (188)Re(V)-DMSA through simple
replacement of the coordinated ligands by H(2)DMSA.

bone scintigraphy. Thirty-four patients presenting with metastatic bone disease
(Group 1) and 12 controls with degenerative skeletal lesions (Group 2) were
studied. Conventional bone scanning and 99Tcm(V)-DMSA whole-body scanning were
performed on all patients. All scans were interpreted visually. Furthermore,
lesion-to-normal bone ratios (L/N) in vertebral metastases on the 4 and 24 h bone
scans were obtained in 58 lesions of cancer patients and in 23 benign
(degenerative) vertebral lesions of the control group. 99Tcm-MDP L/N ratios at 24
h (3.08 +/- 0.32) were significantly higher than those at 4 h (2.48 +/- 0.24) in 
the malignant foci (P < 0.001). No significant difference was observed in benign 
lesions (P > 0.05). In 167 (164 metastatic, 3 traumatic) of 186 99Tcm-MDP
positive lesions (90%) of Group 1, 99Tcm(V)-DMSA uptake was observed. The
remaining 19 lesions (10%) were 99Tcm(V)-DMSA negative. Fourteen of these 19
sites were diagnosed as benign. The remaining five foci were malignant. In four
lung cancer metastases showing no 99Tcm-MDP uptake, 99Tcm(V)-DMSA uptake was
observed. There was no 99Tcm(V)-DMSA accumulation in any of the 99Tcm-MDP
positive degenerative lesions of Group 2. All quantitatively evaluated (n = 42)
vertebral metastatic foci and two compression fractures in Group 1 showed
99Tcm(V)-DMSA accumulation and an increased 99Tcm-MDP L/N ratio at 24 h. A total 
of 36 degenerative lesions (Groups 1 and 2) and one compression fracture (Group
1) showed neither 99Tcm(V)-DMSA uptake nor an increased 99Tcm-MDP L/N ratio at 24
h. Our results indicate that quantitative 4/24 h analysis of vertebral lesions on
99Tcm-MDP scans has a similar diagnostic value to 99Tcm(V)-DMSA imaging in the
detection of bone metastases. However, the accumulation of 99Tcm(V)-DMSA in four 
lung cancer metastases showing no 99Tcm-MDP uptake is encouraging and justifies
further research in patients with proven bone metastases and negative bone scans.

Different associations of blood lead, meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA)-chelatable lead, and tibial lead levels with blood pressure in 543 former 
organolead manufacturing workers.

Schwartz BS(1), Stewart WF.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene
and Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.

In this study, the authors' objective was to determine the influence of blood
lead, meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)-chelatable lead, and tibial lead on
systolic and diastolic blood pressures and on hypertension in 543 former
organolead manufacturing workers. All workers had past exposure to inorganic and 
organic lead. The authors used linear regression to model systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure separately, and logistic regression was used for the modeling of
hypertension status (i.e., systolic blood pressure > 160 mm Hg, diastolic blood
pressure > or =96 mm Hg, or current use of antihypertensive medications). Blood
lead, DMSA-chelatable lead, and tibial lead levels had means (standard deviations
appear within parentheses) of 4.6 microg/dl (2.6 microg/dl), 19.3 microg (17.2
microg), and 14.4 microg/g (9.3 microg/g), respectively. The authors adjusted for
covariates, and they found that blood lead was a predictor of (1) both systolic
and diastolic blood pressures and (2) hypertension status in men < 58 y of age.
DMSA-chelatable lead and tibial lead were not associated with any of the blood
pressure measures. Systolic blood pressure was elevated by blood lead levels as
low as 5 microg/dl. We speculate that lead may have a transient influence on
blood pressure that is related to target dose levels obtained once release of
lead from body stores has occurred.

The etiology of renal scars in infants with pyelonephritis and vesicoureteral
reflux.

Goldman M(1), Bistritzer T, Horne T, Zoareft I, Aladjem M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics B, Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, Zerifin, Israel.

We aimed to investigate, by means of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, the
relations between vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and its degree, pyelonephritis
during infancy, and renal parenchymal findings. Seventy-four infants with
pyelonephritis, 44 girls and 30 boys (mean age at their first pyelonephritic
episode 4.12 months, median 3 months), were enrolled in the study. Voiding
cystourethrography (VCU) and ultrasonography (US) were performed within 6 weeks
following the infection. DMSA was performed at least 4 months after the urinary
tract infection (UTI). The renal parenchymal pathology was defined as focal or
multifocal defects or as a split renal uptake of less than 45%. DMSA scintigraphy
revealed that 19% (14/74) of the children had renal damage. Renal parenchymal
findings were observed only when VUR was present, and its grade was above 3/5. No
abnormality was found in 51 renal units without reflux, 9 with VUR grade 1/5, and
54 with grade 2/5. Renal pathology was observed in 9/24 renal units with VUR
grade 3, 3/8 with grade 4, and 2/2 with grade 5. No correlation was found between
renal parenchymal defects and clinical presentation of the pyelonephritis, type
of the microorganism, presence of bacteremia, or the number of recurrent
infections. In adequately treated infants, renal damage is probably due to a
reflux-associated, preexisting, congenital renal parenchymal pathology and not to
the inflammatory process. We suggest that DMSA scintigraphy should not be
performed routinely in every infant with UTI and should be reserved primarily for
children with VUR grade 3 and above.

[Comparison between scintigraphy, B-mode, and power Doppler sonography in acute
pyelonephritis in children].

Victor Pauchet, 80054 Amiens, France.

PURPOSE: Comparing Power Doppler imaging versus
technetium-dimercapto-succinic-acid (Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy in acute
pyelonephritis of childhood.
PATIENTS AND METHODS:
INCLUSION CRITERIA: First episode of urinary tract infection, clinical and
biological findings suggesting an upper lesion, absence of urological
malformation or obstruction, absence of reflux (or vesico-ureteral reflux
inferior to grade 3). Number of patients: 49, length of the study: 26 months
(from November 95 to January 98).
METHODS: Tc99m-DMSA scintigraphy (after five days), B mode and Power Doppler
imaging (on the day of admission or the following day). Systematic cystography
(day 5 to day 30).
RESULTS: In terms of positive diagnosis, scintigraphy was superior to Power
Doppler, and the latter was superior to B mode ultrasonography. Sensitivity
(scintigraphy being the gold standard) was equal for both B mode and Power
DopplerUS imaging, but combined Power Doppler and B mode US provided improved
results.
CONCLUSION: Currently, the results with Power Doppler imaging are insufficient to
replace DMSA scintigraphy. However, Power Doppler is a good complement to B mode 
US.

Multiple roles for the twin arginine leader sequence of dimethyl sulfoxide
reductase of Escherichia coli.

Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2H7,
Canada.

Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me(2)SO) reductase of Escherichia coli is a terminal electron
transport chain enzyme that is expressed under anaerobic growth conditions and is
required for anaerobic growth with Me(2)SO as the terminal electron acceptor. The
trimeric enzyme is composed of a membrane extrinsic catalytic dimer (DmsAB) and a
membrane intrinsic anchor (DmsC). The amino terminus of DmsA has a leader
sequence with a twin arginine motif that targets DmsAB to the membrane via a
novel Sec-independent mechanism termed MTT for membrane targeting and
translocation. We demonstrate that the Met-1 present upstream of the twin
arginine motif serves as the correct translational start site. The leader is
essential for the expression of DmsA, stability of the DmsAB dimer, and membrane 
targeting of the reductase holoenzyme. Mutation of arginine 17 to aspartate
abolished membrane targeting. The reductase was labile in the leader sequence
mutants. These mutants failed to support growth on glycerol-Me(2)SO minimal
medium. Replacing the DmsA leader with the TorA leader of trimethylamine N-oxide 
reductase produced a membrane-bound DmsABC with greatly reduced enzyme activity
and inefficient anaerobic respiration indicating that the twin arginine leaders
may play specific roles in the assembly of redox enzymes.

Comment in
    Arch Dis Child. 2000 Nov;83(5):457.

AIMS: To address some of the issues in the ongoing debate over the optimal
diagnostic imaging following childhood urinary tract infection (UTI), by
determining the risk of missing renal cortical scarring which would be detected
on a technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) gold standard if ultrasound
alone were used, factoring for clinical features (upper or lower tract), UTI
recurrence, and age group (infants, preschool, or school age).
METHODS: Details of UTI clinical features and recurrence were recorded for 990
children with a proven UTI, and their DMSA and ultrasound results were compared
for each kidney.
RESULTS: The risks of missing DMSA scarring varied between 0.4% (school age
children with solitary lower tract UTI) and 11.1% (infants with recurrent upper
tract UTI).
CONCLUSIONS: UTI clinical features are important in assessing the need for DMSA
imaging. Current UK imaging guidelines are endorsed, although preschool children 
with solitary lower tract UTI remain a controversial group and more attention
needs to focused on children with recurrent UTI.

Low incidence of new renal scars after ureteral reimplantation for vesicoureteral
reflux in children: a prospective study.

Author information: 
(1)Departments of Urology and Nephrology, Sydney Children's Hospital, Prince of
Wales Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.

PURPOSE: The major aim of treating vesicoureteral reflux in children is the
prevention of renal scars. Dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) is the modality of
choice for detecting renal scars. We documented the incidence of new renal
scarring and measured changes in differential renal function after ureteral
reimplantation using DMSA studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 45 boys and 98 girls with a median age of 2
years who had vesicoureteral reflux and underwent ureteral reimplantation. DMSA
scans were done preoperatively and at a median of 3.4 years postoperatively.
Maximal reflux grade was III in 84 children (59%), IV in 27 (19%) and V in 6
(4%).
RESULTS: Preoperatively DMSA studies showed scarred or contracted kidneys in 106 
of the 143 patients (74%). After reimplantation mean change in differential
function was 2.5%. New scars developed in 3 children (2%). We noted greater than 
6% decrease in relative differential function without new scarring in 7 cases
(5%).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of new renal scars in our study using DMSA was lower
than that in previous series using excretory urography and imaging. Surgical
correction of vesicoureteral reflux may offer better protection of kidneys in
childhood than previously believed.

Using technetium-99M dimercaptosuccinic acid renal cortex scintigraphy to
differentiate acute pyelonephritis from other causes of fever in patients with
spinal cord injury.

OBJECTIVES: To differentiate acute pyelonephritis (APN) from fever due to other
sources in patients with spinal cord injury by using technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal cortex scintigraphy (DMSA scan).
METHODS: A total of 24 patients with spinal cord injury were admitted with fever.
DMSA scans were performed on all patients. The final determination of the cause
of the fever was based on the medical history, physical examination, laboratory
evaluation, and imaging studies.
RESULTS: DMSA scan accurately diagnosed APN in 12 patients with inflammation on
the DMSA scan. In 5 patients with scarred lesions on the DMSA scans and in 7
patients with negative DMSA scan, the fever was attributed to other causes. The
sensitivity and specificity of the DMSA scan for detecting APN were both 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: The DMSA scan is a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of fever in
patients with SCI.

Antidotal effects of 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS) and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on the organotoxicity of dibutyltin
dichloride (DBTC) in rats.

1. Dialkyltin compounds have been widely used in industry and agriculture, mainly
as biocides, catalysts and plast stabilizer. In dependence on the length of the
alkyl chains these organotins exert toxic effects on the immune system, the bile 
duct, liver and pancreas. It has been supposed that similar to organoarsenic the 
toxicity of the dialkyltin compounds is related to reactions with biological
dithiol groups. Therefore, in the present study, the antidotal effects of
2,3-dimercapto-propane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) on the organotoxic effects of dibutyltin dichloride (DBTC, single
administration of 27 micromol kg(-1) b.w. i.v.) in rats were studied using
different doses (100 and 500 micromol kg(-1) b.w.) and routes of administration
(i.p. and p.o.) of both chelators. Several parameters of organotoxicity (thymus
weight and cellularity, bile duct diameter, histological lesions of pancreas and 
liver, activities of amylase, lipase and alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and
hyaluronic acid in serum) were measured from 6 h to 8 weeks. 2. DMPS and DMSA
diminished the DBTC induced bile duct, pancreas and liver lesions stronger than
the thymus atrophy. Moreover, the development of a fibrosis of the pancreas and a
cirrhosis of liver several weeks after single administration of DBTC to rats was 
inhibited by DMPS and DMSA. The antidotal effects on serum parameter were
observed after both administration routes of the chelators. DMPS was more
effective than DMSA in most measured parameters. The decrease in the biliary
excretion of organotin by DMPS and DMSA seems to be the reason for the pronounced
protective effects of DMPS and DMSA on bile duct, pancreas and liver. 3. For the 
treatment of poisonings with dibutyltin compounds, the administration of DMPS or 
DMSA can be recommended.

Although the majority of patients with vesicoureteric reflux presents DMSA scan
alterations, parenchimal renal scars are found also in children without
vesicoureteric reflux. Two clinical cases of reflux nephropathy without evidence 
of reflux are presented. Several explanations could be advocated to justify this 
picture, including haematogenous source of infection, inadequate timing and/or
procedure of cystouretrography, intermittency of reflux, ascending bacteria,
previous presence of reflux, and appearance of controlateral reflux during the
natural history of a monolateral documented reflux. Tailored diagnostic and
therapeutic strategy should discussed for each patient.

Bone-scan-like pattern with 99Tcm(V)-DMSA scintigraphy in patients with
osteomalacia and primary hyperparathyroidism.

The aim of this study was to assess the role of 99Tcm(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(99Tcm(V)-DMSA) scintigraphy in the evaluation of patients with metabolic bone
disease. The study group comprised eight women aged 17-72 years, six with
osteomalacia and two with primary hyperparathyroidism. Six patients were imaged
scintigraphically before their treatments were started, whereas the other two
underwent treatment during the time of examination. All six patients who had not 
previously been treated had prominent skeletal 99Tcm(V)-DMSA uptake, revealing a 
bone-scan-like pattern. In the two patients receiving medical therapy, their
99Tcm(V)-DMSA scans revealed a normal physiological distribution. Many of the
fracture and pseudofracture sites detected on bone scans were also discerned with
99Tcm(V)-DMSA scintigraphy. Our results suggest that 99Tcm(V)-DMSA scintigraphy
might have the potential as a screening method in patients with metabolic bone
disease.

Coexisting renal vein thrombosis and bilateral adrenal hemorrhage:
renoscintigraphic demonstration.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Ube, Japan.

A rare case of simultaneous renal vein thrombosis and bilateral adrenal
hemorrhage is presented, showing the utility of Tc-99m DTPA and DMSA renal scans 
to identify the condition and to assess renal function. The characteristic
appearances of suprarenal tracer-free areas encircled by peripheral radioactive
rims over the inferiorly displaced kidneys on a Tc-99m DTPA renal scan, and that 
of the flattened upper poles of the kidneys on a Tc-99m DMSA scan, were
pathognomonic and strongly indicative of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. These two 
scans also showed markedly diminished tracer uptake in the poorly functioning
right thrombosed kidney. Follow-up imaging using these two renal scans well
demonstrated the functional and morphologic alterations and recovery of the
kidneys.

Antioxidants attenuate gentamicin-induced free radical formation in vitro and
ototoxicity in vivo: D-methionine is a potential protectant.

Sha SH(1), Schacht J.

Author information: 
(1)Kresge Hearing Research Institute, Department of Otolaryngology, University of
Michigan, 1301 East Ann Street, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

We have recently suggested antioxidant therapy against aminoglycoside-induced
hearing loss based on the hypothesis of a redox-active aminoglycoside-iron
complex causing ototoxicity. The present study compares seven antioxidants and
iron chelators for their ability to attenuate gentamicin-induced free radical
generation in vitro and ototoxicity in guinea pig in vivo. Free radical formation
by gentamicin was measured by chemiluminescence detection both in a non-enzymatic
system in vitro and in cell culture. Deferoxamine, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, or
salicylic acid suppressed gentamicin-induced luminescence in both tests. This
indicated the usefulness of the assay as a screen for potential protectants since
these agents had previously been shown to attenuate gentamicin-induced
ototoxicity in vivo. Histidine and D-methionine, amino acids with chelating and
antioxidant properties, also suppressed gentamicin-mediated luminosity both in
vitro and in cell culture. In contrast, the metal chelators succimer (2,
3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)) and trientine (N, N'-bis[2-aminoethyl]-1,2
ethanediamine) promoted free radical formation and were excluded from further
studies. Histidine and D-methionine were then administered to guinea pigs
receiving concurrent treatment with gentamicin (120 mg/kgx19 days). Threshold
shifts induced by gentamicin were significantly attenuated by twice-daily
injections of D-methionine. Once-daily injections of histidine or D-methionine
were less effective, pointing to the importance of pharmacokinetics in
antioxidant protection in vivo. The study presents a simple screening system for 
agents with the potential to attenuate gentamicin-induced hearing loss. It also
supports the hypothesis of free radical formation as an underlying cause of
gentamicin ototoxicity.

Contribution of 99Tcm-DMSA scintigraphy to aetiological diagnosis in renal
transplant recipients with impaired renal function.

Garin E(1), Devillers A, Rivalan J, Girault S, Moisan A, Le Cloirec J, Bourguet
P.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Centre Eugène Marquis, Rennes, France.

Routine 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy was performed in a
series of 24 kidney transplant recipients with impaired renal function.
Diagnostic findings on planar and tomoscintigraphic acquisitions obtained 3 and 4
h after the injection of 130-140 MBq 99Tcm-DMSA were compared with the diagnosis 
established by fine-needle biopsy in 13 patients and by clinical course and other
examinations (ultrasonography, bacteriology) in 11 patients. Renal scintigraphy
demonstrated segmental defects in patients with rejection (n = 2/6),
immunosuppressor nephrotoxicity (n = 2/6), acute pyelonephritis (n = 3/3), renal 
artery stenosis (n = 1/1) and obstructive lymphocele (n = 1/1). Diffuse lack of
uptake was observed in one patient with severe renal failure. The scintigram was 
normal in 14 patients, including three with lesions histologically compatible
with graft rejection or immunosuppressor nephrotoxicity. 99Tcm-DMSA was thus
found to contribute little to the differential diagnosis between graft rejection 
and immunosuppressor nephrotoxicity. However, it may be useful for identifying
specific disease states, particularly acute pyelonephritis, seen as
well-delimited systematized defects. 99Tcm-DMSA scintigraphy could also be used
in late follow-up after pyelonephritis in renal transplant recipients.

The role of Tc-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy in the evaluation of superscan on bone
scintigraphy.

Yüksel D(1), Ilgan S, Arslan N, Uğur O, Oztürk E, Bayhan H.

Author information: 
(1)Pamukkale University Medical Faculty, Department of Nuclear Medicine, Denizli,
Turkey.

PURPOSE: This study evaluated the biodistribution of Tc-99m (V) DMSA in patients 
with superscans on bone imaging and defined its role in differentiating the
underlying cause.
METHODS: Nine patients (five with metastatic and four with metabolic bone
disease) with classical superscans were entered into the study. All patients had 
the necessary radiologic and biochemical studies and a final diagnosis was
reached accordingly. Tc-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy was performed 1 week after
Tc-99m MDP whole-body bone imaging.
RESULTS: In four of five patients with widespread skeletal metastases, Tc-99m (V)
DMSA scan showed diffusely increased bone uptake. In the remaining patient, the
Tc-99m (V) DMSA scan showed a normal distribution pattern. All patients with
metabolic bone disease had increased bone uptake on Tc-99m (V) DMSA scans.
CONCLUSION: Tc-99m (V) DMSA shows increased bone uptake in patients having a
superscan appearance in metastatic or metabolic bone disease. Tc-99m (V) DMSA
imaging may play a role in the evaluation of patients with equivocal bone scan
findings for a superscan.

Unilateral acute renal cortical necrosis: correlative imaging.

Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.

Bilateral acute cortical necrosis is a rare form of acute renal failure
characterized by necrosis of the renal cortex and sparing of the medulla. Little 
information on the imaging presentation of bilateral acute renal cortical
necrosis is available. The enhanced CT appearance is pathognomonic and
diagnostic. The unilateral presentation of acute cortical necrosis is extremely
rare, and no imaging methods have been described. The authors chose to apply
scintigraphic evaluation to this unique condition complementary to CT to confirm 
the diagnosis. Mercaptoacetylglycine (T3) was selected to assess tubular damage, 
in contrast to the pure glomerular agent DTPA. Evidence of some tubular function 
and clear delineation of the shrunken kidney was found. Conversely, in the DTPA
study the kidney was not visualized. A DMSA scan was performed for assessment of 
viability of the renal cortex and showed a photopenic halo around the small area 
of the viable cortex of the upper pole. The halo sign represents a cortical loss.
The visualization of the upper pole as evidence of cortical viability as a
consequence of collateral blood flow from capsular vessels was seen on
angiography. Radiographic and scintigraphic correlation of this rare condition
may be an effective means to confirm the diagnosis and to establish the extent of
involvement. However, contrast CT remains the preferred method in the diagnosis
of acute cortical necrosis.

Reappraisal of Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy for follow up in children with
vesicoureteral reflux.

Medicine,Sapporo, Japan.

We reviewed Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)
in order to assess whether repeated Tc-99m DMSA scans are necessary for the
follow up of these patients. Ninety-seven children who were followed up for more 
than one year (1-7.4 years, average 2.8 years) after the first DMSA scan were
included in the study. Fifty-one patients had been diagnosed as primary VUR and
46 as secondary VUR. Age at the first examination ranged from 0 to 14 years
(average 5.1 years). Planar images were taken 2 hours after injection. The %
renal uptake per injected dose (%RU) was calculated from posterior images.
Kidneys in 11 patients (11.3%) changed morphologically during the follow up. Of
these, new photon deficient areas (PD) were detected in only 4 patients (4.1%).
All of these 4 patients had neurogenic bladder and were managed with
self-catheterization. Of the remaining 7 patients, cortical thinning progressed
in 5 patients (5.2%) and PDs resolved in 3 patients (3.1%). In one of these 7
patients, PD resolved in one kidney and cortical thinning progressed in the
contralateral kidney. Of 97 patients reviewed, % RU decreased more than 20%
during the follow up in 6 patients (6.2%). All were diagnosed as secondary VUR
due to neurogenic bladder. %RU decreased only in the contracted kidneys at the
initial scan. Two of them underwent renal transplantation because of severe renal
failure. In conclusion, new PD rarely developed and % RU decreased in only a few 
patients during the follow up of children with VUR. Repeated Tc-99m DMSA
scintigraphy therefore seems to have little benefit in the follow up of children 
with VUR. It should be performed in selected patients with high risk of urinary
tract infection or renal failure.

Renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA has been quantified by various methods. The aim of
this study is to obtain a normal value for 99mTc-DMSA renal uptake calculated by 
the posterior view method and age variation, and to assess its clinical validity.
Scintigrams of 238 children (0-12 years) with 99mTc-DMSA were reviewed. All the
children had a clinical history of primary vesicoureteral reflux and/or
neurogenic bladder, ureteral or urethral anomalies. Their kidneys were divided
into two groups, "normal" and "abnormal" according to their scintigraphic
findings and split renal functions. Percent renal uptake per injected dose (% RU)
was quantitated from planar images at 2 hours after injection of an age-adjusted 
dose (26-95 MBq) of 99mTc-DMSA. Calculated total % RU, individual % RU of the
right and left kidneys (mean +/- sd) in patients with normal kidneys were 40.7
+/- 5.0%, 20.2 +/- 3.0%, 20.4 +/- 2.7%, respectively. There was no significant
correlation between % RU and age (r = 0.231). Longitudinal variation in the % RU 
in 9 patients ranged from 1.2% to 18%. Our conventional method for quantifyng %
RU is simple, practical and feasible in routine clinical practice, especially for
children under follow up.

of Athens, Thibon and Levadias St,Goudi, Athens 115-27, Greece. march193@hol.gr

OBJECTIVE: Experimental evidence suggests that neutrophils and their metabolites 
play an important role in the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis. The aim of this
study was to investigate the diagnostic value of polymorphonuclear
elastase-a(1)-antitrypsin complex (E-a(1)-Pi) for the detection of acute
pyelonephritis in children.
METHODS: Eighty-three patients, 29 boys and 54 girls, 25 days to 14 years of age,
with first-time symptomatic urinary tract infection were prospectively studied.
Fifty-seven healthy children served as controls. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scan and voiding cystourethrography were performed in all patients. Plasma and
urinary E-a(1)-Pi, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR), neutrophil count, urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG),
N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase b (NAG b), and creatinine levels were measured in
all patients on admission and 3 days after the introduction of antibiotics. The
same markers were also measured in the control subjects.
RESULTS: Planar DMSA scintigraphy demonstrated changes of acute pyelonephritis in
30 of 83 children (group A). It was normal in the remaining 53 children (group
B). The sex and age distributions were not significantly different between the 2 
groups, as well as between the patients and the control subjects (group C).
Nineteen of the 53 children with a normal DMSA had body temperature >/=38 degrees
C, whereas all but 4 children with abnormal DMSA had temperature >/=38 degrees C.
Therefore, the temperature was significantly different between these 2 groups.
The sensitivity and specificity of fever (>/=38 degrees C) as an indicator of
renal involvement based on isotopic findings were 86% and 64%, respectively.
Given the significant number of the febrile children with normal DMSA
scintiscans, group B was subdivided into B(1) with 19 febrile children (14 boys
and 5 girls) and B(2) with 34 children whose body temperature was below 38
degrees C (8 boys and 26 girls). The sex and age distribution was significantly
different between groups B(1) and B(2). The mean age of group B(1) was.78 years
(range: 28 days to 9 years; median:.25 years; standard deviation: 2.1). All but 1
child in this group were younger than 1 year of age. In contrast, in group B(2), 
there were only 4 infants, the remaining 30 children were older than 2.5 years
(mean age: 6 years; median: 7 years; standard deviation: 3.5; range: 34 days to
12 years). The mean duration of fever before hospital admission was 2.8 days for 
group A and 1.8 days for group B(1). This difference was not statistically
significant. Similarly, body temperature was not significantly different between 
these 2 groups. The distribution of plasma E-a(1)-Pi values was normal in the
control subjects. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma E-a(1)-Pi, as an
indicator of renal involvement, were 96% and 50%, respectively, taking the 95th
percentile of the reference range as a cutoff value. However, considering as a
cutoff value the level of 72 microg/dL (95th percentile of group B(2)), its
sensitivity and specificity were 74% and 86%, respectively. Plasma E-a(1)-Pi
levels were significantly elevated in group A compared with group B and in both
groups, the plasma E-a(1)-Pi values were significantly higher than in the control
subjects. A significant difference also was noticed between group A and each of
the subgroups B(1) and B(2) and also between the subgroups themselves. Plasma
E-a(1)-Pi concentrations correlated significantly with neutrophil count in groups
A (r =.3), B (r =.4), and B(2) (r =.46), but the correlation was not significant 
in group B(1.) ESR levels showed, among the different groups, similar differences
with those of E-a(1)-Pi values. Unlike E-a(1)-Pi, CRP levels were comparable
between groups A and B(1), which both consisted of febrile children. Neutrophil
count was not significantly different between subgroups B(1) and B(2). (ABSTRACT

[The captopril test--an aid in the detection of scarring nephropathy as a cause
of arterial hypertension in children].

[Article in Serbian]

Renal scarring with and without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been now
recognized as an important cause of paediatric hypertension for many years [1-5].
However, its pathogenesis has still remained uncleared. The widespread concept
implicated the activation of renin-angiotensin system finding a powerfull support
in higher peripheral plasma renin activity (PRA) in children with reflux
nephropathy than in controls [6, 7] and in beneficial antihypertensive effects of
ACE inhibitors. The latter, in form of captopril, has also been used in captopril
test and in renal scintigraphy and isotope renography following the
administration of captopril to provide evidence for renin dependent hypertension 
[8, 9]. Published studies of captopril test have centred on the identification of
renovascular as opposed to essential hypertension [10-18, 20-22]. The aim of our 
study was to assess the usefulness of captopril test in differentiation between
hypertensive children with renal scarring from those with essential hypertension.
We studied blood pressure (BP) and PRA responses to a single dose of captopril in
two groups of hypertensive children. Group A consisted of 29 patients, 14 boys
and 15 girls, who had renal scaring as demonstrated by renal 99mTc
dimercaptosuccinid acid scan (99m Tc DMSA) and/or intravenous pyelography. Group 
B included 19 patients, 19 boys and 10 girls who had arterial hypertension, while
clinical examination excluded renal and other definable causes of BP elevation,
and they were therefore considered to have essential hypertension. At the time of
the study all patients had normal glomerular filtration rate and were not salt
depleted. They did not receive any antihypertensive medication for at least two
weeks. The test was performed in the morning in fasting sitting patients. At the 
start of the test a small vein in the hand or forearm was cannulated to permit
blood sampling. BP was measured 10, 20, and 30 minutes before captopril
administration to get baseline BP (mean of these three measurements) and to allow
the children to become accustomed to the test procedure. A single oral dose of
captopril 0.64 +/- 0.04 mg/kg body weight was given to patients from group A and 
almost the same dose of captopril, 0.63 +/- 0.05 mg/kg body weight, to patients
from group B. The patients remained sitting and BP was measured every 15 minutes 
during an hour. Blood for PRA was drown in the sitting position (17 patients from
group A and 16 patients from group B) before and one hour after the dose of
captopril. Samples of blood for basal PRA were collected from 16 patients from
group A and in 14 patients from in B in lying position after waking up in the
morning. PRA was measured by radioimmunoassay using a commercially available kit,
SB-REN 2, from CIS Bio International. According to the criteria of Muller et al. 
[10] the captopril test was positive if the post-captopril PRA (ng/ml/h) was
greater than or equal to 12 with an increase of greater than or equal to 10 and
relative increase of greater than or equal to 15% (400% if initial PRA was < 3). 
The results of our study are presented in Tables 1 and 2 and in Graphs 1 and 2.
The age of patients, doses of captopril, initial BP and PRA before the use of
captopril did not much differ between studied groups. Fall of BP and PRA increase
were highly significant (p < 0.001) both in group A and group B. However, the
hypotensive reaction of diastolic BP and MAP were more pronounced in group A
(14.45 +/- 1.67% and 15.81 +/- 1.62%) than in group B (6.95 +/- 2.21% and 8.96
+/- 1.75%; p < 0.01), but there were no significant differences in PRA and
systolic BP changes and positive results of captopril test between the studied
groups. Hypotensive responses of diastolic BP and MAP greater than 10% of initial
values were found to be more frequent in group A (79.32% and 79.31%) than in
group B (26.61% and 31.57 degrees %; p < 0.001 and p < 0.01). Diastolic BP and
MAP were directly related to the dose of cap

Conflicting opinions have been expressed regarding reproducibility in
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) planar renal image interpretation. The
purpose of this investigation was to determine the level of interobserver
variability among a large group of Belgian nuclear medicine physicians who
evaluated a randomly selected series of DMSA planar scintigraphic examinations
performed on children and adults.METHODS: All Belgian nuclear medicine centers (n
= 82) were invited to participate in a reproducibility study on 99mTc-DMSA
scintigraphy. 99mTc-DMSA scans obtained on 10 adults and 40 children were
randomly selected from the databases of 2 hospitals. Those participating in this 
investigation (65 centers = 79%) received a series of computer disks containing
50 99mTc-DMSA studies. To avoid potential problems related to unfamiliar display,
the disks were formatted to be interpretable using the participants' own computer
systems. Each participant was then free to use his or her usual display (hard
copies, contrast enhancement, color scale, gray scale, and so forth). For each
kidney, the observers had to choose between the following answers: normal,
abnormal, equivocal, and lack of quality.
RESULTS: Forty-two responses were obtained from a wide variety of institutions
and from observers with different levels of experience in interpreting 99mTc-DMSA
scintigraphy. Altogether, the following data were obtained: 60.8% normal, 25.2%
abnormal, 7.0% equivocal, and 3.2% lack of quality. The median percentage of
agreement (overall reproducibility) for the 42 observers was 92%. When the
results of all 42 observers were compared, the median agreements on normality and
abnormality were 93.5% and 90.5%, respectively. In a small number (n = 4) of
kidneys, reproducibility was poor and ranged from 51% to 70%. Except for 2
outliers, all observers had almost the same level of performance.
CONCLUSION: A large number of Belgian nuclear medicine physicians participated in
evaluating a large randomly selected sample of 99mTc-DMSA studies, and excellent 
interobserver agreement was found.

[A comparative study of the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux in childhood: a
review of a series of 636 refluxing units].

[Article in Spanish]

Coruña.

A number of 411 pediatric patients (636 refluxing renal units) diagnosed as
having vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) were evaluated in our Hospital between 1985
and 1997. All the patients were divided in two historic groups based on the
therapeutical modalities employed. The children included in group A (between 1985
and 1995) were medically or surgically treated according to the grade of reflux. 
In the group B (between 1995 and 1997), the endoscopic treatment was added to
previous. All cases underwent urine cultures, renal ultrasonography, voiding
cystourethrography and isotopic gammagraphy with DMSA scan. In some patients were
performed radionuclide renography with DTPA or MAG-3 to assess renal function. We
consider that medical management is required in low grade reflux (I and II) but
patients with high grade reflux (IV and V) clearly benefit from early ureteral
surgical reimplantation (Cohen technique). In our series, patients with reflux
grade III are treated endoscopically with Teflon or PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane)
with resolution of reflux in 82-92% after first injection.

Efficacy of succimer chelation for reducing brain lead in a primate model of
human lead exposure.

Cremin JD Jr(1), Luck ML, Laughlin NK, Smith DR.

Author information:

95064, USA.

The extent to which succimer (meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid [DMSA], Chemet)
reduces brain lead (Pb) levels may be a primary consideration in evaluating its
efficacy for reducing neurotoxicity. Clinical research in this area has been
hampered by the need to use blood Pb levels as the index of treatment efficacy,
despite the fact that brain Pb level is the exposure parameter of greater
relevance to cognitive outcomes. Here, a nonhuman primate model of human Pb
exposure was used to determine: (1) The efficacy of oral succimer for reducing
brain Pb derived from chronic or recent exposures, and (2) The extent to which
blood Pb levels reflect brain Pb prior to and following chelation. Adult rhesus
monkeys were chronically exposed to Pb orally for 5 weeks to reach and maintain a
target blood Pb level of 35-40 microg/dL. Chelation of Pb from recent exposures
was assessed using a stable (204)Pb isotope tracer administered over 4 days prior
to treatment. Immediately prior to chelation, a prefrontal cortex (PFC) biopsy
was collected to determine pretreatment brain Pb levels. Subsequently, monkeys
were assigned to vehicle (n = 5) or succimer (n = 6, 30 mg/kg/day x 5 days
followed by 20 mg/kg/day x 14 days) groups. Blood and brain PFC, frontal lobe
(FL), hippocampus (H), and striatum (S) were analyzed for total Pb and (204)Pb
tracer concentrations by magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectrometry. There were no measurable differences in brain Pb concentrations
between the succimer and vehicle groups, indicating that succimer treatment was
not efficacious in reducing brain Pb levels. In contrast, the cessation of Pb
exposure significantly reduced brain (PFC) Pb ( approximately 34%) when compared 
to pretreatment levels (succimer and vehicle groups). Pb concentrations also
varied among brain regions (PFC > FL approximately H > S). Finally, pretreatment 
PFC Pb concentrations were significantly correlated with the integrated blood Pb 
level (AUC) over the Pb exposure period, but not with the single pretreatment
blood Pb collected concurrently with the PFC biopsy. Following treatment, blood
Pb levels correlated only with Pb in the PFC, and not the other brain regions
measured (FL, H, S). These data indicate that, under the conditions of this
study, succimer treatment did not reduce brain Pb levels beyond the cessation of 
Pb exposure alone. Moreover, a single blood Pb measurement may be a poor
predictor of brain Pb levels, reflecting limitations in the use of blood Pb level
as an indicator of treatment efficacy.

Tc-99m (V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been used to image various kinds of
tumors. However, from a review of the literature, it has never been applied to
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Low uptake of Tc-99m (V)-DMSA has been
demonstrated in normal liver tissue, thus, Tc-99m (V)-DMSA may be useful for the 
detection of HCC. Nine male patients with focal nodular HCC were studied with
sequential X-ray CT, Tc-99m (V)-DMSA and Tc-99m phytate liver scan. Our data
showed that eight patients had increased uptake of Tc-99m (V) DMSA in HCC. Four
cases demonstrated higher Tc-99m (V) DMSA uptake in HCC than in adjacent liver,
and four cases demonstrated HCC uptake equal to liver uptake. One case showed no 
uptake of Tc-99m (V) DMSA in HCC. The detection sensitivity of Tc-99m (V)-DMSA
was 88.9%. From our early results, Tc-99m (V)-DMSA is a readily available tumor
imaging agent that appears to accumulate in HCC.

Tc-99m DMSA renal scan in first-time versus recurrent urinary tract
infection-yield and patterns of abnormalities.

Loutfi I(1), Al-Zaabi K, Elgazzar AH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Kuwait University and Mubarak Hospital,
Ministry of Public Health, Safat. loutfi@hsc.kuniv.edu.kw

PURPOSE: To determine the yield and patterns of abnormalities noted by Tc-99m
DMSA renal imaging in cases of first-time versus recurrent urinary tract
infections (UTIs) in children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 101 Tc-99m DMSA studies performed for 52
first-time and 49 recurrent UTIs in 99 children during a period of 1 year. The
average age of the patients was 4.4 years, and the female:male ratio was 7:1.
Static images of the kidneys were acquired 2 hours after injection of Tc-99m DMSA
in anterior, posterior, and right and left posterior oblique views. SPECT was
performed in 9% of the cases. The studies were scored as normal or abnormal.
RESULTS: The yield of abnormal scans in first-time UTIs was 22 (42%) and in
recurrent UTI 27 (55%). Three categories of abnormalities were noted: 1) renal
cortical defects (55% of the abnormal scans in first-time UTIs and 59% of the
abnormal scans in recurrent UTIs; P = 0.40); 2) dilated pelvicalyceal system (27%
of the abnormal studies in first-time UTIs and 63% of the abnormal studies in
recurrent UTIs; P < 0.01); and 3) renal swelling showing disproportionate
function with size (41% of the abnormal scans in first-time UTIs and 22% of the
abnormal scans in recurrent UTIs; P = 0.21).
CONCLUSIONS: The high yield of renal abnormalities by Tc-99m DMSA scanning
emphasizes the importance of testing all cases of UTI, including patients with a 
first-time infection. Documentation of the pattern of abnormalities may help in
planning for subsequent management of UTIs in these patients.

Contralateral reflux after unilateral ureteral reimplantation--preexistent rather
than new-onset reflux.

Liu C(1), Chin T, Wei C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taipei, Taiwan,
Republic of China.

PURPOSE: The authors studied the preoperative Technetium 99m-dimercaptosuccinic
acid renal scan (DMSA) of patients undergoing unilateral vesicoureteral
antireflux surgery to compare the amount of renal scarring between the refluxing 
and the contralateral renal units. They sought to determine whether postoperative
contralateral vesicoureteral reflux was preexistent or new onset.
METHODS: Sixty-eight patients who underwent unilateral vesicoureteral antireflux 
surgery and had preoperative DMSA and postoperative voiding cystourethrography
(VCUG) examinations were studied. Preoperative DMSA results were analyzed to
determine the amount of renal scarring in each kidney.
RESULTS: Sixty-four (94.1%) ipsilateral refluxing renal units had renal scars. Of
the 68 contralateral renal units, scars were noted in 28 (41.2%). The rate of
nonscar was 4 of 68 (5.9%) in reflux kidneys, which was significantly lower than 
40 of 64 (62.5%, excluding 4 with a history of resolved reflux) in nonreflux
kidneys (P<.001). Of 40 contralateral nonscarred kidneys, 1 of 40 (2.5%) had
subsequent reflux, which was significantly lower than 5 of 28 (17.9%) of scarred 
kidneys (P<.005). Six patients (8.8%) had contralateral reflux, and 1 of them had
a history of resolved reflux. Of the 6 contralateral kidneys with severe scarring
involving 3 poles or contracted, 4 of 6 (66.7%) had subsequent reflux.
CONCLUSIONS: Scar in the contralateral kidney seen on DMSA scan seems to predict 
contralateral reflux after unilateral antireflux surgery. The contralateral
reflux may be preexistent. Postoperative VCUG should be performed routinely for
patients who have contralateral renal scars. In patients with a history of
contralateral reflux or severe contralateral renal scar, simultaneous
contralateral ureteral reimplantation should be considered.

Vesico-ureteric reflux and other risk factors for renal damage: identification of
high- and low-risk children.

Jakobsson B(1), Jacobson SH, Hjalmås K.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatrics, Huddinge University Hospital, Sweden.

This article reviews the literature with respect to various risk factors for
permanent renal damage in children with urinary tract infection. Vesico-ureteric 
reflux is an important risk factor, but renal damage can occur in the absence of 
reflux. Renal damage does not always occur in the presence of gross reflux. Renal
scars always develop at the same site as a previous infection in the kidney.
Recurrent pyelonephritis and delay in therapy increase the likelihood of renal
damage, although it is not known how long a delay is dangerous to the human
kidney. Recent studies using 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy have not confirmed the findings of previous studies showing that
children below 1 y of age are more vulnerable to renal damage. It is more likely 
that all children run the risk of renal scarring in cases of acute
pyelonephritis. The role of bladder pressure is still not entirely understood.
Therefore more studies are needed in order to determine the relationship between 
high voiding pressures in some, otherwise healthy, children with urinary tract
infection and renal scarring. The importance of bacterial virulence in the
development of renal scarring is unclear. DMSA scintigraphy and voiding
cystourethrography are the most reliable tools for identifying children at risk
of renal scarring. As a single method DMSA scintigraphy appears to be better than
voiding cystourethrography.

Imaging of renal scarring.

Stokland E(1), Hellström M, Jakobsson B, Sixt R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatric Radiology, The Queen Silvia Children's Hospital,
Göteborg University, Sweden.

Children with urinary tract infection should be investigated and followed up, as 
those with pyelonephritis may develop renal scarring. In this review, after
discussing the advantages and disadvantages of various imaging modalities for
diagnosis of renal scarring, it is concluded that DMSA scintigraphy and urography
can both be used to detect significant renal scarring. With DMSA scintigraphy,
small renal lesions (functional uptake defects) not seen at urography will also
be detected. The long-term clinical significance of these lesions is, as yet,
unknown. A normal DMSA scintigraphy after infection indicates low risk for
clinically significant damage. In order to allow acute, reversible lesions to
first disappear, a follow-up DMSA examination should not be performed until at
least 6 mo after the acute infection. Ultrasonography in isolation cannot be
recommended for the diagnosis of renal scarring.

Protection against cis-diamminedichloroplatinum-induced nephrotoxicity by
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in rats.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacy, Miyazaki Medical College Hospital, Japan.

The present study was designed to examine the usefulness of
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) for the purpose of reducing
cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (DDP)-induced nephrotoxicity and effective clinical 
use of DDP and safe. The effectiveness of DMSA on the DDP-excretion in rat kidney
was observed by measuring the platinum concentration using Atomic Absorption
Instrument. Co-administration of DMSA (1.0 or 2.0 mmol/kg) 1 hour after DDP
injection (20 mumol/kg) showed more decrease in the platinum concentration than
that immediately after DDP injection. The alleviating effect of DMSA on DDP
toxicity was evaluated by lipid peroxidation, enzymatic antioxidants, and
glutathione levels. The administration of DDP alone caused a significant increase
in lipid peroxidation and significant decreases in enzymatic antioxidants and
glutathione levels in the kidney. Co-administration of DMSA (2.0 mmol/kg) 1 hour 
after DDP injection showed the most effective reduction of these enzymatic
damages caused by DDP. These findings suggested that the co-administration of
DMSA (2.0 mmol/kg) 1 hour after DDP injection leads DDP to effective excrete from
renal tissue and suppresses the lipid peroxide reaction and results in reduction 
of nephrotoxicity.

Quantitative SPET 99Tcm-DMSA uptake by the kidneys: age-related decline in
healthy males.

Groshar D(1), Gorenberg M, Osamah H.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.

To evaluate if 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99Tcm-DMSA) uptake by the kidneys
is related to age and creatinine clearance in males with normal renal function,
quantitative single photon emission tomography (SPET) of DMSA uptake by the
kidneys was performed in 18 volunteers aged 20-79 years. The quantitative uptake 
of DMSA in the right kidney was 13.9 +/- 2.9% and in the left kidney 14.2 +/-
3.0%. There was no statistically significant difference between left and right
kidney uptake (t = 1.2, N.S.). Global kidney uptake (right + left) was 28.1 +/-
5.9%. There was a statistically significant age-related decline in global DMSA
uptake. The estimated DMSA uptake (%) was given by -0.27 x age + 42 (r = -0.87, P
< 0.001). A good correlation was found between creatinine clearance and global
DMSA uptake (r = 0.87, y = 2.8x + 28.3, P < 0.001). The results suggest that
normal values of DMSA uptake by the kidneys are age-dependent.

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid induces calcium transients in cultured rhesus
monkey kidney cells.

State University, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.

The maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is critical to many cellular
functions that rely on the calcium ion as a messenger. While attempting to
characterize the effects of lead on intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) in
LLC-MK2 Rhesus Monkey kidney cells, we observed that treatment with the metal
chelating drug, meso-2,3-dimer-captosuccinic acid (DMSA) evoked transient
increases in [Ca2+]i. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the Ca2+ indicator 
dye Fura-2 and a dual wavelength fluorescence imaging system. In the presence of 
2 mM extracellular Ca2+, DMSA treatment caused a concentration-dependent (15-500 
microM) transient increase in [Ca2+]i returning to baseline levels within 30-60
s. Pharmacologic concentrations of DMSA (30 microM) stimulated a three-fold
increase in [Ca2+]i, which was spatiotemporally comparable to Ca2+ transients
induced by other calcium agonists. Depletion of inositol trisphosphate
(IP3)-sensitive [Ca2+]i stores with the smooth endoplasmic reticulum
calcium-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin did not prevent DMSA-elicited
increases in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that Ca2+ mobilized by DMSA was either
extracellular or from an non-IP3 releasable Ca2+ pool. Treatment with
glutathione, cysteine, or 2-mercaptoethanol caused similar but not identical
calcium transients. Adenosine-5'-trisphosphate (ATP) also elicited transient
increases in [Ca2+]i similar to those of DMSA. No transient increases in [Ca2+]i 
were elicited by DMSA or ATP in the absence of extracellular calcium. These data 
indicate that DMSA and other sulfhydryl compounds trigger an influx of
extracellular calcium, suggesting a previously unobserved and unanticipated
interaction between DMSA and the Ca2+ messenger system.

Risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infection in preschool children.

Panaretto K(1), Craig J, Knight J, Howman-Giles R, Sureshkumar P, Roy L.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: Children with urinary tract infections (UTI) are at risk of renal
scarring which may lead to impaired renal function and hypertension. This study
examines the risk factors that predispose to recurrent UTI in children and the
role of recurrent UTI in renal scarring.
METHODOLOGY: A group of 290 children under 5 years of age with a first
symptomatic UTI were studied. Micturating cystourethrogram and dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy were performed at entry, and DMSA was repeated 1
year later. Two hundred and sixty-one children (90%) were followed up at 1 year.
RESULTS: There were 46 confirmed recurrent infections in 34 children, a
recurrence rate of 12%. Multiple recurrence occurred in 14/34 (34%) children. Age
of less than 6 months on entry independently predicted for recurrent UTI (odds
ratio (OR): 2.9)). Compliance with prophylactic antibiotics fell throughout the
year of follow up. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was present in 14/34 (34%) of the 
group with recurrent UTI, 69/256 (27%) without recurrence. Urinary tract
infection was significantly associated with bilateral and intrarenal reflux;
grade 3-5 reflux independently predicted for recurrent UTI (OR: 3.5). Recurrent
UTI was significantly associated with high grade DMSA defects on entry, renal
parenchymal defects at 1 year follow up, and new defects at 1 year.
CONCLUSION: The independent risk factors for recurrent UTI identified by this
study were an age of less than 6 months at the index UTI and grade 3-5 VUR. These
findings suggest more selective targeting may minimize problems associated with
prophylaxis and improve outcomes for children with urine infection.

[Bladder with non-coordinated voiding: urodynamics and clinical correlations].

[Article in Spanish]

Martín-Crespo Izquierdo R(1), Luque Mialdea R.

Author information: 
(1)Unidad de Urodinámica, Hospital Ntra. Sra. del Rosario, Madrid.

25 children (female) with urodynamically proven non-coordinated voiding were
followed prospectively. The objective was to study the changes of urodynamic
pattern and its clinical correlation after voiding reeducation and
pharmacological treatment. All patients presented with urinary tract infections
and voiding disfunction symptoms. 5 children had vesicoureteral reflux on voiding
cystography and 10 patients had established scars on DMSA scan at initial
presentation. Urodynamic study showed constriction of the urinary sphincter
during voiding and increase of post-voiding residual urine volume in all
children, with bladder instability 20 (80%). Treatment consisted of voiding
reeducation, anticholinergics, antibiotic prophylaxis and muscle relaxants. The
mean of follow-up was 22 months. Clinical remission occurred prior to urodynamic 
remission in all girls. Clinical recurrence was observed in 2 girls after
cessation of treatment prior to normalization of urodynamic pattern.
Non-coordinated voiding should be diagnosed and treated at pediatric age to avoid
its possible progression to renal failure in other period of life.

Non-131I-scintigraphy in the treatment and follow-up of thyroid cancer.
Single-photon-emitters or FDG-PET?

Grünwald F(1), Briele B, Biersack HJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Bonn, Germany.

With respect to further therapeutic options, whole-body 131I scintigraphy (WBS)
is the most important functional imaging technique during treatment and follow-up
of differentiated thyroid cancer. But in many patients, thyroid cancer tissue
does not concentrate 131I and can therefore not be localized using WBS. In
addition to morphologic techniques, which have a low specificity in many cases,
other methods are necessary to localize tumor tissue in these patients. Besides
201Tl, which has been used initially as a tumor-seeking agent, sestamibi,
tetrofosmin and 18F-DG for PET imaging have been evaluated in differentiated
thyroid carcinoma. This paper summarizes the clinical impact of functional
imaging with tracers besides 131I. In direct comparison, 18F-DG-PET has the
highest sensitivity, which exceeds 80% in cases with negative WBS. If available, 
this method should be considered in all patients suffering from differentiated
thyroid cancer with suspected recurrence and/or metastases, particularly in cases
with elevated thyroglobulin values and negative WBS. But also 99mTc-labeled
tracers can be used to detect tumor tissue with a sufficient sensitivity. In
medullary thyroid cancer, which presents frequently with diagnostic difficulties,
111In-octreotide, 99mTc-(V)-DMSA, 131I/123I-mIBG, and anti-CEA can be used, in
addition.

The presence of lead decreases the availability of meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid for analysis in the monobromobimane assay.

meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid is a suitable chelating agent for routine
pharmacotherapy of lead poisoning in children. Administration of
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid presumably permits complexation of lead in vivo,
allowing excretion through urine or feces. Quantification of the lead is achieved
independently from the analysis of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and
metabolites from the monobromobimane assay. To date, no direct chemical
characterization of the Pb species excreted in urine has been successful.
Pharmacokinetic correlation of lead excretion with excretion of
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and metabolites has been utilized as an indirect
method to draw conclusions regarding the identity of the active chelating agent. 
In this study, we hypothesized that the Pb-coordinated thiols are not reactive
with respect to monobromobimane, and thus, the active chelator contained in the
lead complex escapes detection. We performed variations of the assay and found
that (1) the fluorescence detector response for the meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid-monobromobimane adduct was clearly attenuated as a function of added Pb, (2)
when meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and monobromobimane were mixed prior to
the addition of lead, the lead had no effect on detector response, (3) the
addition of dithiothreitol does not affect the ability of Pb to react with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and verifies that oxidation of meso-DMSA had not
occurred, and (4) the addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to the assay
reverses the result found in point 1, presumably through trans chelation of the
Pb-DMSA complex. Indirect quantification of the Pb-DMSA complexes found in urine 
might be accomplished through modification of the standard monobromobimane assay 
for analysis of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Arsenic-induced oxidative stress and its reversibility following combined
administration of N-acetylcysteine and meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in rats.

Establishment, Gwalior, India.

1. The present study examined whether arsenic induces oxidative stress in liver, 
brain and erythrocytes (RBC) based on the investigation of certain selected
parameters. It also explored the possibility that combined administration of
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was capable of
achieving better reversibility in the parameters indicative of arsenic-induced
oxidative stress than individual treatment with either of these drugs. 2. Male
rats were exposed to 100 p.p.m. sodium arsenite in their drinking water for 12
weeks (equivalent to 12 mg/kg As). The arsenic was then removed and rats were
given NAC (1 mmol/kg per day), DMSA (1 mmol/kg per day) or a combination of the
two, orally, once daily for 5 days. Animals not given arsenic and those given
arsenic but not NAC or DMSA served as negative and positive controls,
respectively. 3. Twelve weeks of arsenic exposure was found to deplete
glutathione (GSH) levels, increase oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and promote
malondialdehyde (MDA) production in both liver and brain samples. In addition to 
a significant reduction in RBC delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD)
activity and GSH levels, a marked elevation in MDA production may also contribute
to arsenic-induced oxidative stress. 4. Treatment with either NAC or DMSA alone
partially reversed arsenic-induced alterations in hepatic GSH and MDA, while only
brain MDA levels responded favourably to these drugs. Only DMSA appeared to
restore blood ALAD, while RBC MDA levels responded favourably to both drugs.
Treatment with DMSA also produced an effective depletion of blood and hepatic
arsenic concentrations. In the liver, most of these parameters were more
effectively reversed by combined treatment with NAC and DMSA compared with the
effects of either drug alone. 5. These results provide in vivo evidence of
arsenic-induced oxidative stress in liver, brain and RBC and indicate that these 
effects can be mitigated by pharmacological intervention that encompasses
combined treatment with NAC and DMSA.

of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong, China.

BACKGROUND: Gadolinium-enhanced MRI has recently been employed in the diagnosis
of acute pyelonephritis. Its potential utility in the diagnosis of renal scars in
children is unknown. Objective. To evaluate the potential utility of MRI using
fat-saturated T1-weighted (T1-W) and post-gadolinium, short-tau
inversion-recovery (STIR) sequences in detecting renal scarring by comparison
with technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99 m)Tc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy in
children at risk of renal scarring.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 24 children with spina bifida and neurogenic
bladder or anorectal anomaly was studied. No patient had a history of acute
pyelonephritis. Documented urinary tract infection (UTI) was present in 10
children (42 %). The remaining 14 (58 %) children had a history of asymptomatic
bacteriuria. None had clinical signs or symptoms of acute UTI at the time of the 
study. (99 m)Tc-DMSA and MRI were performed to detect renal scarring. (99
m)Tc-DMSA scans were supplemented with pinhole imaging. MRI of the kidneys
employed a fat-saturated T1-W sequence and a post-gadolinium STIR sequence
employing a short echo time.
RESULTS: Of the kidneys studied, 33 % (n = 16) had evidence of a renal
parenchymal defect suggestive of scarring on (99 m)Tc-DMSA. The concordance in
the detection of a scarred kidney by post-gadolinium STIR sequence and (99
m)Tc-DMSA is 94 %; that by fat-saturated T1-W sequence and (99 m)Tc-DMSA is 82 %;
that by both sequences (positive result on either sequence) and (99 m)Tc-DMSA is 
100 %. Using (99 m)Tc-DMSA as the gold standard, MRI had a sensitivity of 100 %
and a specificity of 78 % in the diagnosis of a scarred kidney. The concordance
in the detection of a scarred zone by post-gadolinium STIR sequence and (99
m)Tc-DMSA is 68 %; that by fat-saturated T1-W sequence and DMSA is 44 %; that by 
both sequences (positive result on either sequence) and (99 m)Tc-DMSA is 84 %.
MRI had a sensitivity of 84 % and a specificity of 86 % in the diagnosis of a
scarred zone, using (99 m)Tc-DMSA as the gold standard.
CONCLUSION: The detection rate for renal scarring on MRI using the fat-saturated 
T1-W and post-gadolinium STIR sequences is comparable to planar (99 m)Tc-DMSA.
MRI is of potential utility in the evaluation of children at risk of renal
scarring.

[Management of ureteroceles with pyelo-ureteral duplication in children. Report
of 64 cases].

[Article in French]

Moscovici J(1), Galinier P, Berrogain N, Juricic M.

Author information: 
(1)Service de Chirurgie Pédiatrique Viscérale, Hôpital des Enfants, Toulouse.

Sixty four cases of ureteroceles in a context of pyeloureteric duplication were
reviewed. They were detected antenatally in 69% of cases. Upper pole
nephroureterectomy was performed as first-line procedure in 32 cases. In 37.5% of
cases, this procedure was followed by lower tract reconstruction, essentially
because of symptomatic reflux in the inferior renal pelvis. Complete renal and
vesical reconstruction was performed as the first-line procedure in 6 cases. An
ureteropelvic anastomosis allowed preservation of the superior renal pelvis in 4 
cases, including one case with secondary lower tract reconstruction. Intravesical
reimplantation of the two ureters was performed in 8 cases. Primary endoscopic
opening of the ureterocele was performed in 10 cases and complementary surgery
was required in 7 cases. Other procedures were used more rarely: temporary
ureterostomy, nephrostomy, resection of the protruding dome of a cecoureterocele.
Current management is usually neonatal. The first step consists of prevention of 
infection. The therapeutic approach depends on the quality of the superior renal 
pelvis assessed by DMSA renal scintigraphy. Immediate complete reconstruction of 
the kidney and bladder is now rarely indicated. When the superior renal pelvis is
not functional, resection should be considered with aspiration of the
ureterocele. A complementary bladder procedure is required in some cases (40% in 
our series) to treat symptomatic reflux in the inferior renal pelvis. When the
superior renal pelvis is functional, ureteropelvic anastomosis is a good
solution, especially when the superior ureter is very large and poorly
functional, but endoscopic opening of the ureterocele can also be proposed, which
may need to be followed be intravesical reconstruction.

Absolute 24 h quantification of 99Tcm-DMSA uptake in patients with severely
reduced kidney function: a comparison with 51Cr-EDTA clearance.

Dierckx RA.

(1)Division of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Gent, Belgium.

The aim of this study was to determine whether absolute 24 h DMSA uptake
measurements (%DMSA) correlate well with 51Cr-EDTA clearance measurements in
patients with severely reduced kidney function (SRKF). Between 1990 and 1997, 55 
of 482 patients who underwent EDTA clearance measurements also underwent %DMSA
within 1 week. Of these, 31 were women and 24 were men (mean age 60 years; range 
19-77 years). EDTA clearance was determined using the slope-intercept method.
Absolute depth- and background-corrected %DMSA were determined 24 h following the
injection of 185 MBq per 1.73 m2 freshly prepared 99Tcm-DMSA. All patients had
EDTA clearance < or = 60 ml.min-1. Eighteen patients (group A: 9 men and 9 women,
mean age 55.8 years, range 28-73 years) had EDTA clearance > 20 ml.min-1 (mean
+/- S.D. = 30.9 +/- 13.8 ml.min-1), whereas 37 patients (group B: 22 women and 15
men, mean age 62.0 years, range 19-77 years) had EDTA clearance < 20 ml.min-1
(mean +/- S.D. = 10.2 +/- 6.6 ml.min-1). EDTA clearance correlated well with
%DMSA for the patients as a whole and for group A (r = 0.87, P = 0.73; r = 0.79, 
P = 0.0001 respectively). The regression equation suggests that %DMSA is not a
marker of early renal dysfunction. In group B, the r-value (r = 0.48, P = 0.004) 
suggests that %DMSA is reliable as a marker of severe renal dysfunction to the
extent that it provides rough information. In conclusion, %DMSA may not be used
as a marker of early renal impairment. Additionally, in patients with severely
reduced kidney function (EDTA clearance < 20 ml.min-1), it only provides a rough 
estimate.

Vicinal-thiol-containing molecules enhance but mono-thiol-containing molecules
reduce nickel-induced DNA strand breaks.

Lynn S(1), Yu GL, Yan K.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Zoology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, 11529, Republic of
China.

Several thiol-containing molecules (TCM) are currently used as antidotes for
nickel, and vicinal TCM seem to be more effective in mobilizing tissue nickel
than are mono TCM. Using single cell alkaline electrophoresis, we have shown that
the vicinal TCM, meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),
2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate, and 2,3-dimercaptopropanol markedly enhanced, 
whereas the mono TCM, D-penicillamide, glutathione, beta-mercaptoethanol, and
diethyl dithiocarbomate, reduced nickel chloride (Ni)-induced DNA breaks in a
human leukemia cell line, NB4 cells. Ni or TCM alone did not induce plasmid DNA
breaks in test tubes and neither did Ni plus mono TCM; however, Ni plus vicinal
TCM did. Vicinal TCM did, but mono TCM did not generate H(2)O(2) in solution.
H(2)O(2) alone did not, but H(2)O(2) plus Ni induced plasmid DNA breaks. Although
Ni plus glutathione did not break DNA, Ni plus glutathione plus H(2)O(2) did. The
Ni-DMSA-induced DNA breaks in NB4 cells, as well as in plasmids, were completely 
prevented by d-mannitol or partially prevented by several antioxidants.
Therefore, the DNA breaks induced by Ni plus vicinal TCM seem to be due to the
complex of Ni with TCM in concert with the H(2)O(2) produced by the vicinal TCM. 
The results that DMSA at a concentration as low as 5 microM enhanced the
Ni-induced DNA breaks suggest a further evaluation of the TCM as nickel chelators
is needed.

Characterization of a group of anaerobically induced, fnr-dependent genes of
Salmonella typhimurium.

Wei Y(1), Miller CG.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
Urbana, Illinois 61801, USA.

We have previously reported the isolation of a group of anaerobically regulated, 
fnr-dependent lac fusions in Salmonella typhimurium and have grouped these oxd
genes into classes based on map position. In order to identify these genes, we
have replaced the original Mud-lac fusion in a member of each oxd class with the 
much smaller Mud-cam element, cloned the fusion, and determined DNA sequence
sufficient to define the oxd gene. Several of the fusions correspond to
previously known genes from S. typhimurium or Escherichia coli: oxd-4 = cbiA and 
oxd-11 = cbiK, oxd-5 = hybB, oxd-7 = dcuB, oxd-8 = moaB, oxd-12 = dmsA, and
oxd-14 = napB (aeg-46. 5). Two other fusions correspond to previously unknown
loci: oxd-2 encodes an acetate/propionate kinase, and oxd-6 encodes a putative
ABC transporter present in S. typhimurium but not in E. coli.

The value of Ga-67 renal SPECT in diagnosing and monitoring complete and
incomplete treatment in children with acute pyelonephritis.

Yen TC(1), Tzen KY, Chen WP, Lin CY.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei Medical
Center and School of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taiwan.

PURPOSE: This study evaluated the utility of Ga-67 renal SPECT for diagnosing
acute pyelonephritis (APN) in children and monitoring them.
METHODS: Seventy-one children (ages 1 week to 12 years) who were thought
clinically to have APN were included in the study. The disease was considered
present if the patients had all of the following: fever (38.5 degrees C), pyuria 
(leukocyte counts/per high-power field > or = 10), and a positive result of a
urinary culture or blood culture. Tc-99m DMSA, Ga-67 renal SPECT, and voiding
cystourethrography were performed, with informed consent from the patients'
parents, within 3 days after hospitalization. Three months after treatment,
Tc-99m DMSA and Ga-67 renal SPECT were repeated in those patients who had
abnormal results of the initial Ga-67 renal SPECT.
RESULTS: In the diagnostic study, Ga-67 renal SPECT was superior to DMSA renal
SPECT in detecting lesions (97% vs. 79%). Three children had false-negative
results with Ga-67 renal SPECT. Seventeen kidneys were negative with Tc-99m DMSA 
but positive with Ga-67 renal SPECT. No patients had any Ga-67 uptake on
post-therapy imaging. However, 32 of 107 kidneys (30%) had permanent renal scars.
In these 107 kidneys, 78 (73%) were associated with high-grade vesicoureteral
reflux (VUR; VUR grade > or = 3) and 29 (27%) with low-grade or no VUR.
CONCLUSIONS: High-grade VUR tends to be associated more with APN than has been
reported by others, probably because of an underestimation of APN by
ultrasonography or DMSA. Ga-67 renal SPECT is sensitive and useful not only in
diagnosis but also for monitoring and follow-up of children with clinical
suspicion of APN, especially in those with equivocal results after DMSA renal
SPECT studies.

How sensitive is ultrasound in the detection of renal scars?

Roebuck DJ(1), Howard RG, Metreweli C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Organ Imaging, Chinese University of
Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong.

The English language medical literature was reviewed to determine the strength of
the published evidence for the assertion that dimercaptosuccinic acid
scintigraphy (DMSA) is superior to ultrasound (US) in the detection of
established renal scarring in children. The MEDLINE database was used to identify
papers published between 1985 and 1997 that claimed to be concerned with the
detection of scars, and contained sufficient information to permit calculation of
the sensitivity of US relative to DMSA. Only 10 studies were identified. The
sensitivity of US for scarring, using DMSA as a gold standard, ranged from 37% to
100%, and its specificity from 65% to 99%. These wide ranges mean that evaluation
of the role of US in the detection of scarring remains controversial. All papers 
contained methodological flaws. Allowing for these, the sensitivity of US appears
to be acceptable. Further research that avoids these methodological problems is
required.

A review of ninety-two obstructive megaureters in children.

Vereecken RL(1), Proesmans W.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, KU Leuven, Belgium.

OBJECTIVES: The evolution of clinical presentation, age of surgery and
therapeutic approach of obstructive nonrefluxing megaureters (OMU) in children
throughout the years has been retrospectively evaluated.
METHODS: 78 children with 92 stenotic ureterovesical junctions (UVJ) were
reviewed. 66 underwent surgery at a median age of 20 months, after a median of
10.5 months of conservative treatment with prophylactic antibiotics. 21 OMU were 
diagnosed prenatally, 71 because of symptoms at later age. 15 ureters (12
children) (24% in the prenatal, 14% in the second group) were treated in a
conservative way for 2 years with antibiotics. In the prenatal group 33% needed a
reimplantation with tailoring and 10% without tailoring while in the other group 
the figures are reversed: 39% without and 21% with tailoring. 28% in the prenatal
group and 17% of the second group were reimplanted at a mean of 15 months after a
primary cutaneous ureterostomy. Three of 5 ureteroceles were treated by
endoscopic incision; 4 had an immediate nephroureterectomy. The mean follow-up is
>70 months.
RESULTS: By prenatal diagnosis the number of conservatively treated cases
increased from 14 to 24%. Indications for surgery remained unchanged: recurrent
infection and poor kidney function. Both approaches resulted in stabilization of 
pretreatment renal function; nearly half of the DMSA scans showed a R:L
difference of >20% at follow-up. Ureterostomy for infected deteriorating kidneys 
rapidly ameliorated the function and resulted in shrinking of the ureteral
diameter making tailoring at reimplantation unnecessary. One of the 3
endoscopically incised ureteroceles required later reintervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Male:female (3:1), left:right (2:1) prevalence and high associated
urological (30%) and nonurological (19%) pathology is found. Unsatisfactory
reliability of tests for obstruction diagnosis and a referral bias explains the
larger number of conservatively treated ureters in the prenatal group. Despite
prenatal diagnosis, the age for surgery was not altered since the indications
remained identical. Most OMU can be treated by a simple or tailored
reimplantation of the ureter after resection of the stenotic segment. A temporary
ureterostomy in small children with refractory infections restores function and
avoids the necessity for tailoring at final reconstruction. One of 3
endoscopically incised ureteroceles needed surgery at a later stage. DMSA shows
stable function after reimplantation.

The role of 99mtechnetium dimercapto-succinic acid renal scans in the evaluation 
of occult ectopic ureters in girls with paradoxical incontinence.

Pattaras JG(1), Rushton HG, Majd M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC
20010, USA.

PURPOSE: We describe the use of 99mtechnetium (Tc) dimercapto-succinic acid
(DMSA) renal scintigraphy to document poorly functioning and/or ectopic renal
units associated with occult ectopic ureters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the last 8 years 6 toilet-trained girls were
referred for lifelong continuous urinary dribbling. Initial radiological
evaluation included renal and bladder sonography in 6, excretory urography in 4, 
a mercaptoacetyltriglycine-3 renal scan in 1 and cystovaginoscopy in 2.
Ultimately a 99mTc-DMSA renal scan was performed in all 6 girls before surgical
intervention.
RESULTS: Sonography failed to establish the diagnosis of ureteral ectopia in all 
cases, and revealed a normal solitary kidney in 3, normal kidneys in 1, an
apparently uncomplicated unilateral duplication without hydroureteronephrosis in 
1 and a contralateral uncomplicated duplication in 1. Excretory urography in 4
cases was inconclusive and showed a solitary kidney in 1, ipsilateral duplication
without a normal appearing upper pole collecting system in 1, contralateral
uncomplicated duplication in 1 and normal kidneys in 1. A
mercaptoacetyltriglycine-3 renal scan in another girl with a solitary kidney on
sonography failed to demonstrate a contralateral small ectopic kidney.
Cystovaginoscopy performed in 2 patients by other pediatric urologists was
nondiagnostic. 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy was diagnostic in all 6 cases, and
revealed a small poorly functioning ectopic kidney in 3 and a poorly functioning 
dysplastic upper pole moiety in 3, which were consistent with a diagnosis of
ureteral ectopia. An ectopic ureter was confirmed by cystoscopic and surgical
findings in all girls.
CONCLUSIONS: 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy reliably detects and localizes
hypoplastic ectopic kidneys and poorly functioning upper pole moieties associated
with occult ectopic ureters in girls with continuous urinary leakage.

Adjunctive oral corticosteroids reduce renal scarring: the piglet model of reflux
and acute experimental pyelonephritis.

Pohl HG(1), Rushton HG, Park JS, Chandra R, Majd M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC
20010, USA.

PURPOSE: We investigate the efficacy of antibiotics combined with corticosteroid 
in diminishing post-pyelonephritic renal scarring compared to standard antibiotic
therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bilateral vesicoureteral reflux was surgically created in 
36 piglets (72 kidneys). A week later each bladder was inoculated by percutaneous
injection with a standardized broth culture of Escherichia coli and molten
paraffin. 99mTechnetium dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy was
performed 3 days after introduction of urinary infection to detect the presence
of acute pyelonephritis. Acute pyelonephritic lesions seen on DMSA scans were
graded according to the percentage of renal zone involvement as grade 1--less
than 33%, grade 2--33 to 66% and grade 3--greater than 66% involved. When
pyelonephritis was present, piglets were randomized to receive either standard
antibiotics or antibiotics and 2 mg./kg. prednisolone daily. 99mTechnetium-DMSA
scintigraphy was repeated 2 months after completion of therapy, and the kidneys
were harvested for gross and histopathological examination. Each kidney was
divided into upper, middle and lower zones for correlation of pathological and
imaging findings. Severity of renal scarring was then assessed using
histopathological confirmation of gross anatomical findings as grade 1--less than
1, grade 2-1 to 2 and grade 3-greater than 2 cm.
RESULTS: Acute pyelonephritis was induced in 136 of 216 renal zones. The sites of
renal scarring corresponded anatomically to sites of acute pyelonephritis in all 
but 5 cases. Overall, the prevalence of post-pyelonephritic scarring was 56.6%
(77 of 136) of renal zones. The severity of scarring in both groups correlated
with the severity of the initial pyelonephritic lesion. Of the 31 zones that
formed grade 3 renal scars the distribution of grades 1, 2 and 3 acute
pyelonephritis on the initial DMSA scan was 3, 26 and 71%, respectively. Grade 3 
acute pyelonephritis was more likely to result in severe (grade 3) renal scars in
the control compared to the steroid treated group (59 versus 31%). Overall, acute
pyelonephritis completely resolved in 40% of controls and 51% of steroid treated 
animals. However, only 9% of control animals with grade 3 acute pyelonephritis
demonstrated complete resolution, as opposed to 28% of those receiving steroids.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of renal scarring is greatest after severe acute
pyelonephritis involving greater than 66% of a renal zone. Adjunctive oral
prednisolone appears to be effective in diminishing renal scarring in severely
affected kidneys. In kidneys with mild and moderate acute pyelonephritis
antibiotics alone appear to be equally effective in preventing scarring.

Relative 99mTc-MAG3 renal uptake: reproducibility and accuracy.

Piepsz A(1), Tondeur M, Ham H.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radioisotopes, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Saint-Pierre
Brussels, Belgium.

The aim of this study was to estimate the reproducibility and accuracy of
99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) relative percentage uptake.METHODS:
Reproducibility was evaluated on healthy volunteers who were submitted twice to a
99mTc-MAG3 renographic study, which used different uptake algorithms, different
background corrections and different time intervals. Accuracy was evaluated in a 
group of patients with symmetrical or asymmetrical relative renal function, who
underwent both 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 99mTc-MAG3 studies, using
the DMSA relative percentage uptake as a reference.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The methods that combined the best reproducibility and
accuracy for estimating 99mTc-MAG3 left-to-right uptake ratio were the integral
method, with subrenal or perirenal background correction, and the Patlak-Rutland 
plot. The use of the integral method without background correction introduced a
systematic bias, whereas the slope method resulted in high variability. Therefore
these methods cannot be recommended.

Renal function after tumor enucleation: assessment by quantitative SPECT of
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid uptake by the kidneys.

Groshar D(1), Moskovitz B, Kastin A, Issaq E, Nativ O.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine,
Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of functioning renal mass
removed and the amount of remaining individual renal function after tumor
enucleation.METHODS: Renal functional volume, percentage injected dose (%ID) per 
cubic centimeter of renal tissue and individual renal uptake of 24 operated and
24 contralateral kidneys were studied by two sequential SPECT quantitations of
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake by the kidneys (QDMSA). The first
study was before surgery and the second study was 1 to 6 mo (mean 3.5 mo) after
surgery. Mean tumor size was 3.4 +/- 0.99 cm and all tumors were confined to the 
renal parenchyma (stages pT1 and pT2).
RESULTS: In the operated kidneys, there was a statistically significant decrease 
in renal cortical volume (170 +/- 46 mL after surgery versus 207 +/- 45 mL before
surgery, t = 6.2, P < 0.001) and individual renal uptake (10.3% +/- 3.0% after
surgery versus 13.0% +/- 2.9% before surgery, t = 5.4, P < 0.001). There was no
statistically significant change after surgery compared with before surgery in
the %ID per cubic centimeter of renal tissue of the operated kidneys, and in the 
volume, %ID per cubic centimeter and uptake of the contralateral normal kidneys.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that QDMSA is a noninvasive method able to assess
changes in separate renal function. The limited functioning parenchymal loss
after tumor enucleation had no effect on the opposite kidneys.

[Vesico-ureteral reflux: diagnostic and therapeutic procedures].

The vesico ureteral reflux (VUR) is the most common uropathy associated to
urinary tract infections (UTI). The identification of V.U.R. is very important to
avoid reflux nephropathy and it's complications. To avoid the exposure to
unnecessary and injurious x-rays, the authors propose patient selection based on 
the presence or absence of distal ureteral dilatation and on the time elapsed
between typical or atypical symptoms of u.t.i. and fever. First of all, it is
essential to diagnose pielonephritis. After ultrasound and radionuclide
scintigram with DMSA they select the infants who need cystourethrography. The
infants with V.U.R. undergo antibiotic prophylaxis until spontaneous or surgical 
recovery. The duration of prophylaxis depends on the degree of V.U.R. and the age
of the infant at diagnosis.

A critical evaluation of methods for preparing pentavalent 99Tcm-DMSA.

Leah M(1), Williams ED.

Author information: 
(1)School of Sciences, University of Sunderland, UK.

Pentavalent 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99Tcm-(V)DMSA) has established uses in
the detection and diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma, osteosarcoma,
amyloidosis and many soft tissue tumours, but is not readily available as a
commercial kit. We have evaluated published methods for preparation of
99Tcm-(V)DMSA that are based on the modification of 99Tcm-(III)DMSA commercial
kits. The criteria for assessment were achievement of satisfactory radiochemical 
purity and practical considerations regarding the ease of synthesis.
Quantification of the desired product's activity was achieved via thin-layer
chromatography (silica gel) with an n-butanol:acetic acid:water solvent system.
The developed plates were imaged on a gamma camera and analysed using standard
software. The methods investigated were designated as Birmingham, Cambridge and
Canterbury: the latter two were very similar. With experience, the methods
eventually produced similar radiochemical purities of > 90%. However, the
Birmingham method was found to be more satisfactory in terms of its reliability
and simplicity of synthesis.

Effective dose to children and adolescents from radiopharmaceuticals.

Gadd R(1), Mountford PJ, Oxtoby JW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, North Staffordshire Hospital, Royal Infirmary,
Staffordshire, UK.

Published values of tissue weighting factors for adolescents and children derived
from the life-span study of the atomic bomb survivors have been used to calculate
the effective dose to patients aged 1, 5, 10 and 15 years undergoing a common
paediatric procedure requiring one of the following radiopharmaceuticals:
99Tcm-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3), 99Tcm-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid
(DTPA), 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 99Tcm-pertechnetate,
99Tcm-iminodiacetic acid (IDA) derivatives, 99Tcm-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxine
(HMPAO), 99Tcm-labelled leukocytes, 99Tcm-labelled erythrocytes,
99Tcm-phosphates, 99Tcm-methyloxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI), 201Tl-chloride,
sodium 123I-iodide, 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and 67Ga-citrate.
Administered activities for each age group were based on ARSAC maximum usual
values for adult patients and scaling factors listed by the European Association 
of Nuclear Medicine for different body weights. These effective doses were
compared to values derived from ICRP whole-population tissue weighting factors
and found to differ by -33% to +71% of these values, and by less than +/- 20% for
two-thirds of the procedures. Because these differences were considerably less
than the uncertainties in the estimates of organ absorbed dose, we conclude that 
these published age-specific tissue weighting factors should not be used for the 
estimation of effective dose to children and adolescents following the
administration of radiopharmaceuticals, and that whole-population factors should 
continue to be used for these estimations.

Increased urine interleukin-6 concentrations correlate with pyelonephritic
changes on 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans in neonates with urinary tract
infections.

Interleukin (IL)-6 and -8 are important inflammatory cytokines in bacterial
infections. Their serum and urine concentrations were measured in 27 neonates
with urinary tract infection (UTI) at onset and the second week of therapy, as
well as in 23 control neonates. Escherichia coli was isolated in 89% of cases.
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scans were performed between the 10th 
and 90th days after UTI and showed pyelonephritic changes in 15 neonates (56%).
Increased IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were found in urine but not in serum
within the first 24 h after presumptive diagnosis of UTI (P=.036 and.010,
respectively), suggesting that the neonatal urinary tract can respond to
uropathogens by producing inflammatory cytokines. Urine concentrations of IL-6
correlated with findings of renal changes in 99mTc-DMSA scans (P=.012) and thus
may serve as a marker of renal parenchymal outcome. All neonates exhibited
undetectable urine cytokine levels during the second week of therapy.

Nanomolar levels of dimethylsulfoniopropionate, dimethylsulfonioacetate, and
glycine betaine are sufficient to confer osmoprotection to Escherichia coli.

Rennes, France.

We combined the use of low inoculation titers (300 +/- 100 CFU/ml) and
enumeration of culturable cells to measure the osmoprotective potentialities of
dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), dimethylsulfonioacetate (DMSA), and glycine
betaine (GB) for salt-stressed cultures of Escherichia coli. Dilute bacterial
cultures were grown with osmoprotectant concentrations that encompassed the
nanomolar levels of GB and DMSP found in nature and the millimolar levels of
osmoprotectants used in standard laboratory osmoprotection bioassays. Nanomolar
concentrations of DMSA, DMSP, and GB were sufficient to enhance the salinity
tolerance of E. coli cells expressing only the ProU high-affinity general
osmoporter. In contrast, nanomolar levels of osmoprotectants were ineffective
with a mutant strain (GM50) that expressed only the low-affinity ProP osmoporter.
Transport studies showed that DMSA and DMSP, like GB, were taken up via both ProU
and ProP. Moreover, ProU displayed higher affinities for the three
osmoprotectants than ProP displayed, and ProP, like ProU, displayed much higher
affinities for GB and DMSA than for DMSP. Interestingly, ProP did not operate at 
substrate concentrations of 200 nM or less, whereas ProU operated at
concentrations ranging from 1 nM to millimolar levels. Consequently, proU(+)
strains of E. coli, but not the proP(+) strain GM50, could also scavenge
nanomolar levels of GB, DMSA, and DMSP from oligotrophic seawater. The
physiological and ecological implications of these observations are discussed.

Urinary excretion of tubular proteins and the technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) absolute renal uptake in partial ureteral obstruction in rats: a
functional evaluation of hydronephrotic kidneys.

Voorde J, Dierckx RA, Oosterlinck W.

The aim of this longitudinal study was to evaluate tubular proteinuria in rats
with unilateral (UPO) and bilateral (BPO) partial ureteral obstruction with the
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan as the gold standard for measuring renal
tubular damage. We studied 70 female Wistar rats: 28 animals with UPO, 28 animals
with BPO, 7 sham-operated animals, and 7 controls. All animals with obstructed
ureters showed renal dilatation on the diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid DTPA
images 1 and 5 weeks postoperatively. One week following UPO and BPO, tubular
proteinuria and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity increased 
(P < 0.01) and the absolute DMSA uptake decreased (P < 0.01). Persistently (week 
6) high tubular proteinuria was found in 29% of the animals and was related to
severe damage on the DMSA scan (P < 0.01) and to albuminuria (P < 0.05). Renal
tubular damage was demonstrated by measuring renal enzymes, tubular proteins, and
DMSA uptake after UPO and BPO. Persistent elevated tubular proteinuria was
related to severely damaged kidneys.

Lead inhibits meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid induced calcium transients in
cultured rhesus monkey kidney cells.

Pokorski PL(1), McCabe MJ Jr, Pounds JG.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Chemical Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wayne
State University, Detroit, MI 48201-2654, USA.

Previously we have shown that meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, 15-500
microM) elicits concentration-dependent increases in intracellular calcium levels
([Ca2+]i) in untreated rhesus monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK2) (Pokorski et al.,
1997, unpublished results). Little is known about the restorative effects of the 
chelating agent 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid on intracellular calcium homeostasis 
in the presence of lead. Lead interacts at numerous sites in Ca2+ homeostasis and
may mimic Ca2+ to interfere with Ca2+-mediated intracellular signaling. To
examine the effects of lead on [Ca2+]i and DMSA-induced calcium transients,
LLC-MK2 were plated on 35 mm coverslip dishes (10(4) cells/dish) and pre-treated 
with non-cytotoxic concentrations of lead (0-100 microM) for 24 h. Cells were
washed, loaded with the calcium-sensitive probe Fura-2/AM, rinsed again, and
examined in loading buffer in the absence of any additional lead. Intracellular
calcium was measured using a dual-wavelength calcium imaging system. Basal
[Ca2+]i levels did not change between Pb-exposed (0-50 microM, 24 h) and non-lead
exposed cells. In cells treated with > or = 10 microM lead for 24 h, the ability 
of DMSA to elicit a calcium response was blocked. These results provide evidence 
that pre-exposure to lead blocks the entry of extracellular calcium into LLC-MK2 
cells when stimulated by specific calcium mobilizing agents.

Quantitative SPECT of 99mTc-DMSA uptake in kidneys of infants with unilateral
ureteropelvic junction obstruction: assessment of structural and functional
abnormalities.

Groshar D(1), Wald M, Moskovitz B, Issaq E, Nativ O.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine,
Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa.

We evaluated individual renal function using quantitative SPECT of
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake by the kidneys (QDMSA) in infants with
unilateral ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction and compared our findings
with infants without obstruction.METHODS: QDMSA was performed on 13 infants (mean
age of 2.8 +/- 2.8 mo) with unilateral UPJ obstruction and on 15 age-matched
controls without obstruction.
RESULTS: Control kidneys (n = 30) had a volume of 43.5 +/- 8.8 mL, a percentage
injected dose (%ID)/mL 0.62 +/- 0.12 and uptake of 26.1% +/- 3.9%. Kidneys with
UPJ obstruction (n = 13) had a volume of 61.2 +/- 19.3 mL, a %ID/mL of 0.42 +/-
0.11 and uptake of 25.4% +/- 8.2%. Contralateral kidneys (n = 13) had a volume of
44.0 +/- 11.9 mL, a %ID/mL of 0.57 +/- 0.16 and uptake of 24.2% +/- 4.6%. The
uptake in obstructed kidneys was similar to that observed in contralateral and
control kidneys (t = -0.77, P = 0.45; t = -0.37, P = 0.71; respectively). UPJ
kidneys had a statistically significant increased volume and decreased %ID/mL,
compared with contralateral kidneys (t = 3.35, P < 0.006 and t = 3.75, P < 0.003,
respectively) and control kidneys (t = -4.2, P < 0.001 and t = 4.7, P < 0.001,
respectively). There was no significant difference between contralateral kidneys 
and control kidneys regarding volume (t = -0.16, P = 0.87), %ID/mL (t = 0.98, P =
0.33) and uptake (t = -1.41, P = 0.16). Of 13 infants, 11 (85%) showed large
kidneys with thinning of the renal cortex. In 1 infant, there was no difference
between the obstructed and contralateral kidneys regarding volume, %ID/mL and
uptake, and 1 infant showed significant decreased uptake in the UPJ kidney
compared with the contralateral kidney.
CONCLUSION: Although the overall renal function of the obstructed kidneys
remained unchanged, there was a statistically significant decrease in the %ID/mL 
of renal tissue in UPJ kidneys, which may represent renal dysfunction. Increased 
functional volume with a thin cortex may represent a compensatory mechanism of
the obstructed kidney. Such changes may contribute to the understanding of
pathophysiologic mechanisms and may be an early sign of obstruction in infants
with hydronephrosis. Further longitudinal studies with an extended number of
infants and serial measurements of kidney volumes and %ID/mL are warranted to
assess the significance of QDMSA in the management of infants with asymptomatic
unilateral renal pelvic dilatation.

Polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been shown to affect
renal prognosis in a number of diseases. We examined the influence of deletion
(D) and insertion (I) polymorphism in the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)
gene and the other polymorphic markers of RAS, and that of plasminogen-activator 
inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) on renal scarring in reflux nephropathy. Ninety-four children
with third- or fourth-degree reflux were the subject of the study. They were
stratified into two groups according to the technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) findings: the first group consisted of 41 patients with no scar
formation. In the second group (n = 53), there was significant scar formation in 
the refluxing units. ACE levels, ACE gene, angiotensin-1 receptor (AT1) A1166C,
angiotensinogen (ATG) M235T, and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms were studied. In the
second group with scarred kidneys, 18 patients had decreased renal function. The 
frequency of patients homozygous for the D allele was significantly greater in
the second group with scar formation in the refluxing units compared with the
first group of patients (P < 0.005). On multivariate analysis, the DD genotype
was the only factor that had a significant impact on renal scar formation,
introducing a 4.9-fold risk (P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval). We were unable
to find any correlation with the presence ofDD genotype and hypertension,
decreased renal function, proteinuria, or sex of the patient. DDgenotype
correlated with the serum ACE levels (P < 0.005). AT1and ATGpolymorphisms and
PAI-1 polymorphism did not correlate with scar formation or any of the
parameters. This study provides evidence that the DDgenotype of ACE may be a
genetic susceptibility factor contributing to adverse renal prognosis in reflux
nephropathy; namely, scar formation. The role of the synergism between the
aforementioned genetic polymorphisms can be enlightened with larger patient
groups, possibly through multicenter studies.

Separation of renal fragments by a urinoma after renal trauma: percutaneous
drainage accelerates healing.

Wilkinson AG(1), Haddock G, Carachi R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Yorkhill, Glasgow, 
UK.

BACKGROUND: Two boys suffered blunt abdominal trauma resulting in renal injury.
In both cases the damaged kidney was fractured through its mid-portion, and the
upper and lower fragments of the kidney became widely separated by a urinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: US-guided drainage of the urinoma resulted in immediate
apposition of the renal fragments. The drains were left on free drainage by
gravity for 1 week before removal.
RESULTS: The urinomas did not reaccumulate and follow-up DMSA scans showed good
residual function.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that drainage of urinomas that separate renal fragments
should be considered since this may accelerate healing and help preserve renal
function.

Complex regulation of Ly-6E gene transcription in T cells by IFNs.

Khodadoust MM(1), Khan KD, Bothwell AL.

Author information: 
(1)Section of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT
06520, USA.

The complexity of IFN-mediated regulation of the murine Ly-6E gene in T cell
lines is highlighted by the following observations: 1) multiple regulatory
regions are present within different parts of the Ly-6E promoter and are
necessary for IFN inducibility of the Ly-6E gene, 2) multiple transcription
factors including Oct-1 and Oct-2 and the high mobility group (HMG) protein
HMGI(Y) bind to regulatory elements present within the G region required for both
IFN-alphabeta and IFN-gamma responses, 3) mutational analysis of the G region
reveals that a complex interaction exists between the factors binding to this
region as shown by their mutual interdependence for detection in DMSA, and 4)
inhibition of expression of HMG proteins by antisense HMGI-C RNA in EL4 cells
causes the loss of IFN-alphabeta and IFN-gamma inducibility of the endogenous
Ly-6 gene. These findings taken together suggest that, in response to IFN
treatment, an HMG protein-dependent complex involving multiple regulatory factors
is assembled and is required for IFN inducibility of the Ly-6E gene.

Rational diagnostic steps in acute pyelonephritis with special reference to
ultrasonography and computed tomography scan.

Depending on the severity of the clinical syndrome, acute pyelonephritis may
require more extensive imaging diagnostics. In the uncomplicated form of the
disease, ultrasonography does not appear to be absolutely necessary. In
clinically severe cases, however, which fail to respond to antibiotic therapy,
ultrasound is the optimal procedure for ruling out urinary tract obstruction.
Where there is clinical suspicion of complications proven risk factors,
persistent fever and/or continuing pathological inflammation parameters (elevated
C-reactive protein levels in serum)-ultrasonography is the primary imaging
technique for the exclusion of pyonephrosis, as well as for other complicating
factors such as calculi, etc. In cases of insufficient response to antibiotic
therapy, we recommend performing a renal computed tomography scan with contrast
medium, in order to rule out hypoenhancing zones as hints for severe tissue
alterations. This procedure is in accordance with the suggestions of the Society 
for Uroradiology. In the future, DMSA scintigraphy might constitute an equivalent
diagnostic method for the exclusion of these focal inflammatory changes. Above
all, DMSA scintigraphy makes it possible to anticipate the development of scars
following acute pyelonephritis.

[Long-term follow-up of a bladder exstrophy case after successful repair].

[Article in Japanese]

Senoh K(1), Yamaguchi T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Fukuoka City Medical Center for Sick Children and
Infectious Diseases.

We present a female case of bladder exstrophy where the patient was followed up
for 15 years. In 1982 primary closure of the bladder and urethra with bilateral
iliotomy by the posterior approach was performed at the age of 4 months. However,
realignment was necessary, since the wound split open postoperatively. We used a 
corset specially prepared for this patient to prevent wound dehiscence during the
subsequent postoperative course. Four years later, VUR was surgically eradicated.
At the age of 9 years old, her bladder function was satisfactory, demonstrating a
normal CM pattern with synergia and Pmax 128 cm H2O on UPP. She had no urge or
stress incontinence. The most recent IVP and DMSA renal scan revealed almost
normal findings. VCUG showed no VUR and renal function tests (PSP, Ccr 24) also
confirmed no interval deterioration. We believe that the approximation of the
intersymphyseal band at the time of bladder neck closure is the single most
important factor for ensuring urinary continence.

Rapid renal single-photon emission tomography by continuous infusion of
iridium-191m.

Treves ST(1), Fung L, Packard AB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston,
MA 02115, USA.

Continuous infusion of iridium-191m (t1/2 = 5 s), produced with an 191Os/191mIr
generator, was used to obtain rapid high-resolution single-photon emission
tomography (SPET) of renal blood flow in the rabbit. SPET scans of the abdomen
were obtained with a triple-detector SPET system (MS3, Siemens Gammasonics). The 
generator was eluted at a flow rate of 3 ml/min, which delivered a steady-state
dose of 170 MBq (4.5 mCi) of 191mIr. The total 191Os breakthrough was 850 kBq (23
microCi). A 5-min SPET acquisition recorded a total of 2.8 million counts,
resulting in images of high technical quality. Volume-rendered images clearly
showed the abdominal aorta, splenic artery, spleen, renal arteries, kidneys and
splanchnic vasculature. Tomographic slices through the kidneys revealed tracer
primarily within the renal cortices without visualization of the collecting
system. The estimated effective dose equivalent for a 5 min infusion of 191mIr at
a steady-state dose of 170 MBq is 0.74 mSv compared with 2.7 mSv from a 170 MBq
dose of 99mTc-DMSA. This study demonstrates the feasibility of high-resolution
SPET of regional renal perfusion in the rabbit by continuous intravenous infusion
of 191mIr. The renal distribution of continuously infused 191mIr is largely
within the cortices, with minimal or no detectable activity in the region of the 
renal pelvicalyceal system. Using this technique, cortical renal SPET can be
completed much more rapidly (< 5 min) than with conventional renal cortical
imaging agents, which suggests that this technique could be applied to the
observation of rapid changes in renal perfusion such as those resulting from
pharmacologic intervention, obviating the need for the patient to return for
additional visits. Additional studies are required to (a) validate the
methodology in larger animals prior to considering the potential for use in human
beings, (b) optimize the generator design for continuous infusion, and (c)
evaluate the changes in the distribution of 191mIr that occur in animal models of
altered renal perfusion.

Normal appearances of technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid in children on
planar imaging.

Pusuwan P(1), Reyes L, Gordon I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, 
London, UK.

Thirty-two children who underwent renal arteriography with normal results also
underwent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) imaging. Variations in
the normal appearance of 99mTc-DMSA images are described in these children.
Criteria for high-quality 99mTc DMSA images are defined in terms of kidney
outline and contrast between the inner and the outer part of the kidney. Most of 
the images in this study were of high quality. The two most common features of
normal 99mTc-DMSA images were a round-shaped (50%) or flat (either lateral or
medial aspect) (24.8%) contour. A small number of unusual appearances were
observed and these have been illustrated. The mean differential function of the
left kidney was 51% with a range of 45%-57%.

Children with moderately elevated lead levels: is chelation with DMSA helpful?

O'Connor ME(1), Rich D.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio,
USA.

This study evaluates the effectiveness (use under routine circumstances) of DMSA 
(2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid) and environmental remediation as compared with
placebo and environmental remediation on children with blood lead (BPb) levels of
30-45 micrograms/dL (1.45-2.17 mumol/L). The endpoints were BPb at 1 month and 6 
months after study entry. This double-blind placebo-controlled trial involved 39 
children aged 2-5 years, who were randomized to one course of DMSA or placebo.
The mean BPb levels of the two groups at study entry were similar, placebo group 
33.0 micrograms/dL (1.59 mumol/L) and the DMSA group 34.9 micrograms/dL (1.68
mumol/L). At 1 month (the end of treatment) the mean BPb levels of the two groups
were: placebo group 33.2 micrograms/dL (1.60 mumol/L) and the DMSA group 27.4
micrograms/dL (1.32 mumol/L), p = 0.16. At 6 months, the mean BPb levels were
25.1 micrograms/dL (1.21 mumol/L) for the placebo group and 28.8 micrograms/dL
(1.39 mumol/L) for the DMSA-treated group, p = 0.06. Neither of these differences
is statistically significant. All children with BPb, in the range studied here,
should receive environmental evaluation and remediation; DMSA does not improve
long-term blood lead levels.

Preparation of [186Re]Re-DMSA and its bio-distribution studies.

Author information: 
(1)Isotope Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India.

99mTc(V)-DMSA is widely used for imaging medullary carcinoma and hence
186/188Re(V)-DMSA is suggested as a potential agent for treating medullary
carcinoma. In the present paper, we report the work carried out for the
preparation of [186Re]Re(V)-DMSA and it's bio-distribution studies in Wistar
rats. The complex was prepared by reducing 186Re (100 micrograms, 0.54 microM,
approximately 150 MBq) in the presence of DMSA (2 mg, 11 microM) with stannous
chloride (0.4 mg, 2.2 microM) in acidic medium at pH 2. The reaction was taken to
completion by heating the complex in a boiling water bath for 30 min.
Bio-distribution studies carried out revealed that pharmacological behaviour of
186Re(V)-DMSA is similar to that of 99mTc(V)-DMSA except that the kidney uptake
is marginally higher. The kidney uptake reduced significantly when the pH of the 
complex was adjusted to 8 prior to injection. The in vitro stability studies of
this complex suggest that the product formed is stable and could be used for
clinical trials.

Combined chelation therapy in reducing tissue lead concentrations in suckling
rats.

Health, Zagreb, Republic of Croatia.

The very young are more prone to lead poisoning than adults, and the treatment
with chelating agents, either as monotherapy or combined treatment, is still a
matter of dispute. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of
three chelating agents administered either as monotherapies or as combined
treatments in sucklings. Lead acetate (5 mg Pb kg(-1) i.p.) was administered to
the 7-day-old rat pups in eight litters on experimental day 1 and chelating
agents on experimental days 2 and 3. Pups were divided into six groups: (1)
untreated control; (2) EDTA (calcium disodium ethylendiaminetetraacetate, 0.3
mmol kg(-1) i.p. at 4 p.m.); (3) meso-DMSA (meso-2,3-dimeracaptosuccinic acid,
0.5 mmol kg(-1) p.o. at 10 a.m.); (4) rac-DMSA (racemic-2,3-dimeracaptosuccinic
acid, 0.5 mmol kg(-1) p.o. at 10 a.m.); (5) EDTA+meso-DMSA; and (6)
EDTA+rac-DMSA. Rats were killed on experimental day 5. Tissue element
concentrations were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Treatment with
EDTA did not affect tissue Pb, but it reduced Zn in the carcass and liver.
Meso-DMSA reduced Pb in the kidneys and brain, and it did not affect organ
essential elements. Rac-DMSA most efficiently reduced Pb concentrations in the
carcass, kidneys and brain, but it also reduced Zn and Cu in the liver and Zn in 
the kidneys. Combined treatments with EDTA never improved the efficiency of
either DMSA isoform in decreasing tissue Pb but they did reduce tissue Zn
concentrations. All treatments caused the same decrease in the carcass Ca
concentrations. The results do not support combined treatment in this age group, 
which is especially sensitive to trace element deficiencies, and suggest that
meso-DMSA might be the treatment of choice in acute lead poisoning in infants.

Comparison of ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy changes in
acute pyelonephritis.

Dumas R.

The strategy for morphological investigations in children with acute
pyelonephritis (APN) remains debatable. We studied 70 children (median age 2.0
years) admitted with a first episode of pyelonephritis using a high-resolution
ultrasound technique (RUS) and compared the results with 99m
technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy. The DMSA scan was
abnormal in 62 children (89%). However, using a high-frequency transducer we
found abnormal sonogram changes in 61 children (87%), consisting of an increased 
kidney volume in 42, and/or a thickening of the wall of the renal pelvis in 42,
and/or a focal hyper- or hypoechogenicity in 36, and/or a diffuse
hyperechogenicity in 31 children. Micturating cystourethrography was performed in
all children, revealing vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in 22 (31%). Among those
children with VUR, 4 had a normal DMSA scan, 2 an abnormal RUS, and 2 a normal
DMSA scan and RUS. Our data suggest that B-mode RUS performed with a
high-frequency transducer by a trained radiologist is nearly as sensitive as the 
DMSA scan in diagnosing renal involvement in children with unobstructed APN and
in predicting VUR.

Improved renal cortical SPECT of neonates and young infants using narrow imaging 
pallets.

Cooper JA(1), McCandless BK.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Albany Medical Center, New York, USA.

OBJECTIVE: The widths of most commercially-made imaging pallets limit the
resolution of 99mTc DMSA SPECT imaging in neonates and young infants. We
constructed a pediatric imaging pallet for 99mTc DMSA SPECT of neonates and young
infants designed to allow close apposition of the camera to these patients during
the entire orbit.
METHODS: We designed the imaging pallet to replace the standard removable pallet 
on the imaging stand of a commercial gamma camera. The device consisted of two
parts: a steel bracket attached to the imaging stand and a polyvinyl chloride
imaging pallet. The imaging pallet consisted of interchangeable 15.24-cm (6-in)
or 20.32-cm (8-in) diameter, 6.35-mm (1/4-in) thick polyvinyl chloride plumbing
pipes cut in half lengthwise.
RESULTS: The pallets were mechanically stable with loads 3 times that expected in
clinical practice. Attenuation was acceptable and comparable to commercial
pallets. The hemicylindrical shape provided side support and reduced patient
motion, as well as allowing closer apposition of the camera head to the patient. 
The quality of these 99mTc DMSA SPECT images compared favorably with those
obtainable in older children and adults. Specifically, the renal cortices were
well delineated from the collecting systems and anatomic detail of normal cortex 
could be readily distinguished from abnormal cortex.
CONCLUSION: Custom pediatric imaging pallets optimized for use in neonates and
small children can be constructed inexpensively. These pallets are easy to use
and are stable. Use of these pallets can optimize 99mTc DMSA SPECT images of
neonates and young infants.

Predictors of dimercaptosuccinic acid chelatable lead and tibial lead in former
organolead manufacturing workers.

Schwartz BS(1), Stewart WF, Todd AC, Links JM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene
and Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To identify predictors of tibial and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
chelatable lead in 543 organolead manufacturing workers with past exposure to
organic and inorganic lead.
METHODS: In this cross sectional study, tibial lead (by 109Cd K-shell x ray
fluorescence), DMSA chelatable lead (4 hour urinary lead excretion after oral
administration of 10 mg/kg), and several exposure measures were obtained on study
participants, mean (SD) age 57.6 (7.6) years.
RESULTS: Tibial lead concentrations ranged from -1.6 to 52.0 micrograms lead/g
bone mineral, with a mean (SD) of 14.4 (9.3) micrograms/g. DMSA chelatable lead
ranged from 1.2 to 136 micrograms, with a mean (SD) of 19.3 (17.2) micrograms. In
a multiple linear regression model of tibial lead, age (p < 0.01), duration of
exposure (p < 0.01), current (p < 0.01) and past (p = 0.05) cigarette smoking,
and diabetes (p = 0.01) were all independent positive predictors, whereas height 
(p = 0.03), and exercise inducing sweating (p = 0.04) were both negative
predictors. The final regression model accounted for 31% of the variance in
tibial lead concentrations; 27% was explained by age and duration of exposure
alone. DMSA chelatable lead was directly associated with tibial lead (p = 0.01), 
cumulative exposure to inorganic lead (y.microgram/m3, p = 0.01), current smoking
(p < 0.01), and weight (p < 0.01), and negatively associated with diabetes (p =
0.02). The final model accounted for 11% of the variance in chelatable lead. When
blood lead was added to this model of DMSA chelatable lead, tibial lead,
cumulative exposure to inorganic lead, and diabetes were no longer significant;
blood lead accounted for the largest proportion of variance (p < 0.001); and the 
total model r2 increased to 19%.
CONCLUSIONS: The low proportions of variance explained in models of both tibial
and chelatable lead suggest that other factors are involved in the deposition of 
lead in bone and soft tissue. In epidemiological studies of the health effects of
lead, evaluation of associations with both these measures may allow inferences to
be made about whether health effects are likely to be recent, and thus
potentially reversible, or chronic, and thus possibly irreversible. The data also
provide direct evidence that in men the total amount of lead in the body that is 
bioavailable declines with age.

Neurobehavioral function and tibial and chelatable lead levels in 543 former
organolead workers.

Stewart WF(1), Schwartz BS, Simon D, Bolla KI, Todd AC, Links J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health,
Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations between tibial lead, dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA)-chelatable lead, and neurobehavioral function in former organolead
manufacturing workers with past exposure to organic and inorganic lead.
METHODS: Data were collected from 543 subjects with a mean age of 58 years and an
average of 17.8 years since last lead exposure. Years since last exposure to lead
was used to estimate tibial lead levels in the year of last occupational lead
exposure, termed "peak tibial lead." Current tibial lead levels, measured by
x-ray fluorescence, were extrapolated back using a clearance half-time of lead in
tibia of 27 years, assuming first-order clearance from tibia.
RESULTS: Peak tibial lead levels ranged from -2.2 to 105.9 microg Pb/g bone
mineral, and DMSA-chelatable lead levels were between 1.2 and 136 microg. After
adjustment for confounding variables, peak tibial lead was a significant negative
predictor of performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised
vocabulary subtest (p = 0.02), serial digit learning test (p = 0.04), Rey
Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (immediate recall and recognition, p = 0.03 for
each), Trail Making Test B (p = 0.03), finger tapping (dominant hand [p = 0.02]
and nondominant hand [p < 0.01]), Purdue pegboard (dominant hand, nondominant
hand, both hands, and assembly, p < 0.01 for each), and Stroop Test (p < 0.01).
Moreover, with one exception, average neurobehavioral test scores were poorer at 
higher peak tibial lead levels. DMSA-chelatable lead was only significantly
associated with choice reaction time (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Peak tibial lead was consistently associated with poorer
neurobehavioral test scores, particularly in the domains of manual dexterity,
executive ability, verbal intelligence, and verbal memory.

Chelated lead in relation to lead in bone and ALAD genotype.

Author information:

Lund, SE-221 85, Sweden.

In order to assess whether lead in bone is available for chelation by 2,3
meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 21 workers (10 active and 11 retired) from a
secondary lead smeltery were studied. A morning urine sample was obtained from
all participants, followed by ingestion of 10 mg per kg body weight of the
chelating agent DMSA. All urine produced during the following 24 h was collected 
in consecutive 6- and 18-h portions. Concentrations of lead in blood (B-Pb) and
urine were determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), in
plasma (P-Pb) by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and in
finger bone (Bone-Pb) by K X-ray fluorescence technique (XRF). DMSA-chelatable
lead excreted in the 24-h portion correlated well with the excretion in the 6-h
portion (U-Pb6h; rs=0.95; P<0.001). U-Pb6h showed a non-linear relationship to
B-Pb (rs=0.84; P<0.001) and linear relationships to P-Pb (rs=0. 91; P<0.001) and 
lead in morning urine (rs=0.95; P<0.001). In active workers, but not in retired
ones, P-Pb and U-Pb6h showed some relationship to Bone-Pb. In alternative
multiple regression models B-Pb or P-Pb were both significant predictors of
U-Pb6h, while Bone-Pb did not significantly improve the models. It can, thus, be 
concluded that DMSA-chelatable lead mainly reflects lead concentrations in blood,
soft tissues, and possibly also trabecular bone. It is not a good index of total 
body burden and long-term exposure. For such estimations cortical Bone-Pb is more
valid, as it contains the major fraction of long-term accumulated lead in the
body. Further, the mobilization test did not give better information than
measurements of lead levels in blood, plasma, or urine without chelation.

Consensus on renal cortical scintigraphy in children with urinary tract
infection. Scientific Committee of Radionuclides in Nephrourology.

Rossleigh MA, Sixt R.

A questionnaire related to cortical scintigraphy in children with urinary tract
infection was submitted to 30 experts. A wide consensus was reached on several
issues related to planar images: 99mTc dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA) appears as
the most appropriate tracer for renal imaging; dynamic tracers are considered to 
be inferior, in particular 99mTc diethylenetriaminepentaacetate, which is not
recommended. The general opinion is that DMSA scintigraphy is not feasible with a
minimal dose below 15 MBq, whereas the maximum dose should not be higher than 110
MBq. The dose schedule generally is based on body surface area, and sedation is
only exceptionally given to children. Images are obtained 2 to 3 hours after
injection, preferably with high resolution collimators; pinhole images are used
by only half of the experts. Posterior and posterior oblique views are used by
most of the experts, and the posterior view is acquired in supine positions. At
least 200.000 kcounts or 5 minute acquisition is required for nonzoomed images.
As a quality control, experts check the presence of blurred or double outlines on
the DMSA images. Color images are not used and experts report on film or directly
on the computer screen. As far as normal DMSA images are concerned, most experts 
agree on several normal variants. Hydronephrosis is not a contraindication for
DMSA scintigraphy but constitutes a pitfall. Differential renal function
generally is measured, but no consensus is reached whether or not background
should be subtracted. Most of the experts consider 45% as the lowest normal
value. A consensus is reached on some scintigraphic aspects that are likely to
improve and on some others that probably represent persistent sequelae. There is 
a wide consensus for the systematic use of DMSA scintigraphy for detection of
renal sequelae, whereas only 58% of the experts are systematically performing
this examination during the acute phase of infection.

Determination of medullary thyroid carcinoma metastases by 201Tl, 99Tcm(V)DMSA,

Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MCT) is malignancy derived from the
parafollicular cells (or C-cells) of the thyroid. It is usually sporadic,
although it is familial in some cases. Several scintigraphic procedures can
provide information regarding the primary and metastatic foci of the tumour. We
performed whole-body scanning to establish the pathology of MCT using 201Tl,
99Tcm(V)DMSA and 99Tcm-MIBI in 14 patients, and found average sensitivities of
73%, 82% and 81%, respectively. Moreover, we also scanned three patients with
99Tcm-tetrofosmin and identified two of four pathological foci as well as
residual thyroid tissue. The sensitivities of 201Tl, 99Tcm(V)DMSA and 99Tcm-MIBI 
were 100%, 100% and 85% in identifying lymphadenopathies; 40%, 50% and 71% for
soft tissue foci; 100% and 100% for foci in pulmonary parenchyma; and 100%, 66%
and 100% for recurrences in thyroid gland. Although 99Tcm(V)DMSA identified all
bony metastases in three patients (100%), 99Tcm-MIBI detected only two of three
foci (66%) and 201Tl none. 201Tl, 99Tcm-MIBI and 99Tcm-tetrofosmin accumulated in
residual thyroid tissue, but 99Tcm(V)DMSA did not, as expected. We conclude that 
these agents were complementary, since they had different sensitivities in
different tissues. The tumour-seeking properties of tetrofosmin are to be
evaluated in a larger series.

A variety of software is used to determine quantitative parameters from
radionuclide imaging procedures. Knowledge of the variability of parameter values
found in different hospitals is an important aspect of clinical audit of these
techniques. This study investigated the variation in relative renal function
measurement from static DMSA scintigraphy in the UK. Ten studies representing a
range of ages and relative function values were distributed in digital form to
100 hospitals with the assistance of the gamma camera computer suppliers and
regional audit coordinators. The studies were analysed at each participating
hospital and details of the different techniques and computer systems used were
documented. The median value of relative percentage function was assessed for
each of the studies. Methods varied in terms of the view used for analysis (54%
geometric mean, 46% posterior), the type of background subtraction (single region
32%, separate regions 60%, none 8%) and the definition of the renal regions of
interest (73% manual, 27% semi-automatic). Eighty-eight percent of results were
within two percentage points of the study median and 98% within five percentage
points. There were statistically significant differences observed in the results 
arising from the view used for the analysis and the background subtraction
protocol. The results indicate that relative renal function assessment from
static DMSA scintigraphy in the UK is essentially a reliable procedure, although 
improvements could be made by standardizing the technique used.

The aim of this study was to evaluate renal function during the acute phase of
symptomatic urinary tract infection and the changes observed several months
later. Overall glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as well as single kidney GFR
(SKGFR) were calculated using the combination of a left/right uptake ratio
obtained from technetium 99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy and
51chromium-EDTA plasma clearance. Forty-four patients with obvious unilateral or 
bilateral DMSA abnormalities were studied. In patients with unilateral lesions,
both the overall GFR and the SKGFR were significantly higher during the acute
phase of infection than several months later, on the abnormal side as well as the
normal side. The relative percentage uptake was lower on the abnormal side than
the normal side, obviously due to loss of functional parenchyma. This percentage 
increased significantly during the recovery phase, reflecting the total or
partial healing of the renal lesions, despite the decrease of the corresponding
SKGFR. However, during both the acute and the recovery phase, the relative
percentage uptake of the abnormal kidney was in the normal range and often close 
to 50%. In patients with bilateral lesions, no significant changes were observed 
between the acute phase and the recovery phase.

Interactions between the molybdenum cofactor and iron-sulfur clusters of
Escherichia coli dimethylsulfoxide reductase.

T6G 2H7.

We have used site-directed mutagenesis to study the interactions between the
molybdo-bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide) cofactor (Mo-bisMGD) and the
other prosthetic groups of Escherichia coli Me2SO reductase (DmsABC). In
redox-poised preparations, there is a significant spin-spin interaction between
the reduced Em,7 = -120 mV [4Fe-4S] cluster of DmsB and the Mo(V) of the
Mo-bisMGD of DmsA. This interaction is significantly modified in a DmsA-C38S
mutant that contains a [3Fe-4S] cluster in DmsA, suggesting that the [3Fe-4S]
cluster is in close juxtaposition to the vector connecting the Mo(V) and the Em,7
= -120 mV cluster of DmsB. In a DmsA-R77S mutant, the interaction is eliminated, 
indicating the importance of this residue in defining the interaction pathway. In
ferricyanide-oxidized glycerol-inhibited DmsAC38SBC, there is no detectable
interaction between the oxidized [3Fe-4S] cluster and the Mo-bisMGD, except for a
minor broadening of the Mo(V) spectrum. In a double mutant, DmsAS176ABC102SC,
which contains an engineered [3Fe-4S] cluster in DmsB, no significant
paramagnetic interaction is detected between the oxidized [3Fe-4S] cluster and
the Mo(V). These results have important implications for (i) understanding the
magnetic interactions between the Mo(V) and other paramagnetic centers and (ii)
delineating the electron transfer pathway from the [4Fe-4S] clusters of DmsB to
the Mo-bisMGD of DmsA.

Utility of SPECT DMSA renal scanning in the evaluation of children with primary
vesicoureteral reflux.

Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

OBJECTIVES: DMSA renal scanning is more sensitive than ultrasound in detecting
renal parenchymal scars. We proposed to determine the utility of single-photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal
scanning in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
METHODS: During a 24-month period, we evaluated the charts of 368 patients who
had undergone SPECT DMSA renal scanning for primary VUR. Patients were divided
into three age groups: (a) less than 1 year, (b) between 1 and 5 years, and (c)
older than 6 years. Renal scars were deemed severe or focal. The data were
analyzed to evaluate the utility of SPECT DMSA scanning in children with primary 
VUR and to determine the indications for performing SPECT DMSA. We also evaluated
the sensitivity of recent renal ultrasound technology in detecting focal and
diffuse scars.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-eight patients were younger than 1 year at
presentation. These included 24 cases that were detected prenatally. One hundred 
eighty-five were between the ages of 1 and 5 years, and 55 were 6 years or older.
Reflux nephropathy at presentation was found in 99 (26.9%) of 368 patients. DMSA 
scanning changed the treatment in only 13 patients (3.5%). When scarring was
diffuse, ultrasound examination correlated 100% with DMSA scanning; when focal
scarring was present, the correlation was poor.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that DMSA scans should be tailored to children
who have ultrasound abnormalities, high-grade reflux, or recurrent breakthrough
urinary tract infections. These guidelines will result in a substantial cost
savings and a significant decrease in radiation exposure.

Forschungszentrum Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany.

Diagnostically used 99mTc kit radiopharmaceuticals were analyzed using capillary 
zone electrophoresis with radioactivity detection:
99mTc-bis(bis(2-ethyloxyethyl)phosphino)ethane (99mTc-Myoview,
99mTc-Tetrofosmin),
99mTc-trans(1,2-bis(dehydro-2,2,5,5,-tetramethyl-3-furanone-4-methylene-
amino)ethane)-tris(3-methoxy-1-propyl)phosphine) (99mTc-Technescan Q12,
99mTc-Furifosmin), 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-MIBI),
99mTc-L,L-ethylenecysteine diethylester dimer (99mTc-ECD),
99mTc-d,1-hexamethylene propyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO),
99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA), 99mTc-ethylene
hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (99mTc-EHIDA), 99mTc-L,L-ethylenecysteine dimer 
(99mTc-EC), 99mTc-mercaptoacetylglycylglycylglycine (99mTc-MAG3),
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA), 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate
(99mTc-MDP) and 99mNaTcO4. A pressure-driven capillary zone electrophoresis was
employed to detect small anions of high electrophoretic mobility and cations
within one run. Effective 99mTc complex charges could be determined by a neutral 
internal standard. All complexes showed the expected electrophoretic behaviours
in view of their charges. Pure products were obtained for the majority of the
studied complexes. In the case of 99mTc-Q12, 99mTc-EHIDA and 99mTc-MDP, complex
mixtures were detected. The high potential of CE for the analysis of 99mTc
radiopharmaceuticals could be shown.

Is greater than normal nocturnal heart rate in children with renal scars a
predictor of reflux nephropathy?

Pomeranz A(1), Korzets Z, Regev A, Wolach B, Bernheim J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nephrology, Meir General Hospital, Kfar-Saba, Israel.

BACKGROUND: The existence of renal scars constitutes the major etiologic factor
for the development of hypertension during childhood. Elevated blood pressure in 
this setting can be considered a secondary form of hypertension. Certain forms of
secondary hypertension have been associated with a lower than normal nocturnal
fall in blood pressure. Resting heart rate per se has recently been reported to
be an independent predictor of risk for cardiovascular mortality irrespective of 
age and the presence or lack of hypertension.
OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the responses of heart rate and blood pressure in
normotensive children with renal scars without, however, proteinuria and renal
failure.
METHODS: Ten children with renal scars documented by a 99Tc dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) scan were subjected to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Ten
age-matched and sex-matched healthy children served as the control group. Serum
urea and creatinine levels, calculated rate of clearance of creatinine,
microalbuminuria, plasma renin activity, and levels of aldosterone and
catecholamines were determined for each subject.
RESULTS: Average daytime and night-time systolic and diastolic blood pressures
for the two groups did not differ. Subjects in both groups demonstrated the
physiologic decrease in blood pressure during sleep (normal 'dipper' response),
which was of equal magnitude for these two groups. Mean daytime heart rates were 
92+/- 13 beats/min in children with renal scars versus 80+/-11 beats/min in
controls (NS). Mean and minimal heart rates during night-time in children with
renal scars were found to be significantly greater [79+/-6 versus 65+/-5
beats/min (mean) and 61+/-10 versus 56+/-7 beats/min (minimal), P < 0.01].
Parameters of renal function, plasma renin activity, and levels of aldosterone
and catecholamines were similar for these two groups.
CONCLUSION: Despite their having an equivalent physiologic dip in blood pressure 
during night-time, normotensive children with renal scars have a significantly
greater nocturnal heart rate than do control subjects.

Quantitative 99mTc-DMSA uptake in experimental pyelonephritis.

Godley ML(1), Risdon RA, Gordon I, Parkhouse HF, Ransley PG.

Author information: 
(1)The Institute of Child Health and the Great Ormond Street Hospital for
Children NHS Trust, London, England, UK.

Quantitative 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal uptake was studied in
unilateral reflux-related pyelonephritis in pigs. The changes to absolute % dose 
uptake and differential uptake occurring with induction and after treatment of
pyelonephritis were correlated with the DMSA images and renal pathology.METHODS: 
Quantitative uptake in 53 young pigs was obtained from planar images acquired 6 h
after injecting the dose. Baseline studies were made (Q1), and studies were made 
again after urinary infection was established (Q2), when 8 pigs had normal (no
defect) renal images (group A), 23 had photon-deficient (reversible) focal
defects (group B) and 22 had photon absent (irreversible) focal defects (group
C). Q3 studies were made in 21 animals from groups B and C after 3-wk
antimicrobial treatment.
RESULTS: At Q2 the affected kidney differential uptake was unchanged for group A 
and reduced for groups B and C (respective mean changes -1.7%, P < 0.01; and
-5.5%, P < 0.01). The absolute % dose uptake was unchanged in pyelonephritic
kidneys, but increased in the contralateral nondiseased kidneys in groups B and C
(respective mean increases +1.4%, P < 0.05; and +5.4%, P < 0.01), while remaining
unchanged for group A. In group C, global renal accumulation was actually
increased above the Q1 values. After treatment (Q3) the reduced pyelonephritic
kidney differential uptake persisted in groups B and C. In group C, however, the 
increased absolute % dose uptake by the contralateral kidney was less marked and 
not significantly different from Q1 values in this small group.
CONCLUSION: Induction of unilateral pyelonephritis produced a small reduction in 
diseased kidney differential uptake that was greatest in the group with
irreversible imaging defects. The method did not discriminate individuals with
reversible and irreversible imaging defects. The decrease in pyelonephritic
kidney differential uptake resulted from increased DMSA accumulation (absolute % 
dose uptake) by the nondiseased contralateral kidney, while that in
pyelonephritic kidneys remained unchanged. After treatment, the reduced
pyelonephritic kidney differential uptake persisted, but the elevated global DMSA
accumulation seen for group C (with irreversible imaging defects) was not
sustained and was variable.

Renal sinus hyperechogenicity in acute pyelonephritis: description and
pathological correlation.

Dacher JN(1), Avni F, François A, Rypens F, Monroc M, Eurin D, Le Dosseur P.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Radiology, Hôpital Charles Nicolle, Rouen, France.

This paper reports on the association between renal sinus hyperechogenicity and
acute pyelonephritis. The medical records and imaging studies of 18 children
displaying this pattern were retrospectively studied. Thickening of the renal
pelvis and renal enlargement were the most frequent associated sonographic
abnormalities. Further subtle findings can be found on sonography and
colour/power Doppler. Their identification can help in the diagnostic approach to
acute pyelonephritis and may obviate the need for other imaging modalities such
as enhanced CT or 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy. Renal sinus hyperechogenicity was also
identified in a parallel study performed in female rabbits with experimental
pyelonephritis and was shown, histologically, to be related to exudates of fibrin
and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, interstitial oedema and micro-abscesses.

Persistent effect of in utero meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on immune
function and lead-induced immunotoxicity.

Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, 
Ithaca, NY 14853-6401, USA.

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a drug currently employed for cheltion
therapy in lead poisoning; however, little is known about its potential effects
on the immune system. To examine the effect of DMSA and its capacity to reverse
immunotoxicity resulting from exposure to lead in utero, female Fischer 344 rats 
were administered lead acetate in drinking water from 2 weeks prior to mating
until parturition; DMSA was given by gavage on days 6-21 of gestation. The immune
function of the female offspring was tested at 13 weeks of age. The results
showed that lead (250 ppm) suppressed Th1-type responses (delayed-type
hypersensitivity (DTH), interferon gamma (IFN gamma) production), enhanced a
Th2-type response (interleukin-4 (IL-4) production), and increased tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF alpha) production from macrophages. DMSA treatment (60 mg/kg
per day) during pregnancy significantly lowered the blood lead levels of both the
embryos and the lactating dams as well as the milk lead level of lactating dams. 
The chelation treatment also reversed the lead-induced alterations in pup body
weight, relative spleen weight, TNF alpha, and IL-4 production. But in utero
exposure to DMSA alone resulted in decreased DTH response in adult offspring.
This was likely due to a reduced cell recruitment, since plasma monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels were decreased. The DMSA-exposed
offspring also demonstrated increased interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. These
results suggest that DMSA reverses some of the lead-induced immunotoxicity;
however, this treatment itself during embryonic development produces subsequent
adult immunomodulation.

AIM: The objectives of the study were to confirm the efficacy of extracorporeal
shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in infants and children and to evaluate potential
long-term renal parenchymal damage by 99m Tc DMSA renal scan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 1989 and November 1997, 39 children
between 10 months and 17-1/2 years of age (average: 7 years) were treated by
extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for kidney or ureteral stones with a
Sonolith 3000 lithotriptor (Technomed Corp). Forty-six stones were treated. Eight
metabolic and 11 urological abnormalities were identified. The evaluation of the 
treatment and its consequences were based on a clinical examination, conventional
imaging and a DMSA renal scan performed 24 h before extracorporeal shock wave
lithotripsy and at least 6 months after treatment.
RESULTS: Treatment was successful (stone fragmented and eliminated) in 84.6% at 3
months after one to four sessions. Sixty-one sessions were necessary and two
patients underwent open surgery for failed extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.
Three recurrences were also retreated. At long term follow-up (6 months to 8
years) no incidents of high blood pressure were observed, nor parenchymal lesions
imputable to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of the extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for
children is proven. This study also confirms the innocuousness of extracorporeal 
shock wave lithotripsy for renal parenchyma even in infants. However, long term
follow-up and further evaluation with the other categories of lithotriptors are
necessary to make definitive conclusions.

Pediatric urinary tract reconstruction using intestine.

Clementson Kockum C(1), Helin I, Malmberg L, Malmfors G.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Surgery, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse the outcome of urinary tract reconstruction in children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen children with bladder exstrophy or neurogenic
bladder, 4-18 years old, were followed in accordance with a predetermined program
for bladder augmentation (13 pat) or continent urinary reservoir (2 pat). The
follow-up time was 1.7-6.3 years, median 3.7 years.
RESULTS: All were dry, though one case had occasional leaks. Three bladder neck
reconstructions, two artificial sphincters, one sling plasty and one fistula
closure with subsequent bladder neck injection were required. Bladder volumes
were adequate for age at low pressures. Reflux resolved in 12/13 ureters. A boy
with preoperative renal insufficiency was transplanted. Total renal function
remained otherwise stable despite acidosis in one case and some glomerular
impairment in all. Progressive parenchymal lesions were seen in combination with 
abundant mucus, infections and calculi only. Growth and bowel function was
unaffected. Bone mineral density showed overall increase; some low values were
not consistent between investigations.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary tract reconstruction in children results in continence and
regression of reflux. Growth, bone mineralization and renal function are
unimpaired during the first years, but irrigation of the bladder is essential to 
minimize the risk of urinary tract infection. However, glomerular function might 
be affected and the possible risk of metabolic complications in later life can
only be determined by continuous close monitoring over an extended period of
time.

We report the synthesis, characterization, and biodistribution of 99mTc-complexes
with the bidentate-N,N chelate biguanide (Big) and the N1-substituted ligands
dimethyl (DMBig), phenyl (PBig), and phenethyl (PEBig). Dynamic gamma-camera
studies with 99mTc-Big and 99mTc-DMSA in rabbits indicated distinct renal and
urinary excretion profiles. 99mTc-Big was cleared more quickly than 99mTc-DMSA,
and for the same acquisition times, the contrast in whole-body images favored
99mTc-Big. Also, the estimated radiation absorbed doses by kidneys and blood for 
99mTc-DMSA were significantly higher than for 99mTc-Big. These preliminary
studies show that 99mTc-Big has favourable practical and dosimetric features for 
renal imaging as an alternative to 99mTc-DMSA.

Supranormal renographic differential renal function in congenital hydronephrosis:
fact, not artifact.

Capolicchio G(1), Jednak R, Dinh L, Salle JL, Brzezinski A, Houle AM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Montreal Children's Hospital, McGill University Health 
Center, Quebec, Canada.

PURPOSE: Children with unilateral hydronephrosis, who had been prospectively
examined with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and dimercapto-succinic
acid (DMSA) renography, were evaluated to determine whether supranormal
renographic differential renal function exists.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 54 children with congenital single system
hydronephrosis underwent abdominal ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram, and DTPA
and DMSA renal scans. None had abnormalities of the bladder or contralateral
kidney. Differential renal function greater than 55% was defined as supranormal.
RESULTS: Of the 54 patients 15 (28%) with a median age of 4 months (range 0.5 to 
66) were identified with supranormal renographic renal function on either DTPA or
DMSA. Supranormal renographic renal function was detected by DMSA in 9 cases
(mean 57+/-2%), DTPA in 8 (mean 58+/-2%) and both in 2 (mean 57+/-2%). Average
function demonstrated in the 15 patients was 55+/-3% (range 51 to 62) with DMSA
which was not different from that found with DTPA (mean 55+/-4%, range 46 to
61%). The kidneys with supranormal renographic renal function were significantly 
larger than hydronephrotic controls according to longitudinal parenchymal area on
DMSA. Mean followup was 20 months for 13 patients, with 8 of 13 (62%) undergoing 
pyeloplasty. Followup DTPA renal scans available in 9 children revealed
persistent supranormal function in 6, despite pyeloplasty in 3.
CONCLUSIONS: Supranormal renographic differential renal function does exist in
congenital hydronephrosis and when found the kidneys are consistently enlarged.
The position of supranormal renographic renal function in the management
algorithm of hydronephrosis remains to be elucidated as it does not appear to be 
a benign prognostic factor.

Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most important heavy metal environmental toxicants. It
alters a wide variety of cellular and biochemical processes. The objective of
this work was to study DNA damage and recovery after acute and chronic CdCl2
treatment in a human fetal hepatic cell line (WRL-68 cells). Using the alkaline
microgel electrophoresis assay that detects DNA single-strand breaks and/or
alkali-labile sites in individual cells, we evaluated for levels of DNA damage.
The mean migration length in control cells was 35.37+/-1. 43 microm (8% damaged
cells), whereas the mean migration in cells treated with 0.005 microM CdCl2 for 3
h (acute low dose) was 65. 87+/-2.07 microm (88% damaged cells). Treatment with
0.01 microM CdCl2 for the same time (acute high dose) increased the mean
migration length to 125.79+/-2.91 microm (92% damaged cells). However, a 0.005
microM CdCl2 treatment for 7 days (chronic treatment) only increased 65% DNA
migration to 58.38+/-2.59 microm (88% damaged nucleus). Lipoperoxidative damage
expressed as malondialdehyde (MDA) production per milligram of protein was 15.
7+/-2.6 for control cells, whereas in Cd-treated cells the values were 20.2+/-2.4
(acute low dose), 22.9+/-2.2 (acute high dose), and 22.6+/-2.1 (chronic
treatment). To study the repair of DNA damage, cells were washed with 0.01 microM
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), and fresh Dulbecco's modified essential 
medium (DMEM) added. The percentage of damaged cells diminished after 90 min,
with DNA migration returning to control values by 120 min. Cd treatment produced 
DNA single-strand breaks and the damage was greater in acute high dose treated
cells. Lipid peroxidation values did not correlate with DNA single-strand breaks.

In 38 children with proved P-fimbriated Escherichia coli acute pyelonephritis,
Tc-99m DTPA dynamic renal scintigraphy in the zoom mode using deconvolution
analysis was performed, and the results were compared with those of Tc-99m DMSA
scans. From the dynamic study, six functional images of the mean time were
generated. Each functional image was analyzed separately to search for focal
areas of increased mean time within the kidney contour, especially over the
kidney parenchyma. Time-activity curves from these areas were generated and
analyzed. Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy showed generalized or focal decreased uptake
in 32 (41.8%) kidneys, and deconvolution analysis of Tc-99m DTPA scintigraphy
revealed pathologic renographic curves in 58 (77.6%) kidneys. Prolonged
whole-kidney and normal renal parenchymal transit times (dilatation without
obstruction) were found in 38 (50%) kidneys, whereas prolonged whole-kidney and
renal parenchymal transit times (dilatation with obstruction) were observed in 20
(27.6%) kidneys. Separate analysis of each of the six functional images of the
mean time showed focal areas of increased mean time in the kidney parenchyma of
11 kidneys. In five cases, time-activity curves from these areas showed a sharp
increase of activity on the descending part of the curve, which might reflect the
return of urine from the collecting system into kidney cortex (i.e., intrarenal
reflux). These results showed that in a urinary tract with acute pyelonephritis, 
urodynamic changes may lead to obstructive nephropathy and intrarenal reflux.

six functional images of the mean time has proved to be a valuable method to
evaluate acute pyelonephritis, thus allowing dynamic and morphologic analysis of 
the urinary tract at the same time.

of China.

As a result of a high percentage of hypoactive upper poles of kidneys in
traditional 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) SPECT, a prospective study was
conducted using 180 degrees acquisition technique compared with 360 degrees to
minimize tissue attenuation.METHODS: Anterior 180 degrees, posterior 180 degrees 
and 360 degrees renal SPECT images were obtained simultaneously using a dual-head
camera. Forty-one subjects without renal disease and 16 subjects with 21 cortical
defects were included in this study. The total counts of the raw data in the
anterior 180 degrees, posterior 180 degrees and full 360 degrees were calculated.
Small regions of interest were drawn over the cortex of the kidney on coronal and
reoriented sagittal slices. Quantitative evaluation of regional activity was
performed on the same frames in all three acquisition methods.
RESULTS: Comparison of the total renal counts between the anterior and posterior 
180 degrees data showed reduced counts in the anterior 180 degrees data
collection (P < 0.01). Visual evaluation of the reconstructed images from
anterior 180 degrees, posterior 180 degrees and full 360 degrees data collection 
showed the best image uniformity in the posterior 180 degrees image. The
upper/lower pole ratio in the posterior 180 degrees renal SPECT images increased 
significantly in comparison to full 360 degrees renal SPECT images (P < 0.01) and
anterior 180 degrees SPECT images (P < 0.01). The renal defects were more clearly
visualized in the posterior 180 degrees renal SPECT images than the full 360
degrees renal SPECT images. The defect/normal cortex ratios in the posterior 180 
degrees renal SPECT images were much lower than those from the full 360 degrees
SPECT images (P < 0.01) and those from the anterior 180 degrees SPECT images (P <
0.01).
CONCLUSION: The posterior 180 degrees acquisition technique can avoid the problem
of hypoactive upper pole and can be less time consuming in 99mTc-DMSA SPECT
images. It also provides superior lesion contrast in the clinical evaluation of
patients with renal scarring.

Quantitative SPECT uptake of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid by the kidneys in
children.

Groshar D(1), Gorenberg M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Bnai Zion Medical Center and Rebecca Sieff
Government Hospital, Safed, Israel.

The normal range of values for quantitative SPECT of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) uptake by the kidneys in children was studied.METHODS: Renal
functioning volume, percentage of injected dose per cubic centimeter of renal
tissue (%ID/ cm3) and individual kidney uptake of 270 kidneys performed on 135
children, aged 2 wk-15 y, provided the basic data for this study. The accrual was
part of the work-up of children with urinary tract infection where no structural 
or functional abnormalities of the renal tract could be established. Children
were grouped according to age intervals, and a distribution chart was obtained
with 2 SD above and below the mean of the values obtained for volume (%ID/cm3)
and kidney uptake in each age group.
RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between age and functional volume (r
= 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.92; P = 0.000), and a significant
inverse correlation was found between age and %ID/cm3 (r = -0.86; 95% CI, -0.88
to -0.82; P = 0.000). No statistically significant correlation was found between 
age and kidney uptake (r = -0.20; 95% CI, -0.32 to -0.09; P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: It seems that the normal maturational changes in renal function
observed in infants and newborns do not affect the kidney uptake of 99mTC-DMSA.
Thus, quantitation of 99mTc-DMSA uptake by the kidneys can be used to assess
changes in the individual renal function over time in this age group.

Overall and single-kidney clearance in children with urinary tract infection and 
damaged kidneys.

Arnello F(1), Ham HR, Tondeur M, Piepsz A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Academic Hospital, Vrije Universiteit Brussel,
Brussels, Belgium.

The overall and single-kidney clearance in children with acute urinary tract
infection was investigated retrospectively using the combination of the relative 
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake and the
51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid clearance.METHODS: There were 180 patients
with both normal kidneys, 56 with clear unilateral abnormalities on DMSA
scintigraphy and 11 with two abnormal kidneys. Half of the patients were younger 
than 2 y, and because of the progressive maturation of the renal function, they
were not considered in the analysis of the absolute overall and single-kidney
clearance; nevertheless, they were included in the analysis of the relative DMSA 
percentage uptake.
RESULTS: When only one kidney was affected on DMSA scintigraphy, the clearance of
the affected kidney was lower than on the normal side and often abnormally low.
In these unilaterally affected kidneys, contralateral compensation mechanisms
tended to occur, resulting in preservation of overall clearance. This
compensation was probably not present only on the contralateral side. On the
abnormal side, the clearance was normal in about half of the cases, probably
because of intrarenal compensation occurring in regions not damaged by the
infection. In addition to these compensation mechanisms, hyperfiltration was
probably present in many cases of acute urinary tract infection with intact or
unilaterally damaged kidneys.

Features of primary vesicoureteric reflux detected by investigation of foetal
hydronephrosis.

Oliveira EA(1), Diniz JS, Silva JM, Rabelo EA, Pontes AK, Souza MF.

(1)Department of Paediatrics, Hospital das Clínicas, Federal University of Minas 
Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

Primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) diagnosed on investigation of foetal
hydronephrosis accounts for many antenatally detected uropathies. In order to
study foetal VUR and its consequences, newborns with foetal hydronephrosis were
investigated by ultrasound, micturating cystourethrogram and
99mTechnetium-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA), after beginning of
chemoprophylaxis. Twenty-eight infants with VUR (bilateral in 15 cases) were
identified giving a total 43 renal units for study. There was a predominance of
males (86%), moderate/severe reflux (84%) and renal damage (51%). Presence of
renal damage was correlated with the severity of reflux. VUR should be
investigated in cases of foetal hydronephrosis and our results support that renal
damage is frequently congenital and not secondary to urinary tract infection.

Comment in
    Eur J Nucl Med. 1999 Dec;26(12):1627-8.

Differential renal function (DRF) is an important parameter that should be
assessed from virtually every dynamic renogram. With the introduction of
technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mTc-MAG3), a tracer with a high renal 
extraction, the estimation of DRF might hopefully become accurate and
reproducible both between observers in the same institution and also between
institutions. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of different
parameters on the estimation of DRF. To this end we investigated two groups of
children: group A, comprising 35 children with a single kidney (27 of whom had
poor renal function), and group B, comprising 20 children with two kidneys and
normal global function who also had an associated 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
scan (99mTc-DMSA). The variables assessed for their effect on the estimation of
DRF were: different operators, the choice of renal regions of interest (ROIs),
the applied background subtraction, and six different techniques for analysis of 
the renogram. The six techniques were based on: linear regression of the slopes
in the Rutland-Patlak plot, matrix deconvolution, differential method, integral
method, linear regression of the slope of the renograms, and the area under the
curve of the renogram. The estimation of DRF was less dependent upon both
observer and method in patients with two normally functioning kidneys than in
patients with a single kidney. The inter-observer comparison among children in
either group was not dependent on either ROI or background subtraction. However, 
in patients with poor renal function the method of choice for the estimation of
DRF was dependent on background subtraction, though not ROI. In children with two
kidneys and normal renal function, the estimation of DRF from the 24 techniques
gave similar results. Methods that produced DRF values closest to expected
results, from either group of children, were the Rutland-Patlak plot and matrix
deconvolution methods.

Use of the Caco-2 cell model to assess the relative lead-chelating ability of
diasterioisomers of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Pigman EA(1), Lott JR, Fernando Q, Blanchard J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arizona, College of
Pharmacy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.

The purpose of this study was to examine the mechanisms of lead (Pb) uptake by
human intestinal cells and to compare the intestinal transport and relative
lead-chelating ability of two diastereoisomeric forms (i.e., meso and racemic) of
2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The model used was the human adenocarcinoma 
(Caco-2) cell monolayer. The Caco-2 cells were cultured in flasks for examination
of cellular uptake of lead and subsequent chelation of the lead by the DMSA
isomers. For assessment of the comparative intestinal transport of the
diastereoisomers, the Caco-2 cells were cultured on semipermeable supports. The
effects of N-ethylmaleimide and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D3) on the
uptake of lead by the Caco-2 monolayer were examined to determine the
contributions of sulfhydryl-binding and calcium-binding protein, respectively, to
the lead uptake process. Analysis of lead was performed using both macro- and
micro-proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), and DMSA was measured
spectrophotometrically following derivatization with
5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid. Results from micro-PIXE imaging suggest that 
lead is bound on the surface of the cell, and that sulfhydryl binding may be an
important step in the uptake of lead by the Caco-2 cells. Macro-PIXE results
indicate that the racemic form of DMSA may be more effective in chelating lead
from within the cell. Comparison of the transport of the two DMSA
diastereoisomers indicates that the racemic form is transported across the Caco-2
monolayer more readily than the meso form.

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in the treatment of occupationally exposed lead 
workers.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) treatment in workers with increased lead absorption and no overt
symptoms of lead poisoning. Seven occupationally lead exposed male workers with
blood lead concentrations (PbB) exceeding 50 micrograms/100 ml and a positive
calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) lead mobilization test were
treated with DMSA for 19 days. Individual doses were 700 mg DMSA, three times a
day from day one to five, and twice a day from day six to 19. The treatment
intensified urinary lead excretion, most rapidly during the first five days. The 
increased elimination was followed by a decline of mean PbB to 15% of the
pretreatment values. However, 15 days after the treatment, the PbB concentrations
rebounded, yet kept below the baseline values and did not exceed 40
micrograms/100 ml. After repeated EDTA lead mobilization test, urine lead was
23-68% of that before DMSA treatment. It can be concluded that DMSA can
effectively reduce chelatable lead in occupationally exposed workers.

In Japanese patients idiopathic tubular proteinuria presents mainly as
asymptomatic tubular low molecular weight proteinuria. This disease has recently 
been shown to resemble Dent's disease which is characterized by tubular
proteinuria, hypercalciuria, rickets and eventual renal failure. We report on 4
children with idiopathic tubular proteinuria. Although they had normal renal
function, as evidenced by serum creatinine or creatinine clearance, they had very
poor renal accumulation of 99mTc-DMSA and the presence of large amounts of tracer
in the bladder. Additionally, the patient with the largest amounts of tubular
proteinuria had the poorest renal accumulation of the 4 patients. The renal
accumulation of tracer decreased with time from a maximum at 10 min after
injection. These findings demonstrate that the tracer, once taken to be confined 
to the proximal tubular cells, is immediately excreted to the tubular lumen. We
suggest that poor renal accumulation of 99mTc-DMSA is very important in
elucidating the mechanism of idiopathic tubular proteinuria, and that 99mTc-DMSA 
renoscintigraphy is useful in the evaluation of the patient's renal function over
time.

Incontinence due to an infrasphincteric ectopic ureter: why the delay in
diagnosis and what the radiologist can do about it.

Carrico C(1), Lebowitz RL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 300
Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

PURPOSE: To determine (1) the reasons for the frequently long delay in the
diagnosis of an infrasphincteric ectopic ureter in girls, and (2) what role the
radiologist can play in decreasing the delay.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve girls were referred to our hospital from June 1994 
until April 1997 for evaluation of constant urinary dribbling and/or vaginal
discharge. Available imaging studies, radiology reports, and clinic notes were
reviewed.
RESULTS: Mean age at the time of diagnosis was 6 years 7 months (range 2 years 10
months to 11 years 11 months). Mean delay until diagnosis after presentation was 
2 years 5 months. Excluding the one girl whose ectopic ureter was diagnosed while
she was still in diapers, mean age at the time of the first parental "complaint" 
was 4 years 9 months. The significance of the classic history of constant urinary
dribbling was not recognized by physicians in 7 girls for 4 months to 7 years 10 
months after presentation. Physical exam was not meticulously performed, as the
ectopic orifice was visible in 8 of 12 girls. Imaging studies were ineffectively 
utilized: no imaging was done (for 2 years in 2 girls), inappropriate studies
were done (ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography) and were misleading,
studies were called normal when they were not (ultrasound and excretory
urography), or perinatal imaging led to the incorrect assumption of a
congenitally absent kidney in one girl and a multicystic dysplastic kidney in
another. Excretory urography (EU) was diagnostic in all 10 girls with a duplex
kidney, and computed tomography (CT) was supportive in 2 with a dysplastic
kidney. CT was an adjunct in 3 girls; a Tc-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scan was needed in 2.
CONCLUSION: The classic history of constant urinary dribbling in a successfully
toilet-trained girl should immediately lead to an imaging search for the portion 
of kidney (or entire kidney) drained by an infrasphincteric ectopic ureter. EU
should usually be the first imaging performed and is often the only imaging study
needed.

Determination of the biodistribution of radiopharmaceuticals is an important
issue for the evaluation of their performance in diagnosis and therapy. In this
study, we evaluated a digital radioimager (RI) based on a multiwire proportional 
chamber for quantitative autoradiography (AR). The RI allows direct detection of 
electronic emissions of gamma emitters. Its qualitative and quantitative
performances were tested on 99mTc and (111)In labelled sections and compared with
conventional film AR. Linearity of count rate versus activity was verified over a
104 range of activity. As compared with film AR, a substantial improvement of the
detection limit was obtained even for acquisition periods up to 20 times less
than film exposure times. We provided the basis for quantitative analysis with
tissue equivalent paste standards: the 99mTc and (111)In RI counting efficiencies
were respectively 1.19% and 2.35%. We illustrated the respective values of RI and
film AR in two rat studies: 99mTc-DMSA in kidney and dual-isotope 99mTc-MIBI and 
(111)In-antimyosin in heart. Calculated activity concentrations on sections of
rat organs confirmed good correlation to gamma counting (deviation less than
12%). We suggest RI as a convenient technique for fast localization of single or 
dual-isotope tracers and determination of activity distribution.

Technetium-99m(V)-DMSA and gallium-67 in the assessment of bone and joint
infection.

Lee BF(1), Chiu NT, Chang JK, Liu GC, Yu HS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical
College Hospital, Taiwan.

The aim of our study was to investigate the diagnostic value of scans with
99mTc(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) to localize bone and joint infection
compared with scans using 67Ga.METHODS: Thirty-six patients referred for
investigation of bone and joint infection were studied. In all patients, a bone
scan was obtained initially. Subsequently, comparative scans with 99mTc(V)-DMSA
and 67Ga were performed 1 wk apart. Microbiological findings, pathologic findings
and/or clinical follow-up (until symptoms disappeared) were considered to be
proof of the presence of bone and joint infection.
RESULTS: Technetium-99m (V)-DMSA showed greater sensitivity and accuracy than
67Ga in the assessment of bone and joint infection, although the difference was
not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: In comparison with a 67Ga scan, a 99mTc(V)-DMSA scan, in combination 
with a bone scan, is a reliable way to diagnose bone and joint infection. Both
tracers were useful in the diagnosis of bone and joint infection.

Identification of new renal scarring in repeated episodes of acute pyelonephritis
using Tc-99m DMSA renal SPECT.

Yen TC(1), Tzen KY, Lin WY, Chen WP, Lin CY.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, School of
Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taipei, Taiwan.

PURPOSE: This prospective study compared the value of Tc-99m DMSA renal planar
scintigraphy with SPECT to detect new renal involvement in patients with repeated
episodes of acute pyelonephritis (APN).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with suspected APN were transferred to our
department for DMSA renal scans. Seventy-two children (ages 1 week to 15 years)
had DMSA planar and SPECT imaging performed twice because of clinical or
laboratory suspicion of repeated APN. In addition, radiographic voiding
cystourethrography was also performed in all cases. The presence of
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was graded on a scale of 0 to 5.
RESULTS: New lesions were observed with SPECT in 56 kidneys and with planar
scintigraphy in 38 kidneys. No patients had a negative result of Tc-99m DMSA
renal SPECT who also had a positive Tc-99m DMSA planar result. The degree of VUR 
as related to APN was diagnosed better with SPECT than with planar scintigraphy
(46 compared with 30 and 10 compared with 8, respectively). There is a
significant difference (P < 0.05) between the diagnostic ability of these two
methods to identify the increased tendency of repeated APN to occur with
high-grade VUR compared with low-grade or no VUR.
CONCLUSIONS: High-grade VUR is more commonly associated with renal injury than is
low-grade or no VUR. If only Tc-99m DMSA renal planar scintigraphy is performed, 
renal scarring may be underestimated. Our results suggest that Tc-99m DMSA renal 
SPECT, rather than planar scintigraphy, should be used routinely in children with
a clinical suspicion of APN, especially for those with scarred kidneys and
high-grade VUR.

Successful treatment of acute inferior vena cava and unilateral renal vein
thrombosis by local infusion of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.

Lam KK(1), Lui CC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Kaohsiung,
Hsien, Taiwan. lamkk@ksts.seed.net.tw

Renal vein thrombosis can occur as a complication of nephrotic syndrome. We
present the case of a young man with nephrotic syndrome caused by minimal change 
disease who developed acute inferior vena cava and left renal vein thrombosis. He
was treated initially with intravenous heparin. Because of the persistence of
severe left flank pain and gross hematuria, local infusion of recombinant tissue 
plasminogen activator was tried, with resolution of thrombi and subsidence of
symptoms. Functional preservation of the involved kidney is good, as indicated by
Tc-99m DMSA scan (involved kidney, 47.4%; uninvolved kidney, 52.6%).
Anticoagulation is usually recommended as the treatment of choice in renal vein
thrombosis. We believe that in cases with critical presentations, such as
bilateral involvement, extension into inferior vena cava, acute renal failure,
pulmonary embolism or severe flank pain, thrombolytic therapy should be
considered as a second-line treatment if good response is not obtained with
heparin.

Sodium stibogluconate (pentostan) overdose in a patient with acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome.

Reymond JM(1), Desmeules J.

Author information: 
(1)Medical Clinic 1, Department of Internal Medicine, Geneva University Hospital,
Switzerland.

A 32-year-old man with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) admitted to the 
hospital for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis was inadvertently given 10 times
the prescribed first dose of sodium stibogluconate ([Sb] 6.5 g instead of 0.65
g). He experienced no immediate major toxicity during the first 48 hours, but a
significant rise of pancreatic enzyme activities was observed (amylase at 10
times the upper limit of normal, lipase at 50 times the upper limit of normal)
without clinical signs or indications on computed tomography (CT) of
pancreatitis. The third day after the overdose, he developed appendicitis, which 
appeared coincidental; he recovered uneventfully from surgery. Most of the
overdose of Sb was eliminated within the first few hours. Pharmacokinetics
remained linear; the rapid, long elimination half-lives (2.7 hours and 54 hours, 
respectively) were similar to those in previously published results. The
administration of a chelating agent, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 72 hours
after the Sb overdose did not modify the pharmacokinetics of the medication.

The importance of 99Tcm-DMSA renal scintigraphy in the follow-up of acute
pyelonephritis in children: comparison with urographic data.

(1)Department of Paediatrics, CHU Saint Etienne, Hôpital Nord, Saint Etienne,
France.

At present, 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy is the most
sensitive examination for the detection of parenchymal damage during acute
pyelonephritis (APN) in children. This prospective study had three aims: (1) to
evaluate the medium-term evolution of the scintigraphic abnormalities, to find a 
prognostic criterion of scintigraphic evolution; (2) to assess the correlation
between the severity of early or late scintigraphic damage and selected clinical 
factors; and (3) to compare the permanent scintigraphic renal scars with
intravenous urography (IVU) 2 years after the acute infection. Seventy-four
children (mean age 32 months), presenting with a first clinical episode of
pyelonephritis and an initial scintigraphic abnormality, were included in the
study. Patients with a history of urinary tract infection (UTI), uropathy other
than vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) and a relapse of acute pyelonephritis were
excluded. All children underwent control scintigraphy (mean 9 months after APN)
and 43 had an IVU (mean 26 months after APN). Fifty-seven children (77%) still
have scintigraphic abnormalities of varying severity (7 atrophic kidneys).
Initial relative DMSA uptake of less than 45% results in a worse scintigraphic
prognosis. The age of the child has no bearing on the severity of the initial
renal involvement or on the evolution of the scintigraphic abnormalities. The
rapid introduction of antibiotics (< 12 h) significantly improves the
scintigraphic prognosis (P < 0.01). The presence of reflux (n = 39) leads to more
serious initial damage, but we did not find any effect on later evolution in this
study, in which all reflux was low grade in nature. Among the 43 children who had
an IVU, 5 showed typical urographic and scintigraphic renal scars in the
corresponding region and 38 showed a normal IVU with 28 cases of scintigraphic
abnormalities. A DMSA scan is more sensitive than IVU for the detection of renal 
scarring after a first episode of APN.

Kidney scintigraphy using 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a common gamma 
camera investigation in paediatric patients. The present study deals with methods
of calculating the activity to be administered to children. Our aim is to find a 
method of calculation which gives the same count density in the gamma camera
images for all ages. Four different methods, based on body weight, height, body
surface area and a theoretical model, are compared. The count density in the
images of the kidneys was studied retrospectively in 85 patients aged between 3
weeks and 19.5 years. Fourteen young adults aged 22.0-31.9 years were also
studied. Two of the calculation methods, based on body surface area and the
theoretical model, showed no apparent age dependency (i.e. a constant count
density was observed for all ages). The variation between individuals was similar
with both methods, but only the body surface area method gave a count density
comparable to that for the young adults. As the method based on body surface area
is also easy to implement, this method is recommended.

Transperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy in children.

Davies BW(1), Najmaldin AS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatric Surgery, St. James University Hospital, Leeds, UK.

Over a 40-month period, 24 consecutive children (1-15 years) underwent
laparoscopic nephrectomy. The indication for surgery was a poorly functioning
kidney (<6% on DMSA isotope scanning) secondary to a variety of causes, with or
without pain or infection. Four cannulas were used in each patient. The kidney
was approached through a small incision in the upper paracolic gutter without
mobilization of the colon. The procedure was successful in all but one child, who
had conversion to open technique because of poor laparoscopic viewing. In 12
children who required nephroureterectomy, the distal ureter was approached by an 
open technique through either a small extension of the iliac fossa cannula site
or a Pfannenstiel incision for combined bladder surgery. The average operating
time for laparoscopy was 85 (range 40-160) minutes. The children undergoing
nephrectomy or nephroureterectomy alone had an average hospital stay of 2 (range 
1-4) days. There were no laparoscopic or surgical complications. Laparoscopy
provides a safe and successful approach to pediatric nephrectomy. The technique
combines well with an open approach to the distal ureter when nephroureterectomy 
is indicated.

Paris, France.

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the long-term effects of extra-corporeal
shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) on the renal parenchyma of children using DMSA-Tc
99m scintigraphy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between November 1989 and April 1997, twenty-three children
wee treated for renal stones using a SONOLITH 3000 lithotriptor (Technomed-Corp. 
Evaluation of treatment and its consequences was based on clinical examination,
conventional imaging and comparison with DMSA-TC 99m renal scintigraphy performed
the day before and at least 6 months after treatment.
RESULTS: The success rate (fragmented and eliminated stones) was 90% at 6 months.
Long-term follow-up did not reveal any alteration of blood pressure or renal
function. Scintigraphic examinations did not demonstrate any significant
parenchymal lesions attributable to treatment.
CONCLUSION: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is effective in adults and
young children. Its safety on the renal parenchyma was demonstrated during this
study. However, evaluation of larger series with the use of other lithotriptors
is necessary before reaching any definitive conclusions.

The DMSA scan in paediatric urinary tract infection.

Ditchfield MR(1), Nadel HR.

Author information: 
(1)British Columbia's Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.

The objective of the present paper was to review the use of the
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan in urinary tract infection at British
Columbia's Children's Hospital to determine the frequency of cortical defects and
the association between vesico-ureteric reflux and the presence of cortical
defects in children with urinary tract infection. A total of 129 consecutive
children with a urinary tract infection referred for a DMSA scan in a 2-year
period (January 1992-January 1994) were retrospectively studied. The results were
analysed in terms of kidneys, and the incidence of cortical defects was
determined. Eighty-eight patients (68%) had a radiographic micturating
cysto-urethrogram within 6 months of the DMSA scan, and in this group the
relationship of defects with vesico-ureteric reflux was determined. Overall,
81/258 (31%) of kidneys had a cortical defect on a DMSA scan. Of those who had a 
micturating cysto-urethrogram, 53/176 (30%) kidneys had vesico-ureteric reflux,
and of those that had reflux, 21/53 (40%) had a cortical defect on a DMSA scan.
In the group of children without reflux, 38/123 (31%) had a cortical defect.
Renal cortical scan defects are common findings in paediatric urinary infection, 
and frequently occur in the absence of vesico-ureteric reflux. These defects
represent either established scars or acute pyelonephritis that can proceed to
scarring. The micturating cysto-urethrogram alone is insufficient as a screening 
modality to identify those kidneys at risk of renal scarring.

OBJECTIVE: In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary
tract infection (UTI), we measured serum procalcitonin levels, a recently
described marker of infection. We compared it with other commonly used
inflammatory markers and evaluated its ability to predict renal involvement as
assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.
METHODS: Serum C-reactive protein, leukocyte counts, and procalcitonin levels
were measured in 80 children, 1 month to 16 years of age, admitted for suspected 
pyelonephritis. Renal involvement was assessed by 99mTe-DMSA scintigraphy in the 
first 5 days after admission. The examination was repeated at least 3 months
later if the first result was abnormal.
RESULTS: In lower UTI, the mean procalcitonin (PCT) was 0.38 micrograms/L +/-
0.19 compared with 5.37 micrograms/L +/- 1.9 in pyelonephritis. In these two
groups, respectively, leukocyte counts were 10939/mm3 +/- 834 and 17429/mm3 +/-
994, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were 30.3 mg/L +/- 7.6 and 120.8 mg/L
+/- 8.9. When inflammatory markers were correlated to the severity of the renal
lesion as ranked by DMSA scintigraphy, we found a highly significant correlation 
with plasma levels of PCT, but borderline significance with CRP and none with
leukocyte counts. Patients without vesicoureteral reflux had a mean PCT of 5.16
micrograms/L +/- 2.33, which was not significantly different from that in
patients with reflux who had a mean PCT of 5.76 micrograms/L +/- 3.49. For the
prediction of renal lesions at admission, CRP had a sensitivity of 100% and a
specificity of 26.1%. The sensitivity and specificity of PCT were 70.3% and
82.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that serum PCT levels were increased significantly in
children with febrile UTI when renal parenchymal involvement (assessed by DMSA
scintigraphy) was present and allowed for prediction of patients at risk of
severe renal lesions.

OBJECTIVES: In the absence of specific symptomatology in children and neurogenic 
bladder disease patients, the early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is a
challenge. The aim of the present study was to determine if dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) lesion-positive (acute pyelonephritis) patients have elevated urinary
alpha1-microglobulin (alpha1-MG) excretion (no false negatives) and if DMSA
lesion-negative (cystitis) patients have normal urinary alpha1-MG excretion (no
false positives).
METHODS: A selected population of 62 children above 3 months of age with a proven
urinary tract infection were administered a DMSA scan. A control scan was
performed after the acute phase of the illness, and the diagnosis of
pyelonephritis (n = 44) was made retrospectively. The urinary alpha1-MG was
determined by immunonephelometry.
RESULTS: The urinary alpha1-MG-creatinine ratio was highly sensitive (98%) and
specific (100%) and correlated with the DMSA scintigraphy images. Only 1 of the
44 patients with pyelonephritis and all of the cystitis patients (n = 18) had a
normal urinary alpha1-MG (<10 mg/g). The drop in absolute DMSA uptake correlated 
significantly (r = 0. 758, p < 0.001) with the urinary alpha1-MG-creatinine
ratio. The urinary alpha1-MG-creatinine ratio was significantly higher (p < 0.
02) in bilateral than in unilateral pyelonephritis.
CONCLUSION: DMSA lesion-positive (acute pyelonephritis) patients have elevated
urinary alpha1-MG excretion and DMSA lesion-negative (cystitis) patients have
normal urinary alpha1-MG excretion.

The early detection of all tumor sites in patients with medullary thyroid
carcinoma (MTC) before primary surgery is important, because MTC tends to
metastasize to regional lymph nodes of the neck and mediastinum early during the 
course of the disease.METHODS: In an approach to localize the primary tumor sites
and to detect additional tumor involvement, we have performed in 22 patients with
MTC either 99mTc(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and/or
111In-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-D-Phe-1-octreotide scintigraphy.
RESULTS: Indium-111-octreotide (150-200 MBq) identified the primary tumor in 10
of 14 patients (71%), whereas the primary tumor was visualized by 99mTc-DMSA
(300-370 MBq) in 10 of 17 patients (58%). In 8 of 22 patients (36%), lymph node
metastases were present at the time of diagnosis, as confirmed by histopathology 
and histochemistry after surgery (all <2 mm). Preoperatively, neither scan was
able to detect lymph node involvement in these patients (0/8).
CONCLUSION: Both 99mTc-DMSA and 111In-octreotide studies have similar sensitivity
to localize primary MTC; however, these scans are not able to detect small lymph 
node involvement (micrometastases) before initial surgery. Unfortunately, both
scans have no clinical implication for preoperative staging in patients with MTC.

The use of imaging studies in the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer and 
hyperparathyroidism.

James C(1), Starks M, MacGillivray DC, White J.

Author information: 
(1)Maine Medical Center, Portland, Maine, USA.

With the variety of radiopharmaceutical agents and refined imaging techniques,
thyroid and parathyroid imaging provides much valuable clinical information. The 
use of imaging is most important in the follow-up of differentiated (DTC) and
medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Patients with DTC are followed with serum
thyroidglobulin and 131I whole body scintigraphy when the serum thyroglobulin
level is elevated. When the 131I scintigram is negative, 201Tl scintigraphy may
best identify the site of recurrent DTC. Alternative radioisotopes, ultrasound,
CT, and FDG PET are also useful in localizing the site of DTC metastases. MTC
recurrences and metastases are more difficult to image. Selective venous
catheterization is the most sensitive and specific method for detecting areas of 
recurrent MTC. High-resolution ultrasound, CT, MR imaging, and scintigraphy are
all capable of, and useful in, detecting macroscopic foci of metastatic tumor.
Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and 99mTc DMSA have been the most frequently
used nuclear imaging agents in patients with recurrent MTC. Imaging for
hyperparathyroidism remains controversial. Sestambi has become the preferred
isotope for parathyroid scintigraphy; whereas high-resolution ultrasound is also 
frequently used. Preoperative imaging is being used as a method to allow a
unilateral neck exploration, more recently, in conjunction with intraoperative
1-84 PTH assay and with intraoperative use of the gamma probe. Most often,
parathyroid imaging is performed before reoperation for persistent
hyperparathyroidism.

Comment in
    Clin Radiol. 1999 Jul;54(7):486.

A system for defining renal scarring on ultrasound is proposed and compared with 
DMSA scintigraphy. Renal scarring was assessed with ultrasound in children
following urinary tract infection (UTI) using the following criteria: (1)
proximity of sinus echoes to cortical surface; (2) loss of pyramids; (3)
irregularity of outline; (4) loss of definition of capsular echo; and (5)
calyceal dilatation. Three hundred and thirty-nine consecutive ultrasound scans
(US) and DMSA scintigrams, comprising 648 kidneys, were performed and reported
blindly and the results were compared. Using DMSA scintigraphy as the gold
standard, ultrasound had a positive predictive value of 93% and a negative
predictive value of 95%. Ultrasound disagreed with DMSA scintigraphy in 5.2% of
kidneys. On review of the cases of disagreement where arbitration was possible by
comparison with other imaging, ultrasound was incorrect in 10 kidneys and DMSA
was incorrect in 13. We conclude that the sensitivity in the ultrasound detection
of renal scarring can be greatly improved using this method. If no scars were
detected at ultrasound an alternative explanation for an abnormal DMSA scintigram
should be sought.

Effects of zinc supplementation during chelating agent administration in cadmium 
intoxication in rats.

Flora SJ(1), Gubrelay U, Kannan GM, Mathur R.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Defence Research and Development
Establishment, Gwalior, India.

The concomitant administration of zinc during chelation of cadmium (Cd) with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or calcium trisodium diethylenetriamine
penta-acetic acid (DTPA) was investigated in male rats subchronically exposed to 
Cd. The results suggest that the administration of zinc alone after cadmium
exposure does not elicit any protective effects. However, when supplemented
during treatment with DTPA it produced a significant turnover in the altered
biochemical variables and a depletion of Cd concentration in liver and kidneys.
Cadmium-induced elevated hepatic metallothionein (MT) contents remained
practically unaltered on Zn-DTPA administration, but there was a significant
increase in renal MT levels compared to rats administered Cd-DTPA or Cd alone.

15-year follow-up of reflux nephropathy by imaging.

Goonasekera CD(1), Gordon I, Dillon MJ.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS
Trust, London, UK.

Reflux nephropathy i. e. renal scarring associated with vesico-ureteric reflux
and urinary tract infection is primarily a diagnosis based on renal imaging. It
is well known to be associated with hypertension and renal failure. This has led 
to regular long-term follow-up of patients, clinically and radiologically. We
report the findings of renal imaging in a cohort of 37 patients with reflux
nephropathy 15 or more years after successful surgical correction of
vesico-ureteric reflux. The degree of renal scarring had been assessed and
recorded at the beginning of the study utilizing a score on the original X-ray
films. The scar scores of the current intravenous urography (IVU) imaging
underestimate the degree of scarring in 35% of cases when compared with the
previously recorded scar scores of the original IVU images suggesting a reduction
in the renal scar score in some cases over the years. In the current review,
concomitant renal images obtained by IVU and 99mTc dimercapto succinic acid
(DMSA) scanning were in agreement for scar scoring in only 50% of cases. The
original scar score by IVU or the current scar score by either technique does not
correlate with blood pressure, urine albumin excretion or glomerular filtration
rate (GFR). We conclude that serial long-term two-dimensional renal imaging in
children with damaged kidneys who no longer have vesico-ureteric reflux, does not
provide additional information that will alter clinical management. However, the 
changes in renal volume and echogenicity were not assessed in this study.

67Ga-citrate and 99mTc(V)-DMSA images were obtained in a patient with recurrent
extraabdominal fibromatosis of the left calf. The 67Ga-citrate image showed
abnormal uptake in the left calf lesion and right calf, which was considered due 
to probable myositis caused by overexertion. On the other hand, the 99mTc(V)-DMSA
image showed abnormal uptake only in the left calf lesion. Surgical and radiation
therapy was performed. Two years after the treatment, two lesions of the
recurrent extraabdominal fibromatosis followed, and a 99mTc(V)-DMSA image could
demarcate the two lesions. 99mTc(V)-DMSA images were considered to be useful in
following up of recurrent extraabdominal fibromatosis.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL)
in infants (less than 2-years-old) and study the potential long-term renal
parenchymal damage by 99 m Tc DMSA renal scan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 1993 and February 1998, 12 children
underwent ESWL treatment for kidney and ureter urolithiasis with a Sonolith 3,000
lithotriptor (Technomed-Corp). All children were less than 2-years-old.
Evaluation of treatment and its consequences was based on clinical examination,
conventional imaging (plain abdominal radiography excretory urogram) and a DMSA
renal scan performed 24 hours before ESWL and at least 6 months after treatment.
RESULTS: Treatment was successful in 84.6% of cases, by achieving stone-free
status after one session and 100% after 2 sessions. Long-term follow-up (one
month to four years) did not reveal any blood pressure or renal function changes.
No acquired parenchymal scar was identified. On DMSA renal scan.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of ESWL in treating infant urolithiasis is clearly
established. Renal parenchymal damage associated with ESWL did not appear in this
study, but long-term follow-up mandatory (blood pressure) and each infant should 
have a DMSA renal scan before and after ESWL to confirm these preliminary results
on a larger series.

The results of serial dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) imaging over 5 years are
reported in 287 children with severe vesico-ureteral reflux entered into the
European Branch of the International Reflux Study in Children. The children were 
randomly allocated to medical (n=147) or surgical (n=140) management and DMSA
studies were performed during the follow up period at least 6 months after any
urinary tract infection. Abnormal images were classified into four types: (1)
large polar hypodensity with normal renal outline; (2) peripheral photon
deficient defect(s) in a non-deformed kidney; (3) small renal image with normal
contour; and (4) peripheral defect(s) with resultant irregularity of the renal
outline. The DMSA findings were abnormal at entry in 235 (82%) with no difference
in incidence or severity between the two treatment groups. During follow up,
deterioration was observed in 25 medically and 23 surgically treated patients and
comprised image deterioration alone in 17, image deterioration with corresponding
reduction in differential function in 16 and reduction in relative function
without image change in 15, with similar distribution between the two treatment
groups. Deterioration was more frequent in children entering the study under the 
age of 2 years and in those with grade IV rather than grade III reflux. These
findings, showing no difference in outcome between children managed surgically or
medically, are consistent with the radiological results already
published.CONCLUSION: In the International Reflux Study the DMSA scintigraphic
data showed no difference in outcome between children managed surgically or
medically.

Comparison of the effectiveness of 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BAL) and

i Virgili University, Reus, Spain.

The effectiveness of 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BAL) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) on HgCl2-induced nephrotoxicity was studied in the rat. Seven groups 
of adult male rats were given a single sc toxic dose of HgCl2 (0.68 mg/kg)
followed by 0.9% saline (positive control group), BAL (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg) or
DMSA (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) administered ip at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h thereafter. 
Although the renal function of HgCl2-exposed rats was slightly improved after BAL
administration, Hg concentrations in the kidney were only reduced at 60 mg/kg. In
addition, the protective effect of BAL was not dose-related. In contrast to BAL, 
DMSA was effective in increasing the urinary excretion of Hg and in reducing the 
renal Hg content. These results show that DMSA would be more effective than BAL
in preventing or in protecting against inorganic Hg-induced nephrotoxicity.

Renal scarring is the main long term complication of acute pyelonephritis in
children. The prevalence rate is hazardous since data from the literature are
confusing with respect to reflux nephropathy, chronic pyelonephritis and renal
hypoplasia. The pathology of such lesions consists in focal interstitial
fibrosis. When the first pyelonephritic attack occurs during infancy, renal
growth may be compromised. The current approach of renal scar assessment is based
on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Bilateral extensive lesions may be
responsible for altered glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and/or arterial
hypertension. The management of overt scarring is conservative and careful
prevention must be based on early and aggressive treatment of acute
pyelonephritis.

Pyelonephritis in children may lead to irreversible renal damage and eventually
to arterial hypertension and renal insufficiency. Inflammation plays a central
role in the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy permits detection of acute renal lesions and renal scars with high
sensitivity and specificity. In our experience 60% of patients who had acute
renal lesions on DMSA scintigraphy during pyelonephritis develop scars. Young age
appears to be not a risk factor, as in our experience 70% of children older than 
5 years develop scars compared to 40% for children younger than 1 year. In
addition, only 40% of patients who develop scars have vesicoureteral reflux. DMSA
scintigraphy may provide answers to important clinical questions: what is the
optimal length of treatment of pyelonephritis? Is parenteral treatment necessary?
What is the best treatment of vesicoureteral reflux? DMSA scintigraphy permits
therapeutical decision-making according to the renal involvement in each of our
patients.

syringes.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the adsorption behavior of 
some widely used, commercially available 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals onto
different types of plastic syringes.
METHODS: Kits were reconstituted with 99mTc-pertechnetate diluted with 0.9%
saline to produce maximum radioactive concentrations, as stated by the
manufacturers. Aliquots of the solutions were transferred to four different
brands of 2-ml syringes. The activity in the syringes was measured before and
after injections or simulated injections. The amount adsorbed to the plastic
syringe barrel and plunger before and after washout also was measured at
different time intervals. Comparisons between products from different
manufacturers were made for 99mTc succimer (DMSA) and 99mTc macroaggregated
albumin (MAA).
RESULTS: Some 99mTC preparations undergo significant adsorption to plastic
syringes. Adsorption differs considerably between products from different
manufacturers. There was significantly higher residual activity in some types of 
syringes. In some cases the residual was as high as 40%-50% of the initial
activity, and most of the adsorption occurred within 15 min of filling the
syringe.
CONCLUSION: The data suggest that the extent of adsorption depends on
pharmaceutical excipients in the kits and/or the type of syringe used. When
inappropriate syringes are used, the reduction in the administered activity may
result in poor-quality images. Therefore, the compatibility between
radiopharmaceutical and syringe should be investigated under normal conditions of
preparation and use every time a new brand of syringe or a new
radiopharmaceutical comes into use in diagnostic nuclear medicine.

1. Calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (CaNa2 EDTA) and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) individually and in
permutation-combination in various doses (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mmol/kg bodyweight)
were investigated for their efficacy to mobilize lead from vital tissues into
urine and faeces and to restore the lead-sensitive biochemical parameters in lead
pre-exposed rats with a view to develop the most acceptable treatment regimen for
lead poisoning with a minimal loss of endogenous essential elements. 2. The
combined therapy was more effective than a single chelator treatment. 3. The
combination of 0.2 mmol/kg CaNa2EDTA + 0.4 mmol/kg DMSA caused a lower depletion 
of zinc, calcium and iron but possessed almost equal capability to that of 0.4
mmol/kg CaNa2EDTA + 0.4 mmol/kg DMSA to produce urinary as well as faecal
excretion of lead, to reduce the tissue burden of lead, including that of the
brain, and to reverse lead-induced biochemical alterations. 4. The combination of
0.2 mmol/kg CaNa2EDTA + 0.4 mmol/kg DMSA has shown a definite improvement over
previously reported combinations in terms of removal of lead from tissues,
particularly the brain, restoration of urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid levels
and a decrease in the loss of body zinc and is, therefore, recommended for the
treatment of lead intoxication.

Early diagnosis of metastases of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) provides the
optimal condition for curative outcome. The aim of this study was to appraise the
detection of metastases in patients with recurrent MTC using
[111In-DTPA-d-Phe1]-pentetreotide and pentavalent technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid [99mTc(V)-DMSA] in comparison with histopathological
findings. Eighteen MTC patients with persistently elevated tumour marker
(calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen) levels underwent somatostatin receptor
scintigraphy using [111In-DTPA-d-Phe1]-pentetreotide (222 MBq) with early (4 h
after injection) and delayed (24 h) whole-body scans and single-photon emission
tomography (SPET) imaging. Metabolic whole-body and SPET imaging using 500 MBq
99mTc(V)-DMSA was performed 4 h after injection. Metabolic and receptor imaging
revealed 51 sites of focal accumulation in the 18 patients investigated.
Comparison with histological findings revealed that metabolic and receptor
imaging had a sensitivity of 84% for the diagnosis of MTC. Using
[111In-DTPA-d-Phe1]-pentetreotide, SPET discovered four lymph node metastases in 
two patients in whom planar views had previously identified only one lymph node
metastasis, and provided no new information in the other 16 patients. In
comparison, SPET studies [using 99mTc(V)-DMSA] additionally localized eight lymph
node metastases in four patients and confirmed the diagnosis of hepatic
metastases (n=5) in another patient in whom conventional imaging modalities and
planar views had previously detected only three liver metastases. Overall, lesion
detection sensitivities for 99mTc(V)-DMSA and [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-pentetreotide
were 69% and 29%, respectively. Five surgically removed foci were adjudged
false-positive with respect to MTC metastases. False-positve results were caused 
by lymphadenitis, an enchondroma and a pheochromocytoma (histologically proven). 
The smallest lesion identified by metabolic imaging was a 6 mm in diameter lymph 
node metastasis located in the upper mediastinum. Somatostatin receptor
scintigraphy only demonstrated tumour sizes more than 1 cm in diameter. These
preliminary results suggest that the combination of metabolic [99mTc(V)-DMSA] and
receptor ([111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-pentetreotide) imaging is more sensitive for tumour
localization in patients with recurrent MTC than the use of only one
radiopharmaceutical. However, neither 99mTc(V)-DMSA nor
[111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-pentetreotide is specific for MTC and false-positive
scintigraphic findings have to be considered. Furthermore, somatostatin receptor 
scintigraphy cannot visualize small tumour sites (<1 cm). Further studies are
needed to evaluate the role of combined metabolic and receptor imaging in the
management of patients with recurrent MTC.

Functional dissection of the molybdate-responsive transcription regulator, ModE, 
from Escherichia coli.

Institute, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California

The product of the Escherichia coli modE gene, ModE, is a member of a unique
class of molybdate-responsive DNA binding proteins. Here we investigated the
roles of the N- and C-terminal domains of ModE in mediating DNA binding and
protein dimerization, respectively. Compared to the full-length protein, the
N-terminal half of ModE has a greatly diminished capacity to bind the modA
promoter in vitro and to repress expression from a modA-lacZ operon fusion in
vivo. Fusing a protein dimerization domain, encoded by the C terminus of lambda
CI repressor protein, to the truncated ModE protein generated a ModE-CI fusion
protein that not only displayed a greatly increased in vivo repressor activity
but could also substitute for ModE at the moaA and dmsA promoters. In the
reciprocal experiment, we restored repressor activity to a truncated CI protein
by addition of the C-terminal domain of ModE, which is comprised of two MopI-like
subdomains. By an in vivo competition assay, we also demonstrated that the
CI-ModE chimeric protein retained the ability to interact with wild-type ModE.
Finally, specific deletions within the ModE portion of the CI-ModE protein
chimera abolished both in vivo repression and the ability to interact with
wild-type ModE. Together, these data demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of
ModE is sufficient to mediate DNA binding, although efficient binding requires
that ModE form a dimer, a function that is supplied by the C-terminal MopI-like
subdomains.

Efficacy of succimer chelation for reducing brain Pb levels in a rodent model.

Smith D(1), Bayer L, Strupp BJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Environmental Toxicology, University of California, Santa Cruz
95064, USA.

Increasing evidence indicates that early low-level lead (Pb) exposure produces
enduring cognitive impairment in children, underscoring the need to develop
improved therapeutic intervention. Although chelating agents have been shown to
effectively reduce body Pb levels, it is not yet known whether this treatment
ameliorates Pb-induced cognitive dysfunction. Clinical research in this area is
hampered by the need to rely on reductions in blood Pb levels as the index of
treatment efficacy, despite the fact that brain Pb level is the exposure
parameter of greatest relevance to neurocognitive outcomes. The present studies
were designed to provide information that will aid future research in this area
in both human and animal models. The objectives of these studies were (1) to
evaluate the efficacy of different doses and durations of succimer
(meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid; DMSA) chelation for reducing brain and blood
Pb levels and (2) to determine the extent to which blood Pb can serve as a
surrogate of brain Pb following chelation. Long-Evans hooded rats were exposed to
Pb from birth until day 31 (Study 1) or day 40 (Study 2) of life, followed by
oral treatment with a vehicle or one of two succimer regimens for a duration of
either 7 or 21 days. Results indicated that 7 days of succimer treatment produced
a 1.5- to 2.5-fold greater reduction of Pb in blood than in brain, relative to
time-matched vehicle groups. Prolonged treatment (21) days did not further reduce
blood Pb levels (relative to 7-day succimer treatment), but did produce further
reductions in brain Pb level compared to time-matched vehicle groups. Thus,
chelation-mediated reductions in brain Pb did not parallel reductions in blood Pb
over the course of treatment. While the relevance of these data to humans may be 
confounded by anatomical and physiological differences between rodents and
primates, as well as differences in the metabolism of succimer (DMSA), they
suggest that clinical studies should exercise caution when using blood Pb as an
index of the efficacy of chelation treatment for reducing brain Pb levels.

Technetium-99m (V) dimercaptosuccinic acid uptake by choroidal melanoma before
and after iodine-125 brachytherapy.

Kiratli H(1), Kiratli PO, Ercan MT, Bilgiç S.

Author information:

Türkiye.

PURPOSE: The value of the new tumour-seeking agent technetium-99m (V)
dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc (V) DMSA), is assessed by the visualization of
choroidal melanoma before and after iodine-125 episcleral plaque brachytherapy.
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 12 consecutive patients with
choroidal melanoma that was to be treated with plaque brachytherapy. The
pre-operative mean (+/- SD) maximal tumour basal diameter was 12.9+/-2.9 mm and
the mean tumour height was 8.2+/-2.9 mm. Each patient had planar scintigraphy and
single-photon emission computed tomography using 99mTc (V) DMSA 2 days before
treatment and 8 months following plaque removal. The calculated tumour to
background ratios of these two tests were compared.
RESULTS: The pre-operative tumour to background ratio was 1.8+/-0.4 and all
tumours could be correctly identified. At the time of postoperative imaging, all 
melanomas showed varying degrees of regression. The mean tumour height was
4.4+/-2.1 mm. The tumour to background ratio was 1.4+/-0.3. The difference
between the two scintigraphic results was statistically significant (P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Technetium-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy can accurately detect choroidal
melanoma and document tumour response following episcleral radioactive plaque
therapy. As such, this test can be an alternative ancillary investigative tool in
the rare event of opaque media or diagnostic uncertainty.

Variability in the interpretation of dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy after
urinary tract infection in children.

Children's Hospital, University of Sydney, Australia.

Technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy is a frequently used
diagnostic test in pediatric practice to assess the presence and severity of
renal damage. Most commonly it is performed after urinary tract infection. The
aim of this study was to investigate the variability in the interpretation of
DMSA scans by pediatric nuclear medicine physicians in this clinical
setting.METHODS: We selected all 441 scans from children with first-time urinary 
tract infection who presented between 1993 and 1995 to a pediatric casualty
department and who are participants in a prospective cohort study. Two hundred
and ninety-four scans were performed at a median time of 7 days after diagnosis, 
and 147 scans were from children who were free from further infection over a 1-yr
follow-up period. Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians independently
interpreted the 441 scans according to whether renal damage was present or absent
and using the modified 4-level grading system for DMSA abnormality of Goldraich. 
Apart from being informed that urinary tract infection was the indication for
DMSA scintigraphy, no other clinical information was given to the nuclear
medicine physicians. The indices of variability used were the percentage of
agreement and the kappa statistic. For the grading scale used, both measures were
weighted with integers representing the number of categories from perfect
agreement. Disagreement was analyzed for children, kidneys and kidney zones.
RESULTS: There was agreement in 86% (kappa = 69%) for the normal-abnormal DMSA
scan dichotomy, and the weighted agreement was 94% (weighted kappa = 82%) for the
grading of abnormality. Disagreement of DMSA scan interpretation of > or =2
grades was present in three cases (0.7%). The same high level of agreement was
present for patient, kidney and kidney zone comparisons. Agreement was not
influenced by age or timing of scintigraphy after urinary tract infection.
CONCLUSION: Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians showed good agreement in 
the interpretation of DMSA scintigraphy in children after urinary tract infection
and using the grading system of Goldraich.

Assessment of infective urinary tract disorders.

Sixt R(1), Stokland E.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Clinical Physiology, Sahlgrenska University
Hospital/Ostra, Göteborg, Sweden.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children, particularly in the youngest
age groups. There is a risk for progressive deterioration of renal function in
these children if aggravating factors such as gross reflux and/or outflow
obstruction of the urinary tract are present. In this review the pros and cons of
available scintigraphic and radiological imaging techniques for the work-up of
these children are presented. Ultrasound can be used in the acute phase to
exclude obstruction but can not reliably show transient or permanent parenchymal 
lesions. The presence of reflux can be established with X-ray or direct nuclide
cystography. The X-ray technique gives good morphological information and has a
grading system with prognostic relevance. Both techniques are invasive and great 
care must be taken to keep the radiation burden down with the X-ray technique.
Indirect nuclide cystography following a renographic study is non-invasive but
has a lower sensitivity than direct techniques. More experience is needed with
the indirect technique to evaluate the consequences of its apparently low
sensitivity. Urography has a limited place in the acute work-up of urinary tract 
infection but can be used to look for renal scarring 1-2 years after an acute
pyelonephritis. The 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan can be used during 
the acute UTI to show pyelonephritic lesions with good accuracy and/or during the
follow-up after six months to show permanent lesions. The acute DMSA scan can be 
omitted. An early treatment is more important than an early scan!

Evaluation of DMSA scintigraphy and urography in assessing both acute and
permanent renal damage in children.

Stokland E(1), Hellström M, Jacobsson B, Jodal U, Sixt R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Radiology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Göteborg, 
Sweden.

PURPOSE: To evaluate dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy and urography in
the detection of renal involvement in children with urinary tract infection (UTI)
in order to identify patients with a high risk of developing renal damage.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 157 children (median age 0.4 years, range 5 days
to 5.8 years) with first-time symptomatic UTI were examined scintigraphy (with an
assessment of renal area involvement) and urography at the time of UTI and 1 year
later. All evaluations were made blindly.
RESULTS: Of the total 314 kidneys, 80 (25%) were abnormal at initial
scintigraphy. Of these 80 kidneys, 44 (55%) had normalized at follow-up. Of the
234 initially normal kidneys, 29 (12%) were abnormal at follow-up. One year after
UTI, abnormalities were seen in 59 children at scintigraphy and in 18 children at
urography. Renal area involvement was larger and split function abnormalities
more common in kidneys that were abnormal at both scintigraphy and urography than
in kidneys with only scintigraphic abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: Quantitation of renal area involvement and split renal function at
early scintigraphy would seem to be useful in identifying patients at risk of
developing renal damage. Urography at 1 year after infection identified mainly
those with the most severe scintigraphic abnormalities. The clinical importance
of scintigraphic abnormalities that are not confirmed by urography is not known.

The usefulness of Tc-99m DMSA SPECT and three-dimensional surface rendering in an
asymptomatic patient with a single kidney in the pelvis.

THOMAS.LEITHA@akh-wien.ac.at

The diagnostic problems in a clinically asymptomatic patient with a previously
unknown ectopic single kidney in the pelvis and the diagnostic utility of
three-dimensional surface rendering of Tc-99m DMSA SPECT for delineating ectopic 
functional renal parenchyma are reported. Inconclusive dynamic planar Tc-99m MAG3
renal scintigraphy was performed with the field of view centered at the upper
abdomen. Twenty-four hours later, static planar Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy 3 hours 
after injection delineated functional renal parenchyma only in the pelvis but did
not reveal the shape of the organ. Three-dimensional surface rendering exposed a 
single ectopic kidney in the pelvis. This case is the first description of the
advantages of three-dimensional surface rendering of Tc-99m SPECT in the
diagnosis of an ectopic kidney.

Visualization of orbital retinoblastoma with technetium-99m (V)
dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Ankara, Turkey.

The potential contributions of technetium-99m (V) dimercaptosuccinic acid
scintigraphy in the evaluation of orbital retinoblastoma, its local extensions
and metastases were assessed in this study. Both planar and SPECT images clearly 
demonstrated the primary tumor and metastatic sites. Following confirmation of
our results by contemporaneous ultrasonography, MRI and a subsequent incisional
biopsy, the patient was treated with external beam radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
This preliminary study showed that in combination with other diagnostic tests,
Tc-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy may play a role in the detection and follow-up of
the local tumor extensions and metastases in patients with retinoblastoma.

Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy studies of renal cortical
scarring and renal length.

Rossleigh MA(1), Farnsworth RH, Leighton DM, Yong JL, Rose M, Christian CL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick NSW,
Sydney, Australia.

The aims of this study were to validate 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy appearances with histopathological features of scarring; to evaluate
the sensitivity and specificity of 99mTc-DMSA and ultrasound for the detection of
renal scarring; to compare planar, pinhole and SPECT techniques when using
99mTc-DMSA; and to compare 99mTc-DMSA and ultrasound renal length
measurement.METHODS: Reflux nephropathy was induced in large white pigs using
established methods. To ensure that the abnormalities detected were scars and not
inflammatory changes, the pigs were not studied until 3 mo after the treated
episode of acute pyelonephritis confirmed by 99mTc-DMSA.
RESULTS: Twenty pigs were enrolled in the study. Eleven reached the end point,
but only nine pigs (18 kidneys) were available for analysis. Thirty-four scars
were identified pathologically; 24 were present macroscopically and a further 10 
were seen only on microscopy. Technetium-99m-DMSA abnormalities correlated with
scars histopathologically with an accuracy of 92% versus that of ultrasound, 75% 
(p < 0.001). Technetium-99m-DMSA more accurately identified scarring with a
higher sensitivity (76% versus 29%) and specificity (98% versus 92%) than
ultrasound. On the 99mTc-DMSA study, pinhole imaging had the highest accuracy
(92%) when compared with planar (90%) and SPECT (87%) data. These differences
were not statistically significant. Renal lengths as measured on 99mTc-DMSA more 
closely correlated with length measurement at pathological examination than
ultrasound. Technetium-99m-DMSA measurement was, on average, 6% higher than
pathology, and ultrasound was, on average, 22% lower.
CONCLUSION: Technetium-99m-DMSA appears to be the preferred method for the
detection of renal cortical scarring and accurate renal length measurement when
compared with ultrasound examination.

Center, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.

Previous studies of the intraoperative use of a handheld gamma probe to localize 
metastases and primary tumors of colorectal cancer have shown improved assessment
of tumor spread and changes in surgical management based on added information
gained by radioimmunoguided surgery. We conducted a prospective study to
determine whether intraoperative radiodetection is able to reveal microscopic and
occult disease of neuroendocrine tumors [medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs),
gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) tumors].METHODS: After the injection of 180 MBq
[111In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-D-Phe1]pentetreotide and/or 500 
MBq 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) (both for double-nuclide scintigraphy), 
preoperative somatostatin receptor imaging (12 patients with GEP tumors) and
double-nuclide scintigraphy (10 patients with relapsing MTCs were performed. The 
results were combined with the information obtained from conventional imaging
modalities (CT and sonography). Intraoperative radiodetection was performed 24 hr
after administration of [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]pentetreotide or 4 hr after the
injection of 99mTc-DMSA using a handheld gamma probe.
RESULTS: Intraoperative gamma counting localized 70 somatostatin
receptor-positive lesions of GEP tumors, whereas preoperative receptor imaging
visualized 74%, surgical palpation visualized 44% and radiological imaging
modalities localized only 43%. In 10 patients with recurrent MTCs, the surgeon
was successful in localizing and removing 30 tumor lesions using the gamma probe.
Twenty-seven of 30 lesions demonstrated tumor involvement, whereas 3 lesions were
false-positive (lymphadenitis). Double-nuclide scintigraphy revealed 67%
(Octreoscan, 7 of 20; 99mTc-DMSA, 13 of 20), surgical palpation revealed 60% and 
conventional imaging methods (CT, sonography) revealed only 50% of all lesions
detected intraoperatively by the handheld gamma probe. The smallest lesion
identified by the handheld probe (not palpated by the surgeon) was a lymph node
metastasis (5-mm diameter).
CONCLUSION: The preliminary data show that intraoperative handheld gamma probe
detection of microscopic and occult endocrine tumors is feasible and more
sensitive than external scintigraphy and conventional imaging.

Soluble interleukin-2 receptor in children with reflux nephropathy.

Konda R(1), Sakai K, Ota S, Takeda A, Chida N, Sato H, Orikasa S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.

PURPOSE: Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor level is a sensitive and
quantitative marker of lymphocyte activation. We determined levels of serum
soluble interleukin-2 receptor in children with reflux nephropathy to evaluate
its clinical significance in the prediction for the progression of renal
injuries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor values were
determined in 63 children with reflux nephropathy. The group consisted of 37 boys
and 26 girls 10 to 18 years old. T cells (naive and memory), B cells and
macrophages were evaluated immunohistochemically in the scarred kidneys of 4
other patients (3 boys and 1 girl 5 to 16 years old) who underwent nephrectomy
due to severe reflux nephropathy with little function seen on
(99m)technetium-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) renal scan. Levels of serum
soluble interleukin-2 receptor were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay. We simultaneously determined serum levels of creatinine and
beta2-microglobulin, and urinary levels of alpha1-microglobulin and microalbumin.
Individual functions of the right and left kidneys were estimated by renal
dimercaptosuccinic acid uptake.
RESULTS: Levels of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor in the patients who had
low total uptake of DMSA (right uptake plus left uptake) were significantly
higher than those from patients with normal total uptake. Levels of serum soluble
interleukin-2 receptor correlated significantly with levels of creatinine
(r=0.616, p <0.0001) and beta2-microglobulin (r=0.803, p <0.0001), and levels of 
urinary alpha1-microglobulin (r=0.753, p <0.0001) and microalbumin (r=0.673, p
<0.0001). A significant negative correlation was observed between levels of serum
soluble interleukin-2 receptor and total DMSA uptake values (right uptake plus
left uptake r=-0.678, p <0.0001). In the scarred kidneys leukocyte infiltrates
were markedly increased in fibrosed spaces. The predominant cell type in these
lesions was memory T cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that elevated levels of serum soluble
interleukin-2 receptor are likely to reflect activated T cells in the kidneys of 
patients with reflux nephropathy and may be a useful predictor of progression of 
renal injury in these children.

99mTechnetium-dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan in the evaluation of potential 
long-term renal parenchymal damage associated with extracorporeal shock wave
lithotripsy in children.

Lottmann HB(1), Archambaud F, Hellal B, Pageyral BM, Cendron M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Urology, Hôpital St. Joseph, Paris, France.

PURPOSE: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) has been reported as
efficient and safe in children. Because of reports of renal parenchymal damage in
adults, this study was designed to assess the effects of ESWL in pediatric
kidneys evaluated before and after treatment with (99m)technetium
dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) renal scan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 15 children, 9 months to 15 years old (mean age
6.5 years), underwent ESWL treatment for urolithiasis. Evaluation imaging
included plain abdominal radiography, excretory urogram and/or renal sonography. 
DMSA renal scan was performed 24 hours before ESWL and at least 6 months after
treatment.
RESULTS: ESWL was performed in 1 session for 8 patients, 2 sessions for 6 and 3
sessions for 1, delivering a range of 600 to 3,000 shock waves per session.
Treatment was successful in achieving stone-free status in 87% of the cases.
Long-term followup (1 to 5 years) showed no blood pressure changes. On DMSA renal
scan no acquired parenchymal scar was identified at least 6 months after ESWL
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of ESWL in treating pediatric urolithiasis is
confirmed. Renal parenchymal trauma associated with ESWL does not appear to cause
long-term lesions identifiable by DMSA renal scan.

Clinical curative effects of dimercaptosuccinic acid on hepatolenticular
degeneration and the impact of DMSA on biliary trace elements.

Ren M(1), Yang R.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Neurology, Affiliated Hospital of Anhui TCM College, Hefei,
China.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the biliary copper content of nonhepatolenticular
degeneration (HLD) controls and changes in the trace elements in the bile,
cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine of hepatolenticular degeneration patients
before and after dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) treatment in order to further
explore the etiological mechanism of HLD and prove the therapeutic effect of DMSA
on HLD patients.
METHODS: A consecutive series of 20 patients with HLD were given DMSA orally for 
4 weeks. Adult dosage was 1.5 g/day and child dosage 1.0 g/day. Their bile,
cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine samples were obtained before and after
treatment with DMSA through duodenal drainage and lumbar puncture. Biliary
samples of 22 non-HLD controls were taken by drainage tube after surgical
operation. Hitachi-208 atom absorption spectrophotometer was used to assay the
content of copper, zinc and iron of each sample.
RESULTS: DMSA could effectively improve the symptoms such as dysphasia,
salivation, dysphagia and darkening of the skin; limb trembling and myotonia came
second; but it showed no obvious effect on dysstasia, limb contracture and
deformity, and hepatosplenomegaly. It was effective for the patients who were
younger and had no obvious hepatic damage. No serious side effects were seen
through the course of treatment. Laboratory study showed that biliary copper
content of HLD patients was evidently lower than that of non-HLD controls (P <
0.01); DMSA could evidently improve biliary copper excretion besides clearly
increase urinary copper excretion (P < 0.01) and had nothing to do with biliary
zinc excretion (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Biliary copper excretion disturbance participates directly in the
pathophysiology of copper retention of HLD patients. DMSA is a favorable
cupruretic drug for patients with HLD.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), a non-toxic, water-soluble treatment for heavy
metal toxicity.

Heavy metals are, unfortunately, present in the air, water, and food supply.
Cases of severe acute lead, mercury, arsenic, and cadmium poisoning are rare;
however, when they do occur an effective, non-toxic treatment is essential. In
addition, chronic, low-level exposure to lead in the soil and in residues of
lead-based paint, to mercury in the atmosphere, in dental amalgams and in
seafood, and to cadmium and arsenic in the environment and in cigarette smoke is 
much more common than acute exposure. Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is 
a sulfhydryl-containing, water-soluble, non-toxic, orally-administered metal
chelator which has been in use as an antidote to heavy metal toxicity since the
1950s. More recent clinical use and research substantiates this compound s
efficacy and safety, and establishes it as the premier metal chelation compound, 
based on oral dosing, urinary excretion, and its safety characteristics compared 
to other chelating substances.

Asymptomatic vesicoureteral reflux detected by neonatal ultrasonographic
screening.

Comment in
    Pediatr Nephrol. 1999 Jun;13(5):462-3.
    Pediatr Nephrol. 1999 May;13(4):365.

Renal ultrasonography was performed in 2,384 healthy and asymptomatic neonates.
The definition and grading of hydronephrosis was according to the system of the
Society for Fetal Urology. Voiding cystourethrography was performed in the cases 
with moderate to severe hydronephrosis or persistent mild hydronephrosis. In
cases with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), a dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal
scan was arranged immediately to evaluate the renal parenchyma. VUR was diagnosed
in 30 infants with a prevalence of 1.26%; 7 had bilateral VUR. The male/female
ratio was 4:1 and the right/left ratio was 1.85:1. Comparing with the abnormal
ultrasonographic findings, VUR appeared ipsilaterally in 23 ureters and
contralaterally in 14 ureters. Using ultrasonography for diagnosing VUR, the
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive
value were 62.2%, 36.1%, 11.0%, and 88.2%, respectively. DMSA renal scan was
performed in 31 refluxing kidneys, and congenital renal scarring was found in 9
(29.0%) kidneys. Six neonates underwent reimplantation surgery. We conclude that 
although ultrasonography is not a reliable tool for diagnosing VUR, it can detect
many cases of VUR during the newborn stage using our screening program, which
thus makes early treatment from the neonatal period possible. Whether our
screening program can improve the outcome of VUR will require further follow-up.

[Urethrocystography in children. Practical considerations of irradiation doses].

[Article in Spanish]

Cruz Díaz MA, García Frías E.

Author information:

Henares.

OBJECTIVE: Rational use of voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is imperative, as it
is an invasive procedure exposing the child to ionizing radiation and other well 
documented risks. The objective of this study was to contribute to the
achievement of a reduction in the irradiation dose in VCUG.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of a consecutive sample of 
125 children that underwent VCUG in our hospital between January 1995 and June
1996.
RESULTS: Of the 125 VCUGs, 100 were normal, 13 showed vesicoureteric reflux grade
II or higher, and 12 of them presented with other anomalies. The indication for
VCUG was febrile UTI in 54 children, hydronephrosis detected prenatally in 12 and
other causes in 60 children. It is important to note that children with
vesicoureteric reflux presented as febrile UTI or fetal hydronephrosis. The age
was significantly lower in the reflux group (p < 0.01). Eleven of the 13 children
with vesicoureteric reflux were less than one year of age. Ultrasound anomalies
and renal scarring in Tc99 DMSA were seen in a larger proportion in the reflux
group. Preliminary X-rays showed anomalies in only 3 of 125 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: 1) Vesicoureteric reflux is related to febrile UTI and fetal
hydronephrosis. The other indications are questionable. 2) VCGU is not
recommended following the first UTI in the evaluation of children 6 years of age 
or older who have a normal ultrasound and Tc99 DMSA. 3) VCUG could be substituted
by a nuclear cystogram in girls who do not have a history of voiding dysfunction.
4) A preliminary X-ray is not justified.

Optimizing background correction when calculating differential renal function in 
the presence of hydroureteronephrosis using 99Tc(m)-DTPA.

Van de Wiele C(1), De Sadeleer C, Koole M, D'Asseler Y, Everaert K, Dierckx RA.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Gent, Belgium.

We performed a prospective study to establish the optimal background correction
algorithm for the determination of differential renal function (DRF), using
99Tc(m)-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (99Tc(m)-DTPA) in the presence of
unilateral hydronephrosis, with 24 h 99Tc(m)-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99Tc(m)-DMSA) uptake as the 'gold standard'. From September 1996 to June 1997,
12 males and 4 females (mean age 10 years, range 1 month to 72 years), presenting
with unilateral hydronephrosis, were studied. All patients underwent both DTPA
renography and quantitative DMSA scintigraphy within 24 h. In all patients, using
a surface method, the DRF of the obstructed kidney was determined using
infrarenal, suprarenal and perirenal background correction, time intervals of
60-180 s (t1), 120-180 s (t2) and 80-140 s (t3), and the application or
non-application of a Rutland-Patlak correction (RPC). In the absence of RPC, for 
all three types of background correction, no difference in DTPA DRF for any of
the three time intervals was noted; higher DTPA DRF values were found (mean +/-
S.D.: overestimates of 7.8+/-24.4%, 6.5+/-9.5% and 3.3+/-14.9% for suprarenal,
infrarenal and perirenal background correction, respectively). Application of RPC
resulted in an overall decrease in both the mean and standard deviation values,
which was most pronounced with infrarenal background correction: -0.38+/-6.5% for
t1, 0.31+/-6.3% for t2 and -1.3 +/-6.9% for t3 (t1 vs t2, P = 0.06; t3 vs t1 or
t2, P = 0.04). Our results suggest that infrarenal background correction using t1
or t2 and RPC is the best algorithm for DRF estimation using 99Tc(m)-DTPA
renography.

Pentavalent rhenium-188 dimercaptosuccinic acid for targeted radiotherapy:
synthesis and preliminary animal and human studies.

Blower PJ(1), Lam AS, O'Doherty MJ, Kettle AG, Coakley AJ, Knapp FF Jr.

Author information: 
(1)Nuclear Medicine Department, Kent and Canterbury Hospital, Canterbury, UK.

Pentavalent rhenium-188 dimercaptosuccinic acid [188Re(V)DMSA] is a beta-emitting
analogue of 99mTc(V)DMSA, a tracer that is taken up in a variety of tumours and
bone metastases. The aim of this study was to develop the kit-based synthesis of 
the agent on a therapeutic scale, to assess its stability in vivo, and to obtain 
preliminary biodistribution and dosimetry estimates, prior to evaluation of its
potential as a targeted radiotherapy agent. The organ distribution of 188Re in
mice was determined 2 h after injection of 3 MBq 188Re(V)DMSA prepared from
eluate from a 188W/188Re generator. Three patients with cancer of the prostate
and three with cancer of the bronchus, all with bone metastases confirmed with a 
standard 99mTc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (99mTc-HDP) scan, were given 370
MBq 188Re(V)DMSA and imaged at 3 h and 24 h using the 155-keV gamma-photon (15%).
Blood and urine samples were collected to determine clearance and to analyse the 
speciation of 188Re. Organ residence times were estimated from the scans, and
used to estimate radiation doses using MIRDOSE 3. In mice, 188Re(V)DMSA was
selective for bone and kidney. In patients, it showed selectivity for bone
metastases (particularly those from prostate carcinoma) and kidney, but uptake in
normal bone was not significantly greater than in surrounding soft tissues. Of
the normal tissues the kidneys received the highest radiation dose (0.5-1.3
mGy/MBq). The images were strongly reminiscent of 99mTc(V)DMSA scans in similar
patients. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of blood and urine
showed no evidence of 188Re in any chemical form other than 188Re(V)DMSA up to 24
h. In conclusion, 188Re(V)DMSA and its 186Re analogue warrant further clinical
assessment as generator/kit-derived agents for treatment of painful bone
metastases. These agents should also be assessed in medullary thyroid carcinoma
and other soft tissue tumours which have been shown to accumulate 99mTc(V)DMSA.

Lead poisoning from an unexpected source in a 4-month-old infant.

Shannon M(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Childhood lead poisoning is characteristically a disease that occurs between the 
second and third years of life, generally resulting from the child's ingestion of
lead-based paint or dust. However, lead poisoning may also appear in the first
year of life. The case of a 4-month-old infant is reported in which the
preparation of infant formula in a lead-soldered samovar (urn) resulted in venous
blood lead levels as high as 46 microg/dl. The samovar had been brought into the 
United States by the parents while on a visit to Iran. The infant was placed on
chelation therapy with parenteral CaNa2EDTA followed by oral
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and d-penicillamine. This resulted in a
rapid and substantial reduction in the blood lead level. Lead poisoning in
infancy may have unusual etiologies such as in utero transmission of lead by
lead-poisoned women. Because sources of lead poisoning in infancy may be unusual,
a detailed environmental investigation may be necessary to identify the exact
source. Children exposed to lead in the first 2 years of life have a special
vulnerability to the neurotoxicity of lead, with the risk of enduring
developmental handicaps. Continued public health initiatives to remove lead from 
the environment, in conjunction with routine lead screening of young children,
will be key in meeting the goal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
to eliminate childhood lead poisoning by the year 2011.

Comparison of radiation dose from intravenous urography and 99Tcm DMSA
scintigraphy in children.

Smith T(1), Gordon I, Kelly JP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, 
London, UK.

Intravenous urography (i.v.u.) and 99Tcm DMSA scintigraphy are possible
alternative diagnostic techniques in paediatric renal investigation. Radiation
dose comparisons between them have been complicated in the past by the lack of
paediatric data. In this study, evaluations relevant to children are used to
compare estimates of effective dose from the two techniques. For the radiographic
procedures, standard operating parameters and representative age-dependent values
of entrance surface dose were established from recent literature. Conversion
factors relating effective dose to entrance surface dose and dose-area product
are presented and used to obtain values of effective dose for single radiographs 
of abdomen, kidneys and pelvis. Suggested i.v.u. procedures consisting of four
("minimum") or eight ("average") radiographs were adopted to derive the effective
dose for full i.v.u. examinations. 99Tcm DMSA dose estimates, taken from our
published work using an administered activity schedule based on body surface
area, are almost constant at about 1 mSv for all children. In comparison, mean
i.v.u. doses based on the "average" number of radiographs are similar to DMSA
doses for infants (< 1 year) but may be twice as high for older children.
Although the differences between procedures at this level of dose do not in
themselves provide grounds for preference, when coupled with the lower diagnostic
sensitivity of i.v.u. they suggest limitations of this procedure for detection of
a renal scar.

Serum vitamin A and beta-carotene concentrations and renal scarring in urinary
tract infections.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatrics, Dokuz Eylül University, Medical Faculty, Inciralti,
Izmir, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of vitamin A on renal scarring in recurrent
urinary tract infections (UTIs).
DESIGN: Twenty three children with UTIs and renal scarring (mean (SD) age 7.3
(3.9) years) and 91 children without renal scarring (6.4 (3.4) years) were
studied. All the children had serum vitamin A and beta-carotene measurements and 
nutritional evaluation. Renal scarring was assessed by technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc DMSA) scanning. Nutritional status of all the
patients was within normal limits and not different between the groups.
RESULTS: Mean (SD) serum vitamin A and beta-carotene concentrations were not
significantly different between the patients with and without renal scarring
(vitamin A 53.2 (22.6)/46.8 (17.0) micrograms/dl and beta-carotene 232.3
(201.3)/272.4 (86.0) micrograms/dl respectively). However, when the patients with
renal scarring and with greater than 10% difference among the DMSA uptakes of
their kidneys (11 cases) were evaluated, a significant negative correlation was
determined between the serum vitamin A concentrations and the magnitude of the
difference in uptakes of each kidney. The same relation was not true for serum
beta-carotene concentrations.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a relation between serum vitamin A
concentrations and magnitude of hypoactivity in 99mTc DMSA scanning in kidneys
with advanced scarring.

Author information:

Methylene blue (MB) alone, MB metabolites in the urine and the effect of MB plus 
alkalization on Candida species were determined. MB was used for the treatment of
childhood renal candidiasis (CRC) in 3 patients as an irrigating solution.
Besides irrigation, fluconazole 3 mg/kg/day intravenously and MB 0.2 mg/kg/day
were administered perorally. Urine cultures were cleared of Candida. DMSA scans
obtained after 6 months showed no evidence of scarring. MB can be used for
irrigation of the urinary tract, with fewer side effects than amphotericin B
(AB). Additionally we advocate the use of ureteral catheters instead of
nephrostomy in the treatment of CRC.

Congenital arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the kidney is a rare condition.
Rupture of an AVM in the kidney may cause hematuria, flank pain, and urinary
retention due to clots. We report 2 cases of congenital renal AVM. Both were
treated with transcatheter renal arterial embolization. The signs and symptoms
disappeared after embolization. On follow-up, renal function testing with a DMSA 
scan revealed only focal loss of renal cortical function. The clinical courses of
2 cases are reported and the literature is reviewed.

Symptomatic urinary tract infection in preschool Australian children.

Craig JC(1), Irwig LM, Knight JF, Sureshkumar P, Roy LP.

Author information: 
(1)Centre for Kidney Research, Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Sydney,
Australia.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographic and clinical features, short-term
outcomes, microbiology and renal tract abnormalities of a cohort of young
Australian children with symptomatic urinary tract infection.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 304 children < 5 years with their first documented
symptomatic urinary tract infection who presented consecutively to the Emergency 
Department of a paediatric hospital between March 1993 and December 1994 and
without a known predisposing cause were identified and details of their acute
illness were recorded. Renal tract sonography, micturating cystourethrography and
Tc-99 m dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) were routinely performed.
RESULTS: Of those who presented with urinary tract infection, 169 were boys and
135 girls; 64% were less than 1 year of age. For children from the local
community, the cumulative incidence of urinary tract infection within the first 5
years of life was estimated to be 1.9% for boys and 1.8% for girls. There were no
significant differences in illness characteristics according to mode of referral 
or geographical locality. Presenting symptoms were generally nonspecific and not 
referrable to the urinary tract. There were no deaths. One per cent of children
required ventilatory support, and bacteraemia occurred in 6%, all of whom were
under 6 months of age. E. coli was the causal organism in 84%, and a high in
vitro resistance to ampicillin/ amoxycillin (54%) was demonstrated by the
pathogens isolated. Bacteriuria was eradicated in 99% with antimicrobial
treatment. In this setting, the sensitivities of dipstick urinalysis (leucocyte
esterase+/-nitrites) and pyuria on microscopy (>10 x 10(6) white cells L(-1))
were 85%. Abnormal DMSA scintigraphy was detected in 39%, vesicoureteric reflux
in 28%, and obstructive uropathy in 1%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides current and local data on a large sample of
children <5 years with urinary tract infection, which are useful to clinicians
who manage children at risk of the condition.

OBJECTIVE: Not all hospitals in our country have their own nuclear medicine
laboratory. Most small and medium size hospitals must arrange their radioisotope 
studies with private clinics. The objective of this study was to assess if a
single DMSA scan performed after an acute infection in a group of patients chosen
according to certain risk criteria would allow the selection of those who run the
risk of progressive renal damage.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive and retrospective study of the clinical
records of 65 patients under 14 years of age with urinary tract infection (UTI)
seen at our institution between 1994 and 1995 and on whom a DMSA scan had been
performed was carried out. The study groups was formed by the fifteen children
with scintigraphic findings compatible with renal scarring. The fifty children
with normal DMSA scans were used as controls.
RESULTS: Renal scarring was found more often in patients over one year of age (p 
< 0.05), in those with reinfections (p < 0.001) and in those kidneys with grade
III vesicoureteral reflux (VUR, p < 0.05). The most severe lesions, with
reduction of renal size, shape abnormalities and diminished uptake of the tracer 
were found together with VUR. The renal sonogram performed during the acute stage
of the UTI was able to detect only four of the six children most severely
affected.
CONCLUSIONS: Delaying the practice of the DMSA scan until 6 months after the last
episode of bacteriuria would allow selection of those patients at the highest
risk of progressive renal damage. This guideline would reduce scintigraphic
studies 30 to 90%, since it would avoid repeated studies in those children with
abnormal findings in the acute stage. The practice of the radioisotope study only
in a reduced subset of patients selected on the basis of risk criteria such as
recurrent UTI, VUR or suspected pyelonephritis does not allow detection of all
scars.

The current roles and controversies in imaging of the kidneys for the evaluation 
of patients with acute renal infection are reviewed. The nomenclature used in
describing the extent of the renal imaging findings in acute pyelonephritis
suggested by the Society of Uroradiology to help avoid confusion in terminology
in the past literature is briefly described. Computed tomography (CT) is superior
to urography and renal sonography for the evaluation and management of adults
with acute renal infection. [99mTc]-dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA) cortical
scintigraphy is the imaging study for the evaluation of children with acute
pyelonephritis investigated by some, although power Doppler ultrasound, and even 
CT, can be considered as a possible alternative.

Two groups of 12 human volunteers, who had been treated with colloidal bismuth
subcitrate, because of Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis, participated in 
the study. The patients received a single dose of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) or D,L-2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS) at a dose of 30
mg kg-1 in a randomized single blind study. In contrast to DMPS, increasing
concentrations of bismuth in blood were observed during the first 4 h after
intake of DMSA. In urine, both chelators induced a 50-fold increase in urinary
bismuth excretion compared with the control urines. The treatment was well
tolerated. The results indicate that both DMSA and DMPS effectively increase the 
elimination of bismuth in human urine. Consequently, both chelators may be of
benefit in the treatment of patients with bismuth intoxication.

(1)Institute of Hygiene and Environmental Medicine, Justus-Liebig-University,
Giessen, Germany.

Mammalian cell cultures were used to determine the capacity of antidotes to
modify (a) lead uptake, (b) lead toxicity and (c) lead release from cells. The
following chelating agents were tested: Na, Ca-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), nitriloacetic acid, ethylene
glycol-bis(aminoethyl)tetraacetic acid (EGTA), D,L-mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA),
meso-2,3-dimercaptopropanesuccinic acid (MSA),
D,L-2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS), penicillamine (PA),
N-acetylpenicillamine (NAPA), and diethylcarbodithioate (DDTC). The following
vitamins were tested: thiamine (B1), riboflavine (B2), pyridoxine (B6), cobalamin
(B12) and ascorbic acid (C). Inhibition of lead uptake was produced by EDTA,
EGTA, DMSA, DMPS, MSA, PA, NAPA and vitamins B1, B6 and C, vitamins B2 and B12
being ineffective. The same compounds reduced lead cytotoxicity. Interestingly
DDTC and DTPA increased lead uptake, but did not exacerbate lead toxicity.
Significant release of lead from preloaded cells was caused by DTPA, NAPA, DMPS
and PA, while the other chelators were ineffective.

The effects of meso 2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), sodium 2,
3-dimercaptopropane 1-sulfonate (DMPS) and S-adenosyl L-methionine (SAM) on the
enzymatic activities of mice were studied. The mice were given intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injections of these chelating agents (1 mmol/kg) and 3 h later the
activity of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) in the blood, and
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the liver 
and kidney were determined. The activity of blood ALAD was significantly
increased by the administration of DMSA and SAM while DMPS had only a moderate
effect. The activities of other hepatic enzymes changed little when the mice were
treated with these chelating agents, except for a significant reduction in
hepatic ALP activity following DMPS administration. Arsenic (III) administration 
markedly increased the activities of ALT and ALP in the liver and kidneys. The
changes in the enzymatic activities by treatment with arsenic were prevented by
injection of DMSA, DMPS and SAM, DMSA being the most effective. These results
indicate that DMSA, DMPS and SAM were not toxic to the liver or kidneys of mice
and that treatment with DMSA is more effective than DMPS or SAM in protecting
mice from acute hepatic or renal toxicity caused by arsenic.

Here we report an unusual case of primary systemic amyloidosis. The cutaneous
lesions were polymorphic and included involvement of both external auditory
canals. The visceral involvement was covert. Mapping of amyloid deposits was
performed using scintigraphy with technetium-99m (V) dimercaptosuccinic acid
([99mTc (V)] DMSA). Therapy with melphalan, prednisone and colchicine resulted in
considerable improvement.

188Re(V)-DMSA revisited: preparation and biodistribution of a potential
radiotherapeutic agent with low kidney uptake.

Organization, Menai, NSW.

Methods of preparation and biodistribution in mice of tin-free 99Tcm(V)-DMSA and 
188Re(V)-DMSA, a potential matching pair of radiopharmaceuticals for diagnosis
and therapy of certain cancers, are described. Preparation of tin-free
188Re(V)-DMSA (I) is based on reduction with either SO2-releasing compounds like 
Na2S2O4 (30 mg Na2S2O4, 10 mg DMSA, 1 mg L-ascorbic acid, 37 degrees C, 60 min
incubation), Na2S2O5 (as before, 70 degrees C, 15 min incubation), or HBr (0.2 ml
48% HBr, 0.2 ml 7 M HCl, 10 mg DMSA, 1 mg L-ascorbic acid, 70 degrees C, 60 min
incubation). I exhibits significantly lower kidney uptake than tin-containing
188Re(V)-DMSA (II) (2-3% and 49% injected dose per gram organ, 1 h
post-injection, respectively). HPLC profiles of I and II are similar. DMSA excess
in tin-free 188Re(V)-DMSA is not responsible for the low kidney uptake of I. High
kidney uptake of II is explained by formation of a mixed 188Re(V)-Sn-DMSA complex
in vivo. Age-linked bone uptake in mice dependent on the maturation of the bone
is demonstrated for both I and II.

Age- and sex-related 99Tcm-DMSA renal uptake at 24 h in children with a normal
scintigram.

We performed a retrospective study to determine the age- and sex-related normal
values of absolute 99Tcm-DMSA uptake at 24 h in children with normal kidneys. Of 
the 576 scintigrams performed between 1993 and 1996, 136 (272 kidneys) were
classified as 'normal' by two independent observers on the basis of the presence 
of a smooth cortical outline, the absence of cortical loss, relative uptake in
the range 45-55% and normal echographic parenchymal findings. The 136 scintigrams
were divided into eight groups based on the children's age: Group I, < 1 month (2
boys); Group II, 1-3 months (6 boys, 8 girls); Group III, 4-7 months (7 boys, 6
girls); Group IV, 8-12 months (8 boys, 8 girls); Group V, 13-24 months (14 boys, 
4 girls); Group VI, 25-36 months (6 boys, 13 girls); Group VII, 37-120 months (13
boys, 19 girls); Group VIII, 121-180 months (8 boys, 10 girls). In contrast to
the results of Morris et al. using absolute 99Tcm-DMSA uptake at 4-6 h, we found 
that combined left and right kidney uptake increased until age 8 months (Group I,
22.0 +/- 6.7%; Group II, 45.9 +/- 5.0%; Group III, 50.8 +/- 5.0%; Group IV, 56.9 
+/- 8.5%; P = 0.019), after which it reached a plateau (Group V, 55.4 +/- 7.3%;
Group VI, 60.1 +/- 7.8%; Group VII, 62.0 +/- 5.0%; Group VIII, 62.4 +/- 6.3%).
Uptake at 24 h tended to be lower in the girls than in the boys, but this
difference was not significant.

A novel and ubiquitous system for membrane targeting and secretion of
cofactor-containing proteins.

RJ.

(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

We report the identification of the proteins encoded by the mttABC operon
(formerly yigTUW), which mediate a novel Sec-independent membrane targeting and
translocation system in Escherichia coli that interacts with cofactor-containing 
redox proteins having a S/TRRXFLK "twin arginine" leader motif. A
pleiotropic-negative mutant in mttA prevents the periplasmic localization of twin
arginine redox enzymes, including nitrate reductase (NapA) and trimethylamine
N-oxide reductase (TorA). The mutation also prevents the correct localization of 
the integral membrane molybdoenzyme dimethylsulfoxide reductase (DmsABC). The
DmsA subunit has a twin arginine leader. Proteins with a Sec-dependent leader or 
which assemble spontaneously in the membrane are not affected by this mutation.
MttA, B, and C are members of a large family of related sequences extending from 
archaebacteria to higher eukaryotes.

Estimation and relevance of depth correction in paediatric renal studies.

Lythgoe MF(1), Gradwell MJ, Evans K, Gordon I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, 
London, UK.

Measurement of absolute renal function by gamma camera techniques requires
knowledge of kidney depth to correct for soft tissue attenuation, there is debate
about the need to take depth into account when only relative renal function is
estimated. The aim of this study was to derive a formula for renal depth in
children and to assess the importance of depth correction when relative renal
function is assessed with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on the gamma camera. In 
this study, kidney depths were derived from measurements on abdominal
computerised tomography (CT) images in 57 children in the supine position with
two normally located kidneys. Using best-subset regression analysis, one formula 
for both left and right kidney depth (KD, cm) was developed based on the easily
measured parameters of height (H, cm) and body weight (W, kg). The inclusion of
extra variables was found to significantly improve the model compared with a
model using weight alone (P<0.005). A second group of 19 children who underwent
technetium-99m DMSA scans, had differential function estimated from both anterior
and posterior views and the geometric mean method. The mean difference in
differential renal function calculated by the geometric mean method versus the
posterior image was only 1.2%. In conclusion, we present a new formula for the
estimation of paediatric kidney depth for the absolute quantitation of kidney
uptake. Further, for normally located kidneys it appears unnecessary to use the
geometric mean method or to correct for individual renal depth when calculating
differential function.

Pentavalent 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy and
99mTc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HMDP) bone scan were performed in one
patient with renal osteodystrophy (ROD) before and after vitamin D3 pulse
therapy. The bone scan showed diffusely increased tracer uptake in the whole
skeleton, and no change of tracer distribution was noted before or after vitamin 
D3 pulse therapy. However, 99mTc(V)-DMSA scintigraphy revealed diffusely
increased tracer uptake in the whole skeleton before therapy, and markedly
decreased tracer uptake in the bones was seen at 5 mo after therapy. Increased
uptake of 99mTc(V)-DMSA was observed at 7 mo after therapy, which reflected the
laboratory findings. Technetium-99m-(V)-DMSA scintigraphy appeared to be more
sensitive than the conventional 99mTc-HMDP bone scan in assessing the
characteristics and therapeutic effect of bone disease in ROD.

Effect of liposome-encapsulated meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid on mice exposed 
to lead through drinking water.

Misra M(1), Behari JR.

Author information: 
(1)Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, Lucknow.

Liposomes are the potent carriers of therapeutic drugs for their targeted
delivery to the intracellular sites specially when the drug is hydrophilic in
nature and is unable to cross the cell membrane. Lead, a major source of
environmental pollution, is accumulated in the body system of both animals and
humans through reticuloendothelial system, the site where liposomes also get
engulfed upon their entry into the body. In view of these considerations,
meso-2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), a potent chelating drug used in heavy
metals intoxication, specially lead, was encapsulated in small unilamellar
liposomes composed of phosphatidyl-choline and cholesterol (1:1) and used to
evaluate its efficacy in lead intoxication. DMSA either in free form or
encapsulated in liposomes was administered intravenously (2,62 mumoles/kg, three 
injections at a gap of 48 hours each, total 7.85 mumoles/kg) to mice which were
pre-fed with lead in drinking water (500 micrograms/ml) for one month. It was
found that only DMSA encapsulated in liposomes was significantly effective in
reducing the level of lead in liver, kidneys and spleen at the dose administered.
DMSA either in free form or encapsulated in liposomes also restored the
inhibition in blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (delta-ALAD) activity. 
The results suggest that liposome encapsulated DMSA may be preferred over free
DMSA for reducing the body burden of lead.

Comment in
    Br J Urol. 1998 Dec;82(6):932.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy in assessing the differential function between upper and lower
moieties of a refluxing duplex system.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1990 and 1996, 20 patients underwent lower moiety
heminephroureterectomy. All patients had their differential renal function
assessed by DMSA scintigraphy before and after surgery, the results being
assessed by comparing the predicted and actual loss of renal function.
RESULTS: The mean (SD, range) function attributed to the scarred lower moiety
(predicted loss of function) was 4.3 (4.9, 0-14)%, which compared with an actual 
mean loss of function of 6.8 (5.1, +4 to -16)%. Thus the mean (SD, range)
difference between the predicted and actual loss of renal function was -2.1 (3.2,
+4 to -8)%.
CONCLUSION: DMSA scintigraphy provides an accurate assessment of the differential
renal function between upper and lower moieties in a duplex system. The decision 
to proceed to lower moiety heminephroureterectomy can be logically based on the
information gained from DMSA scintigraphy.

Lead-induced hypertension. II. Response to sequential infusions of L-arginine,
superoxide dismutase, and nitroprusside.

Ding Y(1), Vaziri ND, Gonick HC.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, University of California at Irvine,
California 92717, USA.

Administration of 100 ppm lead acetate daily for 3 months caused hypertension in 
Sprague-Dawley rats, with reversal by treatment with 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA) (0.5% for 2 weeks). Animals from each group were infused sequentially in
30-min intervals with saline (S), L-arginine (Arg), Arg+ superoxide dismutase
(SOD), S, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Baseline mean blood pressure (MBP) was 
elevated in lead-treated animals (Pb) compared to that in controls(C), returning 
toward normal after DMSA (105 +/- 2 mmHg, C, vs 149 +/- 2, Pb, and 124 +/- 1,
DMSA, P < 0.001). Infusion of Arg caused a fall in MBP in all animals,
normalizing the MBP in Pb-treated animals. SNP caused a greater fall in MBP in
all groups of animals, normalizing the MBP in Pb. Measurement of urinary nitrite 
+ nitrate (NOx) by chemiluminescence revealed at baseline a reduced level in Pb, 
restored to normal by DMSA (6.6 +/- 1.5 nmol/min/100 g BW, C, vs 3.3 +/- 1.7, Pb,
P < 0.05, vs 5.8 +/- 2.6, DMSA, P = NS). Infusion of arginine increased urinary
NOx in all groups, but to a lesser degree in Pb and DMSA. Assay of plasma
malondialdehyde (MDA) by HPLC, as a measure of reactive oxygen species (ROS), was
elevated at baseline in Pb, reduced by DMSA (3.6 +/- 0.4 mumol/L, Pb, vs 1.9 +/- 
0.2, C, and 1.9 +/- 0.3, DMSA, P < 0.01). In the Pb group, SOD resulted in a
significant fall in MDA (2.0 +/- 0.3 mumol/L, SOD, vs 3.1 +/- 0.1, Arg, P <
0.01), but no further fall in MBP or increase in urinary NOx. Thus, hypertension 
in lead-exposed animals is related to both diminished NO and increased ROS. The
elevation in MBP can be ameliorated by additional NO through infusion of
substrate arginine or by treatment with the ROS scavenger, DMSA. Lead-exposed
animals show enhanced MBP sensitivity to the NO donors, Arg and SNP, but no
further response to SOD, despite a reduction in MDA to normal. We speculate that 
lead-induced hypertension may be caused by one species of ROS which enhances
vascular reactivity, and that provision of additional NO acts to scavenge the ROS
and/or acts directly as a vasodilator.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid distribution in renal tubular acidosis.

Green DA(1), Davies SG.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatrics, East Glamorgan General Hospital, Pontypridd, UK.

A 99Tcm dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan performed after a urinary tract
infection demonstrated an unusual pattern of isotope uptake, promoting further
investigations leading to a diagnosis of renal tubular acidosis secondary to
nephropathic cystinosis. This is known to affect isotope imaging but a unique
feature in this undiagnosed case was the uncorrected metabolic acidosis, which
had further altered the distribution of the DMSA. It is noteworthy because other 
patients referred for imaging with renal disease may also have abnormalities of
acid base balance.

[Usefulness of renal scintigraphy in the assessment of the first febrile urinary

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the findings of renal
ultrasonography and 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy in children with their first
acute febrile urinary tract infection to determine which method is better in
detecting patients at risk of renal injury or reflux.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three children between 0.2 and 12.3 years of age
with their first acute febrile urinary tract infection were studied by means of
clinical and laboratory assessment, renal ultrasonography and 99mTc-DMSA renal
scintigraphy. In 24 patients (72.7%) a voiding cystourethrography was made. The
patients were divided into two groups, those under 2 years of age (n = 14) and
those over 2 years old (n = 19).
RESULTS: Cortical scintigraphy showed renal changes in 23 patients (69.7%) and
ultrasonography showed renal changes in 2 (6.1%; p < 0.05). Children over 2 years
of age had a higher incidence of renal lesions than did younger children (84.2%
vs 50%; p < 0.05). There were no differences between girls and boys. Reflux was
demonstrated in 13 patients (54.2%). Among those kidneys which presented abnormal
cortical scintigraphy, vesicoureteral reflux was present in 76.5% of the studies.
Furthermore, of those with abnormal ultrasonography vesicoureteral reflux was
present in 17.6%.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a high incidence of renal involvement in children with
their first acute febrile urinary tract infection. The cortical scintigraphy is
more sensitive than ultrasonography in detecting renal changes. The incidence of 
vesicoureteral reflux in febrile urinary tract infection is high. When there is a
renal cortical defect the risk of reflux is higher. This suggests that cortical
scintigraphy should be added to the initial examination of children with their
first acute febrile urinary tract infection and this could be supplemented by
voiding cystourethrography alone, with ultrasonography having a secondary role.

X-ray crystallographic studies of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides dimethyl sulfoxide 
(Me2SO) reductase [Schindelin, H., Kisker, C., Hilton, J., Rajagopalan, K. V., & 
Rees, D. C. (1996) Science, 272, 1615-1620] indicated that the active site is at 
the bottom of a 25-A funnel. Substrates must travel to the bottom of the funnel
for reduction to occur. The homologous DmsA subunit of the trimeric Escherichia
coli Me2SO reductase, was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis of residues
potentially lining the bottom of the funnel, based on sequence alignment of the
E. coli and Rhodobacter Me2SO reductases. Sixteen E. coli DmsA mutants were
characterized. Mutants G167N, A178Q, Q179I and R217Q showed functional
impairment, as indicated by abnormal anaerobic growth with Me2SO as the sole
terminal acceptor, in a recombinant strain deleted for chromosomal dmsABC. The
kinetic parameters of the mutant enzymes were examined using the artificial
electron donor benzyl viologen and the quinone analogue dimethylnaphthoquinone,
with Me2SO and pyridine N-oxide as electron acceptors. Mutants A178Q and R217Q
showed dramatic alterations of their electron-acceptor Km, with values at least
35-fold less or greater than wild-type values, respectively, for Me2SO and
pyridine N-oxide. T148S showed altered kinetic parameters for pyridine N-oxide
and Me2SO, with Km and k(cat) decreasing and increasing approximately fourfold,
respectively. Other mutants showed less drastic alterations in kinetic
parameters. This analysis has identified amino acids important in substrate
binding and catalysis.

Limited value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for 
the imaging of neuroendocrine tumours.

Author information:

Scintigraphy using [111In-DTPA-d-Phe1]-pentetreotide or pentavalent
technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid [99mTc(V)-DMSA] has been shown to localize
well-differentiated and slowly growing neuroendocrine tumours, whereas increased 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake is associated with malignancy. The aim of this
study was to compare the value of fluorine-18 FDG positron emission tomography
(PET) with that of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SS-R) and
dual-radionuclide scintigraphy [SS-R and 99mTc(V)-DMSA = DNS] in detecting
malignant neuroendocrine tumours. Fifteen patients with metastasizing
gastroenteropancreatic tumours (GEP tumours; n = 7), medullary thyroid carcinomas
(MTCs; n = 8) and elevated tumour markers [GEP tumours: 5-hydroxyindoleacetic
acid, insulin; MTCs: calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)] were studied.
Prior to PET, all patients with GEP tumours underwent SS-R. DNS was performed in 
all patients with MTC. Patients had been fasting for at least 12 h and normal
glucose plasma levels were confirmed. Sixty minutes after intravenous
administration of 18F-FDG (mean: 374 MBq) whole-body PET and regional scans were 
performed. In addition, the resected tissues were prepared for
immunocytochemistry examination (cell cycle-associated Ki-67 antigen). In two
patients with less-differentiated GEP tumours associated with high proliferative 
activity and increased FDG uptake, SS-R failed to detect any lesion. In
comparison, in four patients with well-differentiated GEP tumours showing low
proliferative activity, SS-R localized four primary tumours, 22 lymph node
metastases and 18 malignant liver lesions, whereas 18F-FDG PET demonstrated
normal distribution. In one patient with a metastasizing carcinoid (medium
proliferative activity) SS-R localized multiple metastases, whereas PET
demonstrated low FDG uptake in all known metastases. In patients with recurrent
MTC and rapidly increasing CEA levels DNS detected only three lesions in two
patients, whereas PET demonstrated one pulmonary, three osseous, 20 mediastinal, 
ten locoregional, and four liver metastases in seven patients. Twenty-nine
malignant lesions were confirmed by follow-up and nine lymph node metastases
could be surgically removed. In conclusion, PET imaging of gastroenteropancreatic
tumours revealed increased glucose metabolism only in less-differentiated GEP
tumours with high proliferative activity and metastasizing MTC associated with
rapidly increasing CEA levels. Therefore, additional 18F-FDG PET should be
performed only if SS-R or DNS is negative.

Renal nuclear medicine: can it survive the millennium?

Woolfson RG, Neild GH.

Much of the progress in renal nuclear medicine has been driven by technological
development, but without rigorous assessment the value of some of these studies
has been overestimated. The only tests to achieve gold standard status are the
isotopic GFR, the DMSA renogram to detect cortical abnormalities and the
captopril renogram when used to define those hypertensive patients who will not
benefit from renovascular intervention. Consensus guidelines must be followed and
routine protocols for combination tests must be developed, but even so isotopic
renography is likely to be overtaken by competing technologies which can provide 
one test to give simultaneous information about both structure and function.

Recovery from lead induced biochemical and immunological alterations following
combined treatment with DMSA and calcium disodium EDTA in rats.

Flora GJ(1), Kumar P, Seth PK.

Author information: 
(1)Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, P.O. Box 80, Lucknow, 226 001, India.

The therapeutic potential of meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and calcium 
disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (CaNa(2)EDTA) alone or in combination
in reducing levels of lead in blood and other soft organs and reversing lead
induced biochemical and immunological alterations were investigated after chronic
low level lead exposure. Lead exposure produced a significant adverse effect on
few selected haematopoietic, nervous, testicular and immunological variables.
Conventional 5-day treatment with both DMSA and CaNa(2)EDTA individually was
effective in inducing elimination of lead but the recovery of the altered
biochemical and clinical indices was moderate. When given in combination for 5
days, (DMSA was administered orally twice daily before intraperitoneal
CaNa(2)EDTA administration) they were more effective in depleting body lead
burden and providing recoveries in the altered biochemical parameters. Along with
the rapid removal of lead from body stores after combined treatment, the
immunological variables also recovered spontaneously. However, the altered CNS
disorders remained practically unchanged following 5 days of chelation therapy.
Lead induced testicular alterations also showed some recoveries after combined
treatment. The results indicate that combined DMSA and CaNa(2)EDTA treatment
could be more beneficial than individual treatment with any of these agents.

Anaerobic regulation of the Escherichia coli dmsABC operon requires the
molybdate-responsive regulator ModE.

McNicholas PM(1), Chiang RC, Gunsalus RP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics and the Molecular Biology
Institute, University of California at Los Angeles, 90095-1489, USA.

Expression of the Escherichia coli dmsABC operon that encodes a
molybdenum-containing DMSO/TMAO reductase is increased in response to
anaerobiosis and repressed by nitrate. These changes are mediated by the
transcription factors Fnr and NarL respectively. Interestingly, modC strains that
are defective in molybdate uptake exhibit impaired anaerobic induction and no
nitrate-dependent repression of the dmsABC operon. To determine if the
molybdate-responsive transcription factor ModE is involved in this process, a set
of dmsA-lacZ operon fusions were constructed and analysed. The pattern of
dmsA-lacZ expression in response to anaerobiosis and nitrate addition was
identical in both modC and modE strains, thus suggesting a regulatory role for
ModE. In vitro studies confirmed that ModE bound the dmsA promoter at a
high-affinity site typical of other E. coli ModE operator sites. Mutations in
this site abolished ModE binding in vitro and displayed the same phenotype as a
modE mutation. In contrast to previously characterized ModE operator sites, which
either overlap or are located immediately upstream of the ModE-regulated
promoter, the ModE site is centred 52.5 bp downstream of the major dmsA
transcript start site. We identified a putative integration host factor (IHF)
binding site in the intervening sequence, and in vitro studies confirmed that IHF
bound this site with high affinity. Using himA mutants, we confirmed that IHF
plays a role in the molybdate-dependent regulation of dmsA-lacZ expression in
vivo. This study provides the first example in which ModE affects gene regulation
in concert with another transcription factor.

Pentavalent technetium-99m labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc(V)-DMSA)
scanning was performed on a 71-year-old woman with histologically confirmed
primary amyloidosis. Definite uptake of the tracer was noted in the thyroid,
liver, spleen, and kidney as well as in the heart. Three months later, she died
of heart failure, and autopsy findings demonstrated diffuse deposits of AL-type
amyloid in those organs that were consistent with the accumulation of
99mTc(V)-DMSA.

Hypoplastic dysplastic kidney with a vaginal ectopic ureter identified by
technetium-99m-DMSA scintigraphy.

Massachusetts 02115, USA.

Ectopic insertion of a ureter draining a hypoplastic dysplastic kidney is a
significant cause of urinary incontinence in girls. In this case, such a kidney
was detected with 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy but not by intravenous pyelography.
Scintigraphy facilitated further delineation of the anatomy with CT prior to
nephrectomy. Based on this case and a literature review, we suggest that
99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy be performed early when evaluating girls with urinary
incontinence.

Differential renal function measured by 99Tcm-DTPA and 99Tcm-DMSA in a complete
unilateral renal obstruction rat model.

(1)Division of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital, Gent, Belgium.

We performed a prospective study to determine whether 99Tcm-DTPA differential
renal function (DRF) in the case of acute obstruction in a unipapillary kidney
rat model shows a similar pattern of results as 99Tcm-DMSA in a multipapillary
kidney model, and to exclude recirculation or a block of tubular transport of
DMSA which might explain the discrepancy reported by Kelleher et al. In 15 male
and 4 female Wistar rats (weight 300-350 g), 99Tcm-DMSA renal uptake was measured
24 h before complete obstruction of the right ureter, which served as reference
values. Twenty-four hours after obstruction, 99Tcm-DTPA (18.5 MBq) renography and
99Tcm-DMSA (111 MBq) non-depth-corrected renal uptake measurements were performed
in the 15 male rats; in the 4 female rats, 740 MBq of 99Tcm-DMSA were injected
and absolute, non-depth-corrected renal uptake measured at 24, 48 and 72 h.
99Tcm-DMSA DRF of the right kidney ranged from 48 to 55% (mu: 51%; sigma: 2%)
before obstruction and from 14 to 35% (mu: 24%; sigma: 6%) after obstruction,
whereas 99Tcm-DTPA DRF ranged from 16 to 30% (mu: 25%; sigma: 4%). No significant
differences were found between DRF measured by 99Tcm-DMSA and 99Tcm-DTPA (P =
0.18), or between DRF of the obstructed kidney as measured by 99Tcm-DMSA at 24,
48 and 72 h (P > 0.2). Hypothetically, the discrepancy between our findings and
those of Kelleher et al. may be due to intratubular pressure. In conclusion, the 
present findings and those of Kelleher et al. suggest the differences in DRF
following complete unilateral renal obstruction, as determined by DTPA and DMSA, 
are probably species-specific. Furthermore, recirculation and block of tubular
transport are unlikely to contribute significantly to differences in DRF as
measured by the two radiopharmaceuticals.

The investigation of renovascular hypertension in children: the accuracy of
radio-isotopes in detecting renovascular disease.

Ng CS(1), de Bruyn R, Gordon I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Hospital for Sick Children, London, UK.

Renovascular disease is an important cause of hypertension in children because it
is potentially treatable by surgical or angioplasty techniques. The aim of this
study was to assess the accuracy of radio-isotopes (DMSA, DTPA and MAG3) combined
with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, in detecting
children with renovascular hypertension. We retrospectively reviewed the
ultrasound and pre- and post-captopril radionuclide studies (either DMSA and/or
DPTA and/or MAG3) of children with sustained hypertension investigated at our
institution. Renal angiography was used as the 'reference technique'. Thirty-nine
children, over a period of 10 years, were evaluated: 17 (44%) children had
renovascular disease that involved the proximal three divisions of the renal
arteries, some of which were amenable to treatment. The overall sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for
detecting such renovascular disease, as assessed by changes between pre- and
post-captopril radio-isotope studies, were disappointing at 59%, 68%, 59% and
68%, respectively. When considering only abnormalities in post-captopril studies,
these indices were 82%, 41%, 52% and 75%, respectively. Three children with
potentially treatable renovascular disease were not identified on the captopril
studies. We conclude that renal angiography should remain the 'reference
technique' in identifying children suspected of renovascular hypertension.

Value of diuresis renography in the post-natal period of assumed physiological
renal immaturity.

Eising EG(1), Bonzel KE, Zander C, Farahati J, Reiners C.

Author information: 
(1)Clinic and Polyclinic for Nuclear Medicine, University of Essen, Germany.

The aim of this study was to determine if it is possible to exclude renal
obstruction using diuresis renography in the first 6 weeks of life (the period of
physiological renal immaturity), thus avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures,
such as the Whitaker test or surgery. Diuresis renography with 123I-hippuran was 
performed in 27 patients aged less than 6 weeks and in 50 older children who
acted as a reference group (age 6 weeks to 1 year, n = 28; age 1-10 years, n =
22). All 27 patients had significant dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system on
ultrasonography. Renal curves were evaluated by mathematical curve
characteristics (split renal function, counts, T-max, etc.) as the visual grade
of obstruction. Whole-kidney regions of interest were defined on images summed
over 30 min; renal parenchyma on images summed over 5 min. The renal curves of
18/27 patients indicated tracer accumulation and led to frusemide administration.
Only two patients showed no significant response to frusemide and had to be
further investigated by the Whitaker test. The frequency of kidneys with no
response to frusemide revealed no significant differences in the three groups.
Whole-kidney evaluation resulted in an overestimation of obstruction in 9/150
kidneys, which matches the lower correlation to the DMSA separation values for
this method of evaluation. In contrast with the literature, significant
post-renal obstruction can be excluded by diuresis renography in most cases in
spite of renal immaturity and can help to avoid invasive procedures.

Kidney size estimation in piglets using dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy.

Wallin L(1), Thörne J, Palmer J, Bajc M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Clinical Physiology, University Hospital of Lund, Sweden.

The objective of this study was to validate kidney size measurements obtained by 
DMSA scintigraphy in kidneys of sizes relevant in paediatric practice. Kidney
length, width and volume were measured by DMSA scintigraphy in 10 piglets in vivo
and compared with measurements on excised kidneys using callipers, planar
scintigraphy and submersion in water. In addition, a kidney phantom was
constructed and placed in a torso phantom. The length, width and volume of the
kidney phantom were compared with planar and tomographic scintigraphic
measurements. The mean overestimation of kidney length by scintigraphy was 1.7%
(+/- 1.2%) on excised kidneys and 3.9% (+/- 2.4%) in vivo. The corresponding
figures for width measurements were 7.0% (+/- 3.9%) and 7.8% (+/- 4.4%).
Tomography volume estimation overestimated the submersion volume by 23% (+/-
12%). Scintigraphic measurements on the phantom over-estimated length by 5%,
width by 8% and volume by 11%. Scintigraphic renal length measurements are
reliable and differ from the anatomical length by < 4% compared with excised
kidneys and < 8% in vivo. Scintigraphic width measurements and volume
estimations, especially on small kidneys, are less reliable.

[Use of Tc 99m DTPA in the follow-up of 2 pediatric patients diagnosed with
megacalycosis or Puigvert's disease].

Corunña, España.

OBJECTIVE: Megacalycosis or Puigvert's disease is a congenital anomaly of renal
development characterized by caliceal dilatation, an increased number of calyces,
associated with hypoplasia of the pyramids of Malpighi, and a normal renal
pelvis. Renal function is always normal and there is no evidence of obstruction
to urinary flow. The foregoing are important in distinguishing megacalycosis from
congenital hydronephrosis. We have studied two pediatric patients with this renal
anomaly by means of non invasive techniques, in order to demonstrate they had no 
urinary flow obstruction despite the caliceal dilatation.
METHODS: Two cases of megacalycosis that had been diagnosed at our hospital from 
1991 to 1995 are described and the literature is reviewed. Diagnosis was
basically by intravenous urography. A diuretic renogram with technetium 99m
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Tc 99m DTPA) showed no urinary flow
obstruction in the anomalous kidney. This test was repeated several times,
together with renal function studies like the technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic
acid scan (DMSA Scan).
RESULTS: Both patients are asymptomatic and have a normally functioning kidney
with no scars demonstrable on the DMSA scan. Renal urinary flow studies have
remained within the normal ranges (elimination of more than 40% of the
radionuclide 20 min after the administration of furosemide). US control
evaluations have shown adequate renal growth and persistent caliceal dilatation
in both cases.
CONCLUSIONS: This congenital malformation must be considered when investigating
renal dilatation, since megacalycosis does not require surgical treatment.
Intravenous urography is useful in the diagnosis of this condition and Tc 99m
DPTA is the best test for subsequent control evaluations.

(1)Department of Medical and Radiological Science, University of Modena, Italy.

Renal cortical scintigraphy with Tc-99m DMSA provides an excellent imaging
modality for the assessment of cortical damage secondary to upper urinary tract
infection (UTI).METHODS: The authors evaluated 48 children with UTI, 12 of whom
had a history of vescico-ureteral reflux (from first of fourth degree), by planar
scintigraphy and SPECT using a triple-headed gamma camera equipped with
parallel-hole, high-resolution collimators.
RESULTS: SPECT images yielded positive findings in 36 kidneys, whereas planar
scans yielded positive findings in 18 kidneys. The total number of lesions
detected by SPECT was 51, whereas the number found with the planar technique was 
23.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the superiority of SPECT scanning in
detecting kidney lesions in children with UTI.

Anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibodies versus somatostatin analogs in the
detection of metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma: are carcinoembryonic antigen
and somatostatin receptor expression prognostic factors?

Becker H, Becker W.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Surgery is currently the only potentially curative approach in the
treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In many instances however,
postsurgically elevated or rising plasma calcitonin and/or carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA) levels indicate persistent metastatic disease, although
conventional diagnostic procedures (computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), and invasive venous catheterization) fail to localize the
responsible lesions. Recently, anti-CEA antibodies and somatostatin analogs have 
shown promising results in the staging of MTC. The aim of this study was to
compare the sensitivity of both methodologies, especially for the detection of
occult MTC, and to assess whether there may be correlations between the
scintigraphic behavior and the patients' prognosis.
METHODS: A total of 26 patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma were examined at
our institution between 1977 and 1996. Ten of them had known disease, 14 had
occult metastatic MTC, and 2 were free of disease at the time of presentation.
Fourteen patients were investigated with anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)
(receiving a total of 35 injections: clones BW431/26, BW431/31, IMACIS, or
F023C5, labeled with 99mTc, (111)In or (131)I), and 8 patients were studied with 
(111)In-labeled octreotide. Two patients received potentially therapeutic doses
of (131)I-labeled anti-CEA antibodies. All patients underwent conventional
radiologic evaluation (ultrasonography, CT, and MRI) and/or biopsy within 4
weeks. Additional imaging was performed with 99mTc-(V)-DMSA,
(131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine, 201thallium chloride, 99mTc-methylene
diphosphate, and/or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Clinical
follow-up was obtained.
RESULTS: All patients with established disease had elevated plasma CEA (range,
6.8-345 ng/mL; calcitonin levels between 92 and 11,497 pg/mL), whereas in 9 of 14
occult cases, levels were < or = 5 ng/mL (range, 0.6-829 ng/mL; calcitonin,
72-2920 pg/mL). In patients with known disease, the overall lesion-based
sensitivity was 86% for the anti-CEA MAbs, whereas octreotide was unable to
target any tumor in patients with rapidly progressing disease or distant
metastases (overall sensitivity, 47%). In all patients with occult MTC, anti-CEA 
MAbs and octreotide were able to localize at least one lesion (patient-based
sensitivity, virtually 100%). In patients with postsurgically persistent
hypercalcitoninemia, cervical lymph nodes were identified as the most frequent
site of metastases, whereas in patients with occult and slowly progressing
disease several years after primary surgery, anti-CEA MAbs and octreotide showed 
bilateral involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes; however, tumor to nontumor
ratios were usually higher with octreotide in these cases. With anti-CEA Mabs,
the highest tumor to nontumor ratios were observed in clinically aggressive,
rapidly progressing disease. The sensitivity of all other diagnostic modalities
was, at < or = 50%, significantly lower. Indication for antitumor effects was
observed in a patient receiving 65 mCi of (111)I-labeled F(ab')2 fragments of the
clone F023C5.
CONCLUSIONS: For the detection of occult MTC, anti-CEA MAbs and octreotide seem
to have a sensitivity that is superior to conventional diagnostic modalities,
especially also when used in combination. Better detectability with anti-CEA
antibodies (which may result in higher CEA expression) seems to be associated
with more aggressively growing forms of MTC, whereas somatostatin receptor
expression at normal CEA plasma levels and weaker MAb targeting may be associated
with a more benign clinical course. This is in accordance with the study of
Busnardo et al. (Cancer 1984; 53:278-85), who showed higher CEA serum levels to
be associated with a worse prognosis, as well as with the in vitro findings of
Reubi et al. (Lab Invest 1991;64:567-73), who demonstrated lower somatostatin
receptor expression in less differentiated MTC. Fu

The use of three phase 99Tcm (V)DMSA scintigraphy is reported in a patient with
Paget's disease of bone before and after intravenous pamidronate therapy. It was 
a useful modality for estimating the activity of Pagetoid lesions and the
therapeutic effect of pamidronate, from a different aspect to bone scintigraphy. 
Three phase 99Tcm (V)DMSA scintigraphy evaluates both the blood flow and the
metabolic activity of Pagetoid bone.

Soluble receptors to tumour necrosis factor and interleukin-6 in urine during
acute pyelonephritis.

Tullus K(1), Escobar-Billing R, Fituri O, Lu Y, Brauner A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Woman and Child Health, St Göran's Children's Hospital,
Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.

We compared the urinary concentrations of soluble TNF-I (sTNF-RI), TNF-II
receptors, and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) standardized to urinary creatinine 
concentrations, in children with acute pyelonephritis, in children with non-renal
fever and in healthy controls. These levels were related to the acute
inflammatory response in the kidneys and later renal scarring, as determined by
acute and 1-y follow-up with 99mTC-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA).
The concentrations of the soluble receptors were measured using enzyme
immunoassay (EIA). The urinary levels of sTNF-RI were significantly higher in
children with acute pyelonephritis (median 1320 pg/mmol) than in children with
non-renal fever, children 6 weeks after acute pyelonephritis and healthy controls
(873, 251 and 477 pg/mumol, respectively). Median sTNF-RII urine levels were also
higher in acute pyelonephritis (4123 pg/mumol) than in the three control groups
(2000, 964 and 1850 pg/mumol, respectively). In contrast, the highest urinary
sIL-6R concentrations were found in healthy children (median 420 pg/mumol),
compared to those with acute pyelonephritis (235 pg/mumol), children with
non-renal fever and children 6 weeks after pyelonephritis (137 and 50 pg/mumol,
respectively). No significant difference was found in any of the urinary soluble 
receptor levels in children with or without DMSA uptake defects at the acute or
the 1-y follow-up scintigraphy. In conclusion, although the urinary soluble TNF
receptor levels were higher during acute pyelonephritis, this observation was not
useful for deciding which children needed follow-up after acute pyelonephritis.

[Selective transcatheter embolization for renal artery aneurysms: report of three
cases].

[Article in Japanese]

Kise H(1), Shibahaha T, Yoshimura N, Uchida K, Arima K, Yanagawa M, Kawamura J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.

Selective transcatheter embolization using an interlocking detachable coil (IDC) 
or detachable balloon was performed in three patients with renal artery
aneurysms. All aneurysms were of the saccular type, located on segmental branches
of the renal artery. After the embolization procedures, the levels of LDH, GOT,
WBC and the body temperature were transitionally elevated in all patients.
Complete occlusion of the aneurysms were achieved in all cases. Good clinical
results were achieved in two of these patients without any renal dysfunction.
However, local infarction of ipsilateral renal parenchyma occurred in one patient
immediately after the embolization and a Tc-99m-DMSA renal scintigraphy study
suggested renal dysfunction after infarction, and the level of serum renin
activity was slightly elevated. Selective transcatheter embolization may
constitute an acceptable therapeutic approach for renal artery aneurysms because 
beside avoiding surgery, it has a low risk of complications.

Combined oral treatment with racemic and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid for
removal of mercury in rats.

Occupational Health, Zagreb, Republic of Croatia.

Racemic dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was found more efficient than the
meso-isoform in enhancing the removal of mercury in rats. However, racemic-DMSA
has recently been found more toxic. The efficiency of combined oral treatment
with the two isoforms of DMSA for removal of mercury has now been evaluated.
Female albino rats were treated orally for four days with meso- (M) and/or
racemic- (R) DMSA (1 mmol/kg each), five days after a single intraperitoneal
administration of 203Hg with 0.5 mg HgCl2/kg. The animals were divided into six
groups according to the number of treatments with each isomer: control
(untreated), 4M, 1R + 3M, 2R + 2M, 3R + 1M, and 4R. Whole body, kidney, liver and
brain mercury contents were measured nine days after 203Hg administration. In all
treated groups retention in the whole body and kidneys was greatly reduced. The
groups treated with racemic-DMSA, regardless of the number of doses, showed a
greater removal of mercury than the group treated with meso-DMSA alone (4M). All 
treatments were less efficient in reducing liver retention, and the brain
retention was not affected. It was concluded that even a single application of
the more toxic racemic-DMSA during a four-day oral treatment regimen is
sufficient to improve the removal by meso-DMSA of mercury from rats.

AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of Tc-99m 
(V) DMSA in patients suspected of lung cancer and determine whether this agent
may have value in differentiation between small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell
(NSCLC) lung carcinoma.
METHODS: Thirty-six patients with clinical and radiological suspicion of primary 
lung carcinoma were injected 450-600 MBq of Tc-99m (V) DMSA intravenously. Whole 
body and planar anterior, posterior thorax images were obtained 4-5 h after
injection of the radioactive complex.
RESULTS: Histopathological results confirmed 23 NSCLC, 10 SCLC and 1 metastatic
lung carcinoma and 2 lung abscess. Nineteen of the 23 (82%) NSCLC and all of the 
10 (100%) SCLC cases showed Tc-99m (V) DMSA uptake. Single metastatic lung cancer
also accumulated radiotracer. Lung abscess did not show uptake. Lesion/Nonlesion 
(L/N) ratio of SCLC (1.59 +/- 0.32) and NSCLC (1.43 +/- 0.19) tumour types did
not show statistical difference (p > 0.05). Tc-99m (V) DMSA whole body imaging
also showed bone metastases.
CONCLUSION: Tc-99m (V) DMSA is a noninvasive and cheap imaging method to detect
malignant lung cancers and their bone metastases but, differentiation of SCLC and
NSCLC is not possible.

Pentavalent 99Tcm-DMSA imaging in patients with bone metastases.

Lam AS(1), Kettle AG, O'Doherty MJ, Coakley AJ, Barrington SF, Blower PJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biosciences, University of Canterbury, Kent, UK.

Pentavalent 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99Tcm-(V)DMSA) has an established role
in imaging medullary thyroid carcinoma. There have been case reports of uptake in
bone metastases. Our aims were to compare 99Tcm-(V)DMSA with
99Tcm-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (99Tcm-HDP) in bone metastases, to assess
its value in imaging of bone metastases, and to assess the prospects of the
beta-emitting analogues 186/188Re-(V)DMSA as palliative agents for painful bone
metastases. Ten patients confirmed by a 99Tcm-HDP bone scan to have bone
metastases secondary to carcinoma of the prostate, lung or breast were injected
with 99Tcm-(V)DMSA (600 MBq). Whole-body scans acquired at 3 and 24 h were
compared with the 99Tcm-HDP bone scans. 99Tcm-(V)DMSA showed high soft tissue
background, kidney retention and avid uptake in most bone metastases: 86% of bone
lesions identified on bone scans were detected with 99Tcm-(V)DMSA. The
lesion-to-normal ratios were comparable to or lower than those for 99Tcm-HDP at 3
h, but increased by 24 h. Instances of abnormal uptake in liver, primary lung
tumour, lymph nodes and pleural effusion were observed. We conclude that
99Tcm-(V)DMSA is a tracer for bone metastases (with lower sensitivity than
99Tcm-HDP) and soft tissue tumours. If 186/188Re-(V)DMSA behave similarly, they
may find use in therapy for soft tissue tumours and bony metastases.

Renal cortical imaging with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has become the
imaging test of choice for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. An unusual
uptake pattern was observed in a child receiving chemotherapy for a bladder
rhabdomyosarcoma. Chemotherapy from ifosfamide produces a specific pattern of
injury to the renal tubule that alters uptake of DMSA.

This study was performed to compare imaging ability between pentavalent
99mTc-DMSA and 201TlCl in primary and metastatic brain tumors and to evaluate the
relationship between retention and histologic malignancy.METHODS: Patients with a
brain tumor were selected by MRI and/or CT. Dynamic, early and delayed static
SPECT images of the brain were obtained immediately, 30 min and 3 hr after
intravenous administration of approximately 555 MBq 99mTc(V)-DMSA and 111 MBq
201Tl-Cl, respectively. Both studies were performed on separate days within a
week. Uptake ratios, retention ratio and retention index were calculated and
compared with tumor histology and malignancy grade.
RESULTS: One-hundred six studies were performed on 100 patients and 118 lesions
were demonstrated: 16 glioblastomas, 13 anaplastic astrocytomas (Grade III), 19
astrocytomas (Grade II), 29 meningiomas, 11 schwannomas and 14 metastases.
Approximately 93% and 88%, respectively, of primary and metastatic brain tumors
were demonstrated by 99mTc(V)-DMSA and 201TlCl. The early uptake ratios were
closely related to the tumor vascularity, but had no statistically significant
difference in the tumor histology or histologic malignancy on either
radiopharmaceuticals. The delayed uptake ratio, retention ratio and retention
index were higher in malignant tumors than benign ones on 99mTc(V)-DMSA, however,
there was no statistically significant difference between benign and malignant
tumors on 201TlCl.
CONCLUSION: Technetium-99m(V)-DMSA washout from the tumor was highly dependent
upon its histology and histologic malignancy. The delayed uptake ratio, retention
ratio and retention index significantly reflected tumor histology and clearly
distinguished between benign and malignant tumors with a statistically
significant difference. There was no statistically significant difference in
201TlCl uptake or washout among the brain tumors. Technetium-99m-DMSA is superior
to 201TlCl in imaging quality, sensitivity to brain tumors and specificity for
differentiating benign tumors from malignant ones. These results could suggest
the clinical utility of 99mTc(V)-DMSA in imaging primary and metastatic brain
tumors and differentiating their histological malignancy grade noninvasively.

New renal scarring in children who at age 3 and 4 years had had normal scans with
dimercaptosuccinic acid: follow up study.

Vernon SJ(1), Coulthard MG, Lambert HJ, Keir MJ, Matthews JN.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Child Health, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne.

OBJECTIVE: To determine up to what age children remain at risk of developing a
new renal scar from a urinary tract infection.
DESIGN: Follow up study. Families of children who had normal ultrasound scans and
scanning with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) after referral with a urinary tract 
infection when aged 3 (209) or 4 (220) were invited to bring the children for
repeat scans 2-11 years later. A history of infections since the original scan
was obtained for children not having a repeat scan.
SETTING: Teaching hospital.
SUBJECTS: Children from three health districts in whom a normal scan had been
obtained at age 3-4 years in 1985-1992 because of a urinary tract infection.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Frequency of new renal scars in each age group.
RESULTS: In each group, about 97% of children either had repeat scanning (over
80%) or were confidently believed by their general practitioner or parent not to 
have had another urinary infection. The rate of further infections since the
original scan was similar in the 3 and 4 year old groups (48/176 (27%)) and
55/179 (31%)). Few children in either group known to have had further urinary
infections did not have repeat scanning (3/209 (1.4%) and 4/220 (1.8%)). In the 3
year old group, 2.4% (5/209) had one or more new kidney scars at repeat scanning 
(one sided 95% confidence interval up to 5.0%), whereas none of the 4 year olds
did (one sided 95% confidence interval up to 1.4%). The children who developed
scars were all aged under 3.4 years when scanned originally.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with a urinary tract infection but unscarred kidneys after 
the third birthday have about a 1 in 40 risk of developing a scar subsequently,
but after the fourth birthday the risk is either very low or zero. Thus the need 
for urinary surveillance is much reduced in a large number of children.

Urinary tract infections in children. Epidemiology, evaluation, and management.

Washington, DC, USA.

Accurate documentation of UTIs in children is essential for proper evaluation and
management. Urine cultures with multiple organisms or colony counts less than
50,000 to 100,000 CFU/ml should be considered suspect and require confirmation,
particularly with clean-catch specimens. Children with well-documented UTIs
should be evaluated based on their age and presenting symptoms. Infants and young
children require imaging, usually with a cystogram and sonogram of the kidneys
and bladder. Older girls with febrile UTIs and boys at any age should also be
considered for urinary tract imaging. Renal cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA
has emerged as the imaging study of choice for acute pyelonephritis and renal
scarring in children with UTIs. Treatment of UTIs in children ideally commences
with culture-specific antimicrobial therapy, although treatment may be started in
sick children before culture results are available. Short-course treatment (3-5
days) is sufficient for children with acute uncomplicated lower UTIs. Children
with acute pyelonephritis require 10 to 14 days of antibiotics, which can be
administered on an outpatient basis in older infants and children who are not
toxic, as long as good compliance is expected. Patients with first-time UTIs who 
require imaging should be maintained on low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis until
their workup is completed. Treatment of ABU does not seem necessary if the
urinary tract is otherwise normal. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated 
for children with frequent symptomatic recurrences of UTI and for those with
known VUR. Diagnosis and treatment of underlying voiding dysfunction and
constipation is an essential component of the successful management of UTIs in
children.

A prospective comparison of high-resolution planar, pinhole, and triple-detector 
SPECT for the detection of renal cortical defects.

Comment in
    Clin Nucl Med. 1998 May;23(5):338.

To compare the detection rate of renal cortical defects with Tc-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) using triple-detector SPECT, pinhole, and planar
cortical scintigraphy, the authors prospectively studied 80 kidneys in 40
patients (26 males, 14 females) who ranged in age from 3 months to 26 years
(mean: 7.5 years). They found single or multiple definite defects in 30 kidneys
using SPECT, 23 using pinhole imaging, and 17 using planar imaging (McNemar's
test, two-tailed, P < 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively). SPECT was significantly 
better than pinhole imaging at demonstrating definite defects (P = 0.008). This
study indicates that SPECT, and to a lesser extent pinhole, are superior to
planar imaging for conclusively demonstrating renal cortical defects.

Korea.

A 29-year-old man, with a history of von Recklinghausen's disease, presented with
progressive dyspnea associated with a rapidly growing mass on the right chest
wall. Plain radiograph and CT of the chest revealed a huge soft-tissue mass with 
central low-density area involving the right upper lung and chest wall. SPECT
imaging with Ga-67 citrate, Tl-201 chloride, Tc-99m pentavalent DMSA (V-DMSA),
and Tc-99m MIBI were performed to characterize the mass. The tumor concentrated
Ga-67, Tl-201, and Tc-99m (V) DMSA, but not Tc-99m MIBI. Punch biopsy of the
lesion revealed malignant transformation of a thoracic neuroma
(neurofibrosarcoma). Subsequently, findings compatible with the presence of a
multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1) gene in the tumor was documented, which may explain
the poor uptake of Tc-99m MIBI. The patient did not respond to intensive
chemotherapeutic regimens, and died 3 months later. This case demonstrates the
potential use of combined radionuclide imaging for the detection of malignant
transformation of neurofibroma, as well as for predicting tumor response to
chemotherapy.

A case of intraorbital ectopic lacrimal gland was evaluated with various
radionuclides. CT and MRI with contrast enhancement showed a soft-tissue mass in 
the orbit. The lesion was gallium-avid, but 18F-FDG PET demonstrated very faint
uptake. On early and delayed 201Tl-Cl images, mildly increased uptake and mild
retention were observed. Technetium-99m-(V)-DMSA SPECT showed intense
accumulation on both the early and delayed images. Technetium-99m-pertechnetate
SPECT, demonstrating marked uptake in the lesion, was useful for the differential
diagnosis between intraorbital malignancy and this benign lesion. These
scintigraphic variations played an important role in the tissue characterization 
of this uncommon lesion.

Congenitally small kidneys with reflux as a common cause of nephropathy in boys.

Aiiku Hospital, Japan.

Congenital maldevelopment is sometimes found in small kidneys with ureteral
reflux. However, the incidence of congenitally small kidneys and the frequency of
its association with ureteral reflux remains unknown. Ultrasound scanning,
performed in 4,000 apparently healthy neonates or young infants (males 2,129,
females 1,871), detected 51 children suspected of having small kidneys. A careful
ultrasound re-examination performed one month later in 45 of the 51 children
confirmed small kidneys in eight children, one bilateral and seven unilateral.
Dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) renoscintigraphy revealed small kidneys with generally
diminished uptake in six infants and no uptake unilaterally in the other two
infants. One of the 12 children, who had normal findings on the initial scanning 
and subsequently developed urinary infection, was later diagnosed having
unilateral small kidney with generally reduced DMSA uptake. All seven infants
having small kidneys with reduced tracer uptake were male (incidence, 1:300
boys). All eight small kidneys in the seven boys and four of the six
contralateral non-small kidneys were associated with ureteral reflux, while
neither of the two infants with a non-functioning kidney had ureteral reflux.
Serial ultrasounds documented the poor growth of all small kidneys. Thus,
congenitally small kidneys with generally diminished DMSA uptake were highly
associated with ureteral reflux and especially observed in boys.

Comment in
    Eur J Nucl Med. 1998 May;25(5):547.

Technetium-99m (V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a tumour-imaging agent which
has been used to evaluate medullary thyroid cancer and soft tissue tumours.
Physiological uptake has been demonstrated in the kidneys, nasal mucosa and blood
pool. In addition to positive accumulation in these sites, uptake in the breasts 
has been noted. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the
accumulation of 99mTc (V)-DMSA in the normal breasts of 83 patients. There was no
accumulation in male breasts. On the other hand, 24 of 51 female patients showed 
bilateral symmetrical accumulation in the breasts. Positive uptake was seen in 16
of 23 patients (70%) between 15 and 50 years old, but in only 7 of 25 (28%) above
50 years old. One out of three patients (33%) under 15 years old showed positive 
breast uptake. In conclusion, the female breasts should be included in the
description of a pattern of normal biodistribution of 99mTc (V)-DMSA.

Reliability of 99mtechnetium dimercapto-succinic acid uptake 2 hours after
injection in hydronephrosis.

Yamazaki Y(1), Shi BB, Yago R, Toma H.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Japan.

PURPOSE: The accumulation of radioactivity in the dilated collecting system
potentially influences the calculation of differential renal function on the
radionuclide test. We focused on this reservoir effect in unilateral
hydronephrosis and assessed the reliability of calculating differential renal
function by dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) uptake 2 hours after injection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unilateral partial ureteral obstruction was created in
8-week-old rats. Four weeks after surgery the animals were sacrificed 2 and 24
hours after the injection of tracer. The DMSA uptake rates of the renal
parenchyma and collecting system were measured separately by autowell gamma
counter. Differential function was calculated according to renal parenchymal and 
whole kidney (parenchyma and collecting system) uptake.
RESULTS: There was a higher accumulation of DMSA in the dilated renal pelvis at 2
than at 24 hours. However, DMSA uptake in the collecting system was extremely
small in comparison to that in the parenchyma. As a result; differential renal
function calculated using parenchymal uptake was similar to that calculated using
whole kidney uptake measured 2 and 24 hours after injection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the pure reservoir effect of DMSA uptake at
early measurement is much smaller than reported in previous experimental animal
studies. Further clinical studies are needed to reexamine this reservoir effect
in children with unilateral hydronephrosis.

Arsenic-induced changes in certain neurotransmitter levels and their recoveries
following chelation in rat whole brain.

Arsenic as sodium arsenite (100 ppm in drinking water) was administered to male
rats for 16 weeks. Animals were then treated either with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropane 1-sulfonate
(DMPS), dimethyl DMSA (DmDMSA), or diisopropyl DMSA (DiPDMSA) twice daily (50
mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 5 days. After 5 days of rest period, the animals
were again given a second course of chelation therapy. The animals were
sacrificed subsequently for the determination of whole brain biogenic amines
levels, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase (MAO) and
delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activities. A number of biochemical 
parameters and arsenic concentrations in some tissues were also determined. The
results suggest a significant increase in brain arsenic concentration accompanied
by alterations in neurotransmitters levels following As(III) exposure. Although
chelation treatment was effective in reducing As burden, the altered biochemical 
variables responded less favorably to chelation therapy. The DMSA-diesters,
particularly DiPDMSA, produced a more pronounced increase in brain arsenic
burden, as well as alterations in a few neurotransmitters. It can be concluded
that the lipophilic character of As antidotes may lead to unfavorable results
following intraperitoneal administration.

Screening of newborn babies for familial ureteric reflux.

    Lancet. 1997 Aug 9;350(9075):380.
    Lancet. 1997 Oct 4;350(9083):1031.

BACKGROUND: Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is not usually diagnosed until it is
complicated by urinary infection. Prevention probably requires diagnosis in a
newborn baby before urinary infection occurs because the peak incidence for
infection is in early infancy. VUR is a familial disorder. We sought to find out 
whether an at-risk group of newborn babies could be identified on the basis of
the parents' family history.
METHODS: Over a 3-year period, pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics of 
three hospitals in the northeast of England were screened for evidence of
urinary-tract disease in themselves or their families with a view to eliciting a 
history of VUR. When a woman, her partner, or a member of either family had a
definite (by cystography records) or probable positive history, we recruited the 
mother to our study. Renal ultrasonography and cystography were done on the
newborn babies soon after delivery, and a dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
radioisotope scan at 3 months was done on those with VUR.
FINDINGS: The estimated number of deliveries during the study period was 34,555; 
20,891 women were screened; and 211 were recruited and delivered. The index cases
were identified from a wide range of family relationships, though over half
consisted of mothers and siblings, 19 babies had more than one index case and in 
21 families there was one index for more than one baby or a link between
families. Cystography was carried out on 186 newborn babies; 38 (20.4%) had VUR. 
The proportion of newborn babies with VUR among linked index families was 31%.
Mothers and siblings amounted to 71% of the index cases for newborn babies with
VUR. The difference between confirmed and assumed index cases in VUR prediction
was not significant. The female/male sex ratio among index cases was more than 4,
but among newborn babies with VUR it was 1.5. Renal ultrasound showed no
correlation with VUR, and all DMSA scans but one were normal. No newborn baby
developed complications resulting from cystography.
INTERPRETATION: The screening of pregnant women for familial VUR is worthwhile
because the frequency of VUR among the newborn babies of those with such a
history is significantly higher than in the general population (frequency of VUR 
1-2%), particularly if the family history involves more than one member, or more 
than one generation.

Transient pyelonephritic changes on 99mTechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan
for at least five months after infection.

Jakobsson B(1), Svensson L.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics and Nuclear Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge 
University Hospital, Sweden.

A prospective study was performed on 185 children with symptomatic urinary tract 
infection (UTI), 130F and 55M, having a median age of 0.9 y (range 0.1-9.8) at
the time of UTI. The aim of the study was to find out how the
99mTechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan should be used to investigate
UTI, and to follow the development of renal changes during pyelonephritis into
subsequent permanent renal damage. All children were investigated with a DMSA
scan within 5 days after admission and after 3.9-53.3 (median 9.2) weeks, and 159
were studied again after approximately 2 y (range 1.5-3.9 y). They all underwent 
micturition cystourethrography at the time of the second study. At the time of
infection, the DMSA scan was abnormal in 85% of the children, in 58% at the first
follow-up and in 36% at the second follow-up. An abnormal DMSA scan performed
within 20 weeks from infection became normal in 38% of cases on the third study, 
while only 1/10 abnormal DMSA scans performed more than 20 weeks after infection 
became normal after 1.5-3.9 y. Persistent renal changes were more common in
children > 4 y of age than in children < or = 1 y of age. Two months after the
presenting infection, it was unusual to see a normal DMSA scan in a child with a 
VUR gr. > or = 3. The study suggests that DMSA changes after an index UTI may be 
transient for a longer period of time than has been previously considered.
Therefore, in order to detect persistent changes, a DMSA scan should be performed
more than 5 months after UTI.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Guy's Hospital Trust, London, UK.

A programme of audit, including clinical audit, organizational audit and
patient/clinician satisfaction surveys, has been implemented in nuclear medicine 
departments throughout the South Thames Regional Health Authority (RHA). The
clinical topics which have been audited include. ventilation-perfusion lung
imaging, bone imaging, liver imaging, thyroid imaging and renal static DMSA
imaging. Guidelines have been set for nuclear medicine practice in each of these 
areas against which further audit can be performed. Organizational audits have
been performed in 10 nuclear medicine departments in the South Thames RHA and a
confidential report supplied to the head of each department, consisting of
findings and recommendations. A programme of re-audit has also commenced. The
main findings have been a lack of facilities and space. Patient satisfaction
surveys have been implemented in nine departments and a high level of patient
satisfaction has been demonstrated. A clinical satisfaction survey has been
implemented in 13 departments. It is hoped to continue this successful programme 
of audit to improve nuclear medicine practice by closing audit loops.

Are we ready to replace dimercaprol (BAL) as an arsenic antidote?

Mückter H(1), Liebl B, Reichl FX, Hunder G, Walther U, Fichtl B.

Author information: 
(1)Walther-Straub-Institut für Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, München, Germany.

1 Dimercaprol (BAL), 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulphonate sodium (DMPS) and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) are effective arsenic antidotes, but the 
question which one is preferable for optimal therapy of arsenic poisoning is
still open to discussion. Major drawbacks of BAL include (a) its low therapeutic 
index, (b) its tendency to redistribute arsenic to brain and testes, for example,
(c) the need for (painful) intramuscular injection and (d) its unpleasant odour. 
2 The newer antidotes DMPS and DMSA feature low toxicity and high therapeutic
index. They can be given orally or intravenously due to their high water
solubility. While these advantages make it likely that DMPS and DMSA will replace
BAL for the treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning, acute intoxication-especially
with lipophilic organoarsenicals-may pose a problem for the hydrophilic
antidotes, because their ionic nature can adversely affect intracellular
availability. 3 This article focuses on aspects dealing with the power of BAL,
DMPS, and DMSA to mobilize tissue-bound arsenic in various experimental models,
such as monolayers of MDCK (= Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells from dog kidney,
isolated perfused liver from guinea-pigs, and perfused jejunal segments from rat 
small intestine. 4 The results show that hydrophilic DMPS and DMSA may fail to
rapidly and completely remove arsenic that has escaped from the extracellular
space across tight epithelial barriers. However, owing to their low toxicity,
which allows larger doses to be applied, and the potential modification of their 
pharmacokinetics by means of inert oral anion-exchange resins, DMPS and DMSA may 
advantageously replace BAL whenever intervention time is not critical. With
severe intoxication by organic arsenicals, when the point-of-no-return is a
limiting factor, BAL may still have a place as an arsenic antidote.

New renal scars in children with urinary tract infections, vesicoureteral reflux 
and voiding dysfunction: a prospective evaluation.

Naseer SR(1), Steinhardt GF.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, St. Louis University Medical Center, Missouri, USA.

PURPOSE: Established renal scarring represents areas of the kidney that imaging
reveals to be damaged at presentation for medical management of urinary tract
infection. New renal scarring represents new renal damage in parts of the kidney 
that imaging reveals to be normal at presentation. We attempted to characterize
patients in whom new renal scars developed while they were under our care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 1988 a data base was started to identify patients with 
new renal scarring. All patients presenting with urinary tract infections were
enrolled. Our data base has 250 possible fields per event with multiple events
per patient. More than 2,100 patients have been enrolled to date. All patients
with pyelonephritis, defined as a febrile urinary tract infection with flank pain
and tenderness, and all with reflux underwent dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA)
scan at least 4 months after presenting with infection to assess established
renal scars. New renal scars were identified when new renal defects were
demonstrated on a second DMSA scan.
RESULTS: In our data base there are 1,426 patients with urinary tract infections,
685 (46%) with pyelonephritis and 1,062 (74.5%) with vesicoureteral reflux,
including 558 found to have bilateral vesicoureteral reflux and 504 diagnosed
with unilateral reflux. A history of daytime urinary incontinence was noted in
538 patients (37.7%), 192 (13.5%) had established scars at initial presentation
and in 31 (2.1%) new renal scars developed while they were under our care,
including 30 with established scars as well. Of the 25 patients in whom new renal
scars developed while on medical therapy 11 underwent surgery. In 6 patients with
dysfunctional voiding who were receiving medical treatment renal scars developed 
postoperatively. Surgery was performed in 17 of the 31 patients and 24 (77%) with
new renal scars had a history of dysfunctional voiding.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous characterizations of patients with new renal scars have
relied on excretory urography for assessing renal architecture and ignored
voiding patterns of the children affected. Using the DMSA scan we identified 31
children with reflux, urinary tract infection and dysfunctional voiding in whom
new renal scars developed while they were under our care.

Sciences, Lucknow Marg, Delhi, India.

Significant uptake and retention of 99Tc(m)-dextran (molecular weight: 81,000) in
renal parenchyma was discovered during evaluation of its intravascular use. Renal
SPET images confirmed this. This study was designed to evaluate 99Tc(m)-dextran
as a renal cortex imaging agent. Stability of parenchymal retention was shown by 
insignificant outflow at 24 h and by frusemide intervention. Evaluation of the
renal parameters of intravenous 99Tc(m)-dextran (n = 71 normal kidneys) and its
comparison with 99Tc(m)-DTPA n = 10) and 99Tc(m)-DMSA(III) (n = 23) was
undertaken. The early glomerular extraction phase of the renograms of
99Tc(m)-DTPA and 99Tc(m)-dextran appeared identical; parenchymal uptake of
99Tc(m)-dextran continued to increase and reached a near-plateau by 40-60 min.
The mean cortex-to-background and cortex-to-liver ratios at 2 h with
99Tc(m)-dextran and 99Tc(m)-DMSA(III) were 14.9 and 9.2, and 16.0 and 8.9,
respectively. The target-to-nontarget ratios were similar despite different
absolute renal uptake values (12 vs 20% at 2 h) because of faster background
clearance of 99Tc(m)-dextran. The mechanism of parenchymal retention of
99Tc(m)-dextran appears to be trapping at the endothelial-epithelial interphase
of the glomerulus. Our initial experience suggests 99Tc(m)-dextran is a viable
renal parenchyma imaging agent.

Renal 99Tc(m)-DMSA SPET and planar imaging: are they really the same?

Rodriguez JL(1), Perera A, Fraxedas R, Reyes L, Hernandez A, Solano ME.

Author information: 
(1)Centre for Clinical Research, Playa, Havana, Cuba.

Previous studies have suggested that more defects are detected on SPET than on
planar DMSA images. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences between
planar and SPET imaging. Sixty-four kidneys from pyelonephritic patients were
studied using both techniques. An automated algorithm for reorientation and
centring of the SPET images was used to minimize inter-observer variability.
Reduced uptake and contour defects showed different localization on planar and
SPET imaging. Coincidence of defects on both types of image was low. We also
noted a dependence on defect frequency content for detectability. Image contrast 
played a noticeable role in the detection of defects. Differences in contrast
between SPET and planar images may be responsible for the variable success in the
detection of defects. Contour defects are seen more frequently on tomographic
slices, whereas reduced uptake defects are seen more frequently on planar images.
A difference is also noted between the cortical and calyceal zones for
differently contrasted lesions. SPET and planar DMSA images can potentially
provide a different diagnosis of renal lesions.

Comparison of dimercaptosuccinic acid and calcium disodium
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid versus dimercaptopropanol and
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in children with lead poisoning.

Besunder JB(1), Super DM, Anderson RL.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the response to dimercaptopropanol (BAL) and calcium
disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) versus orally administered
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and EDTA in children with lead poisoning.
METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of children admitted to
MetroHealth Medical Center with a whole blood lead (BPb) concentration of 2.17
mumol/L (45 micrograms/dl) or more (or less than 2.17 mumol/L and not a candidate
for outpatient oral chelation) and treated with BAL + EDTA or DMSA + EDTA. In
each group, the mean BPb values at the end of therapy and at 14 and 33 days after
chelation were compared with pretreatment BPb by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
whereas the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare percentage change from
pretreatment at each follow-up day between the two groups.
RESULTS: Twenty-three children received BAL + EDTA and 22 received DMSA + EDTA.
The BPb values (mean +/- SD) at the end of therapy and at 14 and 33 days after
chelation were significantly lower than pretreatment in both groups (BAL + EDTA: 
17 +/- 10, 34 +/- 7, 36 +/- 11 vs 58 +/- 14 micrograms/dl, p < 0.02, 0.01, 0.001,
respectively; DMSA + EDTA: 10 +/- 4, 30 +/- 10, 30 +/- 14 vs 50 +/- 10
micrograms/dl, p < 0.01, 0.001, 0.01, respectively). The percentage reduction
(mean +/- SD) in BPb from pretreatment at the end of therapy and on days 14 and
33 after chelation did not differ between the groups (BAL + EDTA: -71.2% +/-
19.8%, -40.2% +/- 13.8%, -37.1% +/- 17%; DMSA + EDTA: -79.9% +/- 8.7%, -38.3% +/-
21.6%, -37% +/- 32%; p > 0.20). Elevation of alanine aminotransferase and
vomiting during therapy were observed more frequently in the BAL + EDTA group
compared with the DMSA + EDTA group.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with DMSA or BAL combined with EDTA results in a
comparable reduction in BPb.

Ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the rat kidney: the effect of preconditioning.

Islam CF(1), Mathie RT, Dinneen MD, Kiely EA, Peters AM, Grace PA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.

OBJECTIVES: To design and establish a model to examine whether brief periods of
renal artery occlusion (ischaemic preconditioning, IP) confers protection from
the effects of a subsequent period of ischaemia and reperfusion of the rat
kidney.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety rats were randomized into six groups, i.e.
sham-operated controls; IP alone; a 20 or 40 min period of left renal ischaemia
(RI) alone; and IP followed by a 20 or 40 min period of RI. Preconditioning
involved the sequential clamping of the left renal artery for 4 min and its
release for 11 min, a total of four times, a 'critical interval' of 30 min before
the ischaemic insult. Left renal tissue integrity was determined by
dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) radionuclide imaging on a gamma-camera both
immediately (day 0) and 2 and 9 days later. Acute tubular necrosis was also
assessed histologically.
RESULTS: RI for 20 min resulted in a significant decrease in left renal tissue
integrity on day 2 only (P < 0.001), whereas RI for 40 min caused significant
left renal dysfunction on day 0, day 2 and day 9 (P < or = 0.01). For a given
duration of ischaemia, there was no significant difference between results from
(IP + RI) rats compared with RI-only rats at any of the three times. There was no
significant alteration in renal tissue integrity in the IP-only rats compared
with sham-operated controls. Histological findings paralleled the data obtained
from DMSA uptake.
CONCLUSIONS: The IP regimen and 30 min 'critical interval' confers no protection 
to the kidney from a 20 or 40 min ischaemic episode. The IP regimen itself
appears to have no effect, confirming the validity of our experimental model.

Effect of chelation with meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) before and after the
appearance of lead-induced neurotoxicity in the rat.

Gong Z(1), Evans HL.

Author information: 
(1)Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University Medical
Center, Tuxedo 10987, USA.

This paper examines whether a chelating agent (DMSA) can prevent and reverse the 
effects of lead (Pb) as evidenced by changes in brain glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) concentration and in the habituation pattern of rearing behavior. 
Male F344 rats (42 days old) received Pb acetate at 150 or 2000 ppm as Pb in
their drinking water for 21 days and returned to regular water for another 21
days to observe recovery. Blood Pb (BPb) concentration rose to 37 and 82
microg/dl for 150 and 2000 ppm, respectively. Rats exposed to 150 ppm Pb
exhibited changes in GFAP concentration and behavioral hyperactivity, when placed
in an unfamiliar cage. The 2000 ppm Pb exposure caused greater changes in GFAP,
but behavioral hyperactivity appeared only postexposure, when BPb was declining. 
Chelation (DMSA, 50 mg/kg po, 3 times/week for 21 days) decreased the BPb
concentration, and prevented and reversed the Pb-induced changes in GFAP and
rearing, but not in body weight. Administration of DMSA by itself for 21 days
caused no untoward effects in brain GFAP, behavior, or body weight. Concurrent
administration of DMSA and Pb resulted in no evidence of additive toxicity.
Results indicate that: (1) A brief behavioral test of habituation is a sensitive 
index of neurotoxicity and chelating therapy; (2) Pb-induced hyperactivity
depends upon BPb concentration regardless of whether activity is measured during 
or after exposure; (3) repeated treatment with DMSA is effective in reducing Pb
neurotoxicity; (4) there was no evidence that DMSA enhanced the absorption of Pb.
The finding that DMSA administered late in exposure can hasten the recovery of
toxic signs suggests that extracellular Pb continues to play a significant role
even after toxic signs have appeared.

Urinary excretion of epidermal growth factor in children with reflux nephropathy.

Konda R(1), Sakai K, Ota S, Takeda A, Chida N, Orikasa S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.

PURPOSE: We determined urinary levels of epidermal growth factor in children with
reflux nephropathy to evaluate the clinical significance of urinary epidermal
growth factor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 59 boys and 41 girls 3 to 15 years old with
reflux nephropathy, and 64 boys and 36 girls 3 to 15 years old who were healthy. 
Levels of urinary epidermal growth factor were determined by sandwich enzyme
immunoassay using spot urine samples. We also determined the levels of serum
creatinine, urinary alpha 1-microglobulin and urinary microalbumin. Absolute
values of function of the left and right kidneys were assessed by 99mtechnetium
dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) uptake.
RESULTS: Levels of urinary epidermal growth factor gradually decreased with age
in healthy children. There were low levels of urinary epidermal growth factor in 
20 of the 44 patients (45%) with unilateral low DMSA uptake and 18 of the 19
(95%) with low total DMSA uptake (right and left uptakes). Urinary epidermal
growth factor significantly correlated with serum creatinine (R = -0.702, p <
0.0001), urinary alpha 1-microglobulin (R = -0.606, p < 0.0001), urinary
microalbumin (R = -0.708, p < 0.0001) and total DMSA uptake (R = 0.744, p <
0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that urinary epidermal growth factor may be a 
useful clinical tool to monitor functional nephron mass in children with reflux
nephropathy.

The possibility of using technetium-99m(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid, Tc-99m DMSA, 
in the evaluation of uveal amelanotic melanoma was assessed in this study. Both
planar and SPECT images clearly demonstrated the tumor. Following confirmation of
our results by contemporaneous ultrasonography and MRI the patient was treated
with Iodine-125 brachytherapy. In combination with other diagnostic tests,
Tc-99m(V) DMSA scintigraphy may play a role in the detection of uveal melanoma
and its possible systemic metastases.

A 31-year-old male having familial amyloid polyneuropathy underwent a
Tc-99m(V)-DMSA study to evaluate the myocardial involvement. The patient also
underwent T1-201, I-123-BMIPP and I-123-MIBG myocardial SPECT studies to evaluate
blood perfusion, fatty acid metabolism and sympathetic function of the heart,
respectively. Tc-99m(V)-DMSA SPECT showed uptake to the myocardium indicating
myocardial involvement of amyloidosis. Both T1-201 and I-123-BMIPP studies showed
normal uptake indicating normal blood perfusion and fatty acid metabolism but
I-123-MIBG SPECT showed no uptake to the heart, indicating severe impairment of
sympathetic function.

Comparison of radiochemical purity control methods for 99Tcm radiopharmaceuticals
used in hospital radiopharmacies.

Mallol J(1), Bonino C.

Author information: 
(1)Dipartamento Ingeniería Química y Tecnología Farmacéutica, Universidad de La
Laguna, Tenerife, Spain.

The free fraction of pertechnetate in 99Tcm radiopharmaceuticals has to be tested
for quality control reasons in line with the European Pharmacopoeia. Such quality
control is often performed by miniaturized chromatographic methods. There are
several recommended methods in the literature for quality control of the same
radiopharmaceuticals, though it is unlikely that all methods are equivalent. Some
of these methods were compared, taking into account different parameters (spot
size, time required, analytical artifacts, true separation and shape of the
chromatographic peaks, ease of handling), to verify the best method for the
control of each radiopharmaceutical. It would appear that instant thin layer
chromatography silica gel is the best support for these miniaturized methods,
using MEK as solvent to check DTPA, DMSA, gluconate, pyrophosphate, medronate and
phytate; NaCl 20% solution is the best solvent for IDA derivatives, human albumin
and albumin particles (microspheres, macroaggregates).

[Progression of renal disease in patients with reflux nephropathy. Follow-up
study].

[Article in Japanese]

(1)Department of Urology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University.

BACKGROUND: We previously estimated the turning point of reflux nephropathy
irreversibly deteriorating to end stage renal disease, mainly based on findings
in renal biopsy (Eur. Urol., 26: 153-159, 1994). In this study, we aim to
evaluate clinical parameters which may be closely associated with progression of 
reflux nephropathy to end stage renal disease.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ninety five patients (84 children and 11 adults; 41 men and
54 women) with renal scar and/or reflux (>/ = grade 3), mean aged 9.4 +/- 9.1
years (3 months-53 years) were followed up for 3.7 years +/- 2.7 (6 months-18
years). Vesicoureteral reflux was bilateral in 64 and unilateral in 31; primary
in 85 and secondary in 10 patients. Clinical parameters including body weight,
height, blood pressure, 24 hour urinary protein excretion, serum creatinine, 99m 
Tc-DTPA GFR and 99 m Tc-DMSA uptake were monitored over time. All patients
underwent antireflux surgery (with or without other reconstructive surgery) and
open renal biopsy. Three patients progressing to end stage renal disease
underwent subsequent biopsy.
RESULTS: Over-5 year observation period, the prevalence of new scare formation
and further extension in scar was significantly higher in the group of renal
functional deterioration (35%) than in the group of stable renal function (6.0%).
Over the same period DMSA uptake decreased significantly (< 0.05) in the group of
scar b (Smellie's classification), suggesting most kidneys of scar b eventually
resulting in atrophic kidney (scar c). Proteinuria more than 100 mg/day appeared 
to be a critical level for predicting irreversible deterioration in renal
function. Glomerular hypertrophy was closely related to the increase in urinary
protein excretion and serum creatinine, contrary to the decrease in DTPA-GFR. In 
addition, bilateral renal scar b, glomerular hypertrophy (> 2 SD), proteinuria (>
300 mg/day), low GFR (mean: 49 ml/min), and diastolic hypertension seemed to be
implicated in the genesis of ESRD.
CONCLUSION: Glomerular damage due to either reflux nephropathy or dysplasia may
cause proteinuria. Proteinuria of 100 mg/day was significantly (p < 0.01)
associated with 2 SD of glomerular hypertrophy on histology and clinical
observation (suggesting hyperfiltration). Thereafter, a rapid increase in
proteinuria followed by diastolic hypertension appears be significant for
predicting ESRD.

Availability of rhenium-188 from the alumina-based tungsten-188/rhenium-188
generator for preparation of rhenium-188-labeled radiopharmaceuticals for cancer 
treatment.

Rhenium-188 (beta- = 2.2 MeV; gamma = 155 keV; T1/2 16.9 hours) is an attractive 
therapeutic radioisotope which is produced from decay of the reactor-produced
tungsten-188 parent (T1/2 69 days) and thus conveniently obtained on demand by
elution from the alumina-based tungsten-188 /rhenium-188 generator system. The
rhenium-188 is obtained as sodium perrhenate by elution of the generator with
0.9% saline. The post elution use of disposable tandem, ion-exchange columns is a
simple method for the concentration of rhenium-188 saline solutions with specific
volumes > 500 mCi/ml. This method can also extend the useful shelf-life of the
generator, which can be as long as one year. The long useful shelf-life of the
generator is expected to provide rhenium-188 at very reasonable costs for routine
preparation of a variety of radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of a variety
of cancers including breast cancer. We are evaluating two types of Re-188-labeled
agents under investigation which have potential for the treatment of breast
cancer. Rhenium-188-labeled hydroxyethylidenediphosphonate (HEDP) and
Re-188-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) are being applied for palliative treatment 
of pain associated with skeletal metastases, and the Re-188-RC-160 somatostatin
analogue [cyclic NH2-(D)-Phe-Cys-Try-(D)-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Trp-NH2] for
somatostatin-receptor-positive tumors. The results of initial clinical studies
with the two bone pain agents demonstrate good targeting to skeletal metastases, 
and use of Re-188-HEDP has resulted in pain palliation with minimal bone marrow
suppression in the initial patient studies. While these initial studies have been
conducted in patients with prostate cancer, similar results are expected in
planned studies in breast cancer patients. In animal studies, Re-188-RC-160 has
been successfully used for the local/regional treatment of experimental breast
cancer and other cancers. Re-188-RC-160 binds to somatostatin-receptor-positive
cells both in vitro and in vivo, including breast cancer cells (ZR-75-1 breast
carcinoma and NCI-H69 human small cell ling carcinoma), but not to
binding-negative cells (Raji, Burkitt's lymphoma). A structurally similar
Re-188-cyclic peptide with different binding specificity (CTOP [cyclic
NH2-(D)-Phe-Cys-Try-(D)-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-ol]; an opiate-receptor antagonist)
did not bind to target cells. Both gentisic acid and ascorbic acid are present in
the Re-188-HEDP and Re-188-RC-160 formulations, and have been found to also
significantly reduce radiolytic degradation of the somatostatin peptide
analogues, and may have general application in the stabilization of
Re-188-labeled radio-pharmaceuticals.

Value of 99m-Tc MIBI and 99m-Tc(V) DMSA scintigraphy in evaluation of breast mass
lesions.

Among several investigative methods currently undergoing evaluation for the
differentiation of biological features of breast mass lesions, mammoscintigraphy 
with different radiopharmaceuticals appears promising. This study evaluated the
efficacy of 99m-Tc MIBI and 99m-Tc(V) DMSA mammoscintigraphy in the detection of 
malignant focal breast lesions. Mammography, ultrasonography, 99m-Tc MIBI and
99m-Tc(V) DMSA mammoscintigraphy were performed in 51 women with palpable breast 
mass lesions. Following surgical removal of the abnormalities, histological
examination revealed 40 malignant and 11 benign breast mass lesions. In
mammoscintigraphy, early (5 minute p.i. of MIBI, 2 hours p.i. of DMSA) and late
(2 hours p.i. of MIBI and 5 hours p.i. of DMSA) planar images of the breast and
the axillary regions were evaluated visually and quantitatively. The efficacy of 
the methods was assessed via ROC curves and variance analysis. The visual scores 
and the quantitative T/NT values with MIBI demonstrated a significant difference 
between malignant and benign breast mass lesions. A significant difference was
also found as concerns the grade of malignancy from the MIBI accumulation. The
late MIBI images seemed optimal. The DMSA values indicated no relationship with
the breast lesion malignancy. In the detection of metastatic lymph node
involvement the sensitivity and specificity with mammography and ultrasonography 
were 57% and 85%, with MIBI 53% and 81%, and with DMSA 53% and 95%, respectively.
It is concluded that MIBI (2 hours p.i.) mammoscintigraphy is a useful and simple
method for differentiation of malignant breast abnormalities from benign lesions 
and for determination of the grade of malignancy. DMSA mammoscintigraphy appears 
superior to MIBI only in the detection of axillary lymph node metastases.

Comparison of In-111 pentetreotide, Tc-99m (V)DMSA and I-123 mlBG scintimaging in
neural crest tumors.

Medical School, Greece.

Three radiolabelled substances, 111In-pentetreotide, 99mTc-(V)DMSA and 123I-MIBG 
with different kinetics but similar tumor seeking behavior, were i.v. injected to
assess and correlate their clinical value in metastatic malignant
pheochromocytomas (4 patients), stage III and IV neuroblastomas (7 patients) and 
medullary thyroid carcinomas (6 patients). All II pheochromocytoma/neuroblastoma 
patients received i.v. a dose of III MBq (3 mCi) of 123I-MIBG and 185 MBq (5 mCi)
of 111In-pentetreotide, within approximately weeks each other. Furthermore, in 4 
of these patients as well as in all medullary thyroid carcinoma patients 111 MBq 
(3 mCi) of 99mTc-(V)DMSA were applied i.v. I week prior to the pentetreotide/mlBG
scans. Four patients (malignant pheochromocytoma) with a total of 7 foci showing 
MIBG accumulation had 3 sites with pentetreotide and 1 site with (V)DMSA uptake, 
while in 7 patients (neuroblastora) with 15 foci showing MIBG accumulation 10
sites had detectable pentetreotide and 3 sites detectable (V)DMSA. Of the three
radiotracers, 111In-pentetreotide used for somatostatin receptor identification
holds promise mainly in cases where foci imaged with 123I-MIBG are negative.
111In-pentetreotide is unlikely to replace 123I-MIBG as a first-line routine
diagnostic scintigraphic modality; compared to pentetreotide or MIBG, (V)DMSA
seems to be highly sensitive only in medullary thyroid carcinomas.

OBJECTIVE: To develop criteria identifying swollen kidneys on dimercaptosuccinic 
acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy in acute pyelonephritis with regard to the DMSA
distribution pattern, kidney functional size, and radioactive uptake.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight children aged 15 days to 7 years with known
pyelonephritis were examined with DMSA renal scintigraphy. All children were
observed 2 or 3 times. In total, 94 scintigrams were evaluated. Qualitative and
quantitative criteria for swelling were defined.
RESULTS: Thirty-one observed kidneys satisfied the criteria of swelling.
Quantitatively, kidney length and width/length were greater in swollen kidneys.
Kidney uptake in percent of injected dose and kidney uptake/background were lower
in swollen kidneys. Qualitatively, focal radioactive uptake defects known from a 
previous examination were sometimes obscured by swelling, and reappeared at
follow-up. In 5 children with signs of swelling on repeat imaging, scintigraphy
reinfection at the time of swelling was verified.
CONCLUSIONS: Swollen kidneys may be the only sign of acute pyelonephritis on DMSA
scintigraphy and swelling may obscure focal radioactive uptake defects.
Measurement of kidney size and radioactive uptake can help identify swollen
kidneys at DMSA scintigraphy and disclose acute pyelonephritis in the absence of 
overt clinical symptoms.

Lead poisoning in children.

Berlin CM Jr(1).

Author information:

University College of Medicine, Harshey 17033-0850, USA.

Increased lead exposure and increased body burden of lead remains a significant
problem for children in the United States. With the increased use of blood level 
screening methods, a large percentage of children in many industrialized
countries are being tested as a being at risk. A controversy continues over the
definition of what population to screen and at what age to screen. There are
parts of the United States, especially rural areas and health maintenance
organization populations, where screening for lead exposure has not been
productive. A new drug, DMSA (meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) has been approved
for oral chelation of children with increased body burden of lead. At the present
time it is labeled for use in children with blood lead concentrations in excess
of 45 micrograms/dL. Evidence exists that DMSA is effective in lowering the blood
lead concentrations in children with levels between 25 and 45 micrograms/dL. The 
long-term effectiveness of chelation at lower levels is at present uncertain.
There remains no substitution for strict environmental decontamination in the
home environment of children and the workplace environment of their parents.

delta-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase genotype modifies four hour urinary lead
excretion after oral administration of dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Schwartz BS(1), Lee BK, Stewart W, Sithisarankul P, Strickland PT, Ahn KD, Kelsey
K.

and Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.

OBJECTIVES: Previous research suggests that binding of lead by
delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) may vary by ALAD genotype. This
hypothesis was tested by examining whether ALAD genotype modifies urinary lead
excretion (DMSA chelatable lead) after oral administration of dimercaptosuccinic 
acid (DMSA).
METHODS: 57 South Korean lead battery manufacturing workers were given 5 mg/kg
oral DMSA and urine was collected for four hours. Male workers were randomly
selected from two ALAD genotype strata (ALAD1-1, ALAD1-2) from among all current 
workers in the two plants (n = 290). Subjects with ALAD1-1 (n = 38) were
frequency matched with subjects with ALAD1-2 (n = 19) on duration of employment
in the lead industry. Blood lead, zinc protoporphyrin, and plasma aminolevulinic 
acid concentrations, as well as ALAD genotype, duration of exposure, current
tobacco use, and weight were examined as predictors or effect modifiers of levels
of DMSA chelatable lead.
RESULTS: Blood lead concentrations ranged from 11 to 53 micrograms/dl, with a
mean (SD) of 25.4 (10.2) micrograms/dl. After 5 mg/kg DMSA orally, the workers
excreted a mean (SD) 85.4 (45.0) micrograms lead during a four hour urine
collection (range 16.5-184.1 micrograms). After controlling for blood lead
concentrations, duration of exposure, current tobacco use, and body weight,
subjects with ALAD1-2 excreted, on average, 24 micrograms less lead during the
four hour urine collection than did subjects with ALAD1-1 (P = 0.05). ALAD
genotype seemed to modify the relation between plasma delta-aminolevulinic acid
(ALA) and DMSA chelatable lead. Workers with ALAD1-2 excreted more lead, after
being given DMSA, with increasing plasma ALA than did workers with ALAD1-1 (P
value for interaction = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: DMSA chelatable lead may partly reflect the stores of bioavailable
lead, and the current data indicate that subjects with ALAD1-2 have lower stores 
than those with ALAD1-1. These data provide further evidence that the ALAD
genotype modifies the toxicokinetics of lead-for example, by differential binding
of current lead stores or by differences in long-term retention and deposition of
lead.

[The treatment of the primary intrarenal reflux. Is the surgery always
necessary?].

[Article in Spanish]

Miguélez Lago C(1), Galiano Duro E, García Mérida M, García Soldevila N.

Author information:

THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY was to evaluate the relationship between intrarenal reflux
(I.R.R.) and reflux nephropathy (R.N.) in order to know the results of surgical
and non surgical treatment. Fifty one children with 64 kidneys with primary
I.R.R. were studied. 53% of them were less than one year of age. Initial
examination were: urography, ultrasounds, cystography and DMSA scan; the follow
up was done with ultrasounds, DMSA scan and cystography. When no R.N. was
present, grade of reflux was < IV, and age < 12 years, a non surgical treatment
was indicated.RESULTS: During first examination R.N. was demonstrated in 47% of
kidneys; the main difference was the grade of reflux: 16/44 II-III (36%) and
14/20 IV-V (70%). Surgical treatment was performed in 42 (82%) children and non
surgical in 9 (18%). Reflux stopped in 98% and 100%, respectively. Only one
child, without R.N., developed a new renal scar, and a previous R.N. progressed
in two. I.R.R. can be treated successfully without surgery in selected cases.

Comparative in vivo lead mobilization of meso- and rac-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acids in albino Wistar rats.

Jones MM(1), Singh PK, Kostial K, Blanusa M, Piasek M, Restek-Samarozija N.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37235, USA.

Comparison of the racemic and meso forms of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in
lead mobilization from lead-loaded albino Wistar rats demonstrates that the
racemic form is significantly more effective in reducing femur lead levels. After
four oral doses at 0.5 mmol/kg, femur lead levels were reduced to 87% of control 
values by meso-DMSA and to 50% of control levels by rac-DMSA. Similarly, when the
dose was increased to 1.0 mmol/kg, femur lead levels were reduced to 69% of
control levels by meso-DMSA and to 45% of control levels by rac-DMSA. A similar
pattern was found for renal lead levels. Brain lead concentrations were
significantly lower in treated groups than in control groups, but no differences 
were found between rac- and meso-DMSA. Rac-DMSA is more soluble than meso-DMSA in
acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, and ethyl ether. The partition coefficient of
rac-DMSA in the n-octanol/water system was found to be about 2.8. These results
indicate that rac-DMSA deserves further attention as a possible substitute for
meso-DMSA.

Estimation of differential renal function in children with a prenatal diagnosis
of unilateral pelvic dilatation.

Brookes JA(1), Gordon I.

Author information: 
(1)Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, National Medical Laser Centre,
London, England.

PURPOSE: We compared the estimation of differential renal function by
99mtechnetium (Tc)-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) and 99mTc-pentetic acid
scintigraphic methods for followup of prenatally diagnosed unilateral renal
pelvic dilatation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed differential renal function
estimations calculated by static and dynamic methods in time matched test pairs
that were included in the charts of 51 children monitored for prenatally
diagnosed unilateral renal pelvic dilatation at our institution in a 5-year
period.
RESULTS: There were 96 test pairs with available archived raw data. Using the
analytic method of assessment of agreement between the 2 tests, a 95% limit of
agreement of +/-9% was calculated. Of the 96 pairs of tests the results of 94
revealed no significant difference. Subgroup analysis by patient age and
operative intervention (13 postoperative pairs) also showed no difference in the 
results of the 2 tests.
CONCLUSIONS: We established the 95% limits of agreement between 99mTc-DMSA and
99mTc-pentetic acid tests of differential renal function to be +/-9% discrepancy 
in 96 test pairs. During followup of prenatally diagnosed unilateral renal pelvic
dilatation the assessment of differential renal function can be made by
99mTc-DMSA static or dynamic diuretic renography techniques. This
interchangeability is consistent at all patient ages regardless of operative
intervention. Since dynamic diuretic renography provides differential function
and drainage data, using 99mTc-DMSA in this context is unnecessary and subjects
patients to an unnecessary radiation burden.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the curative effect of integrated traditional and
western medicine (TCM-WM) therapy on hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD).
METHODS: Eighty patients with HLD were divided randomly into two groups (TCM-WM
group and WM group), TCM-WM group (40 cases) were given orally dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) and Gandou ([symbol: see text]) decoction for 1 month. The efficacy
was compared with that of 40 cases treated with DMSA as the control. The changes 
of urinary trace and macro-elements before and after treatment were observed.
RESULTS: The total effective rate of TCM-WM group was significantly higher than
that of WM group (P < 0.05), especially more patients with hepatic type responded
well to treatment with TCM-WM than with only chelating agent DMSA. Urinary trace 
and macro-elements were all obviously elevated in patients of two groups after
treatment (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: TCM-WM therapy appears extremely promising as new cupruretic method
for treatment of HLD. It is particularly suitable for treating the patient with
hepatic type.

Organization of the DMSO respiratory operon of Rhodobacter capsulatus and its
consequences for homologous expression of DMSOR/TMAOR.

Knäblein J(1), Dobbek H, Schneider F.

Author information: 
(1)Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie, Martinsried, Germany.

In this report we describe the organization of the respiratory operon from the
non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus and its consequences
for homologous expression of recombinant dimethylsulfoxide/trimethylamine N-oxide
reductase (DMSOR/TMAOR). This enzyme is of special interest since molybdopterin
dinucleotide is its only cofactor. Overexpression of the dmsA gene and production
of active enzyme is not possible in E. coli because this bacterium is unable to
supply the required complex molybdopterin cofactor. To investigate the catalytic 
mechanism and binding of the cofactor by structure-based site-directed
mutagenesis, and to ensure sufficient production and incorporation of the complex
cofactor, we designed a system for homologous expression in R. capsulatus.

Expression and epitope tagging of the membrane anchor subunit (DmsC) of
Escherichia coli dimethyl sulfoxide reductase.

Turner RJ(1), Busaan JL, Lee JH, Michalak M, Weiner JH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

Escherichia coli dimethyl sulfoxide reductase is a heterotrimer comprising a
catalytic subunit (DmsA), an electron transfer subunit (DmsB) and an integral
membrane anchor subunit (DmsC). DmsC is not antigenic and the production of
antibodies to this subunit has not been successful. We have tagged DmsC at the
C-terminus with a dystrophin-specific amino acid sequence (dysp) to which
antibodies are readily available. We were able to use this tagging technique to
monitor expression and localization of DmsC in E. coli and non-muscle eukaryotic 
cells. Growth properties of wild-type E. coli, strain HB101, overexpressing
DmsC:dysp suggest that the expression of DmsC is lethal to E. coli. The lethality
could be overcome by utilizing an E. coli F0F1 ATPase mutant as the host. Growth 
conditions of culture density, duration of induction, temperature of incubation
after induction and media conditions were investigated to optimize DmsC:dysp
accumulation levels. In order to alleviate the problem arising from the toxicity 
of DmsC, expression in eukaryotic tissue culture was also explored. A plasmid
expressing DmsC:dysp was transfected into COS-1 or McA-RH777 cells. The presence 
of expressed DmsC:dysp was confirmed using specific anti-dysp antibodies and
immunofluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that the DmsC:dysp was localized 
to the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of DmsC:dysp did not appear to be toxic 
to the eukaryotic cells. These data suggest methodologies to overcome lethality
problems associated with the overexpression of integral membrane proteins like
DmsC.

Associations of subtypes of hemoglobin with delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase
genotype and dimercaptosuccinic acid-chelatable lead levels.

Schwartz BS(1), Lee BK, Stewart W, Ahn KD, Kelsey K, Bressler J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Environmental Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and
Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.

Hemoglobin in erythrocytes may be an important intravascular site of lead
binding. We examined associations of hemoglobin subtypes A1 and A2 with
delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) genotype, a protein that is another 
important site of erythrocyte lead binding. After oral administration of
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA-chelatable lead), we also examined 4-h lead
excretion, which provides an estimate of bioavailable lead stores. We randomly
selected 57 South Korean current lead battery manufacturing workers from two
plants (N = 290 employees) and from two ALAD genotype strata (ALAD1-1 and
ALAD1-2). These workers voluntarily administered 5 mg/kg oral DMSA. We
frequency-matched subjects with ALAD1-1 (n = 38) to subjects with ALAD1-2 (n =
19) with respect to duration of employment in the lead industry. Blood lead
levels ranged from 11 to 53 microg/dl (mean +/- standard deviation, 25.4 +/- 10.2
microg/dl). After administration of oral DMSA, workers excreted a mean lead level
of 85.4 (standard deviation, 45.0 microg; range, 16.5-184.1 microg). Hemoglobin
A1 and A2 ranged from 3.7% to 9.9% and 1.6% to 5.9%, respectively (mean +/-
standard deviation, 6.2 +/- 1.0% and 2.7 +/- 0.8%, respectively). Subjects with
ALAD1-1 had elevated mean hemoglobin A1 levels (adjusted p = .05). In addition,
higher hemoglobin A1 levels were associated with higher DMSA-chelatable lead
levels (adjusted p = .03). This, as well as the results of prior research,
suggest that both ALAD and hemoglobin A1 may be important lead-binding sites that
influence urinary lead excretion after administration of DMSA.

MAG3 SPECT: a rapid procedure to evaluate the renal parenchyma.

Sfakianakis GN(1), Georgiou MF.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, University of Miami School of Medicine/Jackson
Memorial Hospital, Florida, USA.

Renal parenchymal (cortical) scintigraphy (planar or SPECT) is indicated for the 
diagnosis and follow-up of focal functional disorders, such as acute
pyelonephritis, and for accurate quantitation of split renal function, especially
in cases of atypical location of the kidney(s). This static imaging procedure is 
currently performed 3-5 hr after the injection of a cortical fixation agent,
99mTc-DMSA or 99mTc-GH, and requires effective immobilization of the patient for 
30 min.METHODS: In five healthy adult volunteers and five children with various
clinical indications, SPECT renal parenchymal scintigraphy was performed with a
three-detector camera in 1-min per revolution sequential intervals for a total
acquisition time of 4 min, beginning immediately after an intravenous injection
of a graduated dose of 20 mCi (minimum 2 mCi) of the dynamic renal agent
99mTc-MAG3.
RESULTS: Tomograms of the renal parenchyma reconstructed in three projections and
volume-rendered reprojection of the SPECT-volume data indicated normal or
abnormal renal parenchyma. Comparisons were made with planar MAG3 and SPECT-GH
and favored MAG3-SPECT. However, comparisons with DMSA indicated certain
disadvantages of MAG3 SPECT. For most organs, the radiation dose estimates from
20 mCi MAG3 were lower than those from DMSA (6 mCi) or GH (20 mCi). Simultaneous 
injection of MAG3 and a diuretic (2-40 mg furosemide) resulted in lower than
usually reported radiation dose estimates for the urinary bladder (target organ) 
and the gonads, and allowed subsequent evaluation of the drainage system.
CONCLUSION: MAG3 SPECT is feasible, clinically useful and may be offered as a
rapid (4 min) renal parenchymal imaging procedure, or it may precede planar
dynamic (dluretic) MAG3 scintigraphy.

The effect of 2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid in the treatment of lead poisoning in
adults.

Lifshitz M(1), Hashkanazi R, Phillip M.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Clinical Toxicology, Soroka Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel.

Four patients, aged 22-60, belonging to a single family that had been exposed to 
lead-contaminated food for an unknown period, and nine workers, aged 20-65, who
had been exposed to air-borne lead for 6-8 years, were evaluated for lead
poisoning in our centres. Blood lead levels were 3.57 +/- 0.39 micromol/L (mean
+/- SD) in the family members and 3.46 +/- 0.43 micromol/L (mean +/- SD) in the
group of workers. 2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) therapy was instituted in
the four family members while the nine workers were closely monitored after being
removed from the contaminated environment without receiving any chelation
therapy. DMSA therapy given for the duration of 19 days reduced the blood lead
levels to 0.63 +/- 0.44 micromol/L (mean +/- SD), P<0.01, in the four family
members. No significant change was observed in the untreated group. The exposure 
time in the untreated group was probably longer than that in the treated group.
Following long-term exposure most of the lead in the body is found in the bones
and therefore not easily removed by chelation therapy. No side-effects were
reported in the treated group and no rebound elevation of blood lead levels was
observed during the therapy period or during the 12-week follow-up period
following cessation of therapy. We conclude that 19 days of chelation therapy
with DMSA in adults with moderate to severe lead poisoning is effective and safe.

The evaluation of acute pyelonephritis and renal scarring with technetium
99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy: evolving concepts and future
directions.

Rushton HG(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, D.C.,
USA.

Technetium 99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy has emerged as the
imaging agent of choice for the detection and evaluation of acute pyelonephritis 
and renal cortical scarring in children. Consequently, DMSA scintigraphy provides
a unique opportunity to study the progression of renal damage and functional loss
from the initial insult of acute pyelonephritis to the subsequent development of 
irreversible renal scarring. Over the last few years, clinical and experimental
investigations using DMSA renal scintigraphy have provided new insights into the 
etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical outcome of acute pyelonephritis in
children. These studies have confirmed the primary role of the acute inflammatory
response, associated with both reflux and nonreflux pyelonephritis, in the
etiology of irreversible renal scarring. Furthermore, several studies have shown 
that renal scarring can be prevented or diminished by the early diagnosis and
treatment of pyelonephritis. This review highlights these recent observations and
makes recommendations regarding current clinical and future research
applications.

(1)Department of Pediatrics, CHU de Saint Etienne, Hôpital Nord, F-42055 Saint
Etienne Cedex, France.

OBJECTIVE: Accurate diagnosis of pyelonephritis using clinical and laboratory
parameters is often difficult, especially in children. The main aims of this
prospective study were to compare the value of different imaging techniques
[renal sonography, cortical scintigraphy with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic
acid (99mTc DMSA) and computed tomography (CT)] in detecting renal involvement in
acute urinary tract infections and to determine the sensitivity of DMSA scans for
permanent renal scars 6 months later.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 1992 and January 1993, 55 children
admitted to our pediatric unit with febrile symptomatic urinary tract infections 
were eligible for analysis. Ultrasonography (US), DMSA scanning and micturating
cystourethrography were performed in every case. Only 18 children underwent CT. A
second DMSA scan was performed in 48 children a mean of 7.5 months after the
first.
RESULTS: US abnormalities were found in 25 children (45 %). The first DMSA scan
showed a parenchymal aspect suggestive of pyelonephritis in 51 patients (93 %).
Among the 18 patients studied by CT, 14 had abnormalities. Normal US findings did
not rule out renal parenchymal involvement. Scintigraphy appeared to be more
sensitive than CT for renal involvement. The frequency and degree of initial
renal parenchymal damage seemed to correlate with vesicoureteral reflux, but the 
most severe initial parenchymal defects were not associated with marked clinical 
or laboratory manifestations. Repeat DMSA scans, performed on 45 kidneys with
abnormalities at the first examination, showed resolution in 19, improvement in
16, persistence in 8 and deterioration in 2. The prevalence of vesicoureteral
reflux was not higher in patients with renal scarring on the second DMSA scan
than in patients whose scans showed an improvement.
CONCLUSION: DMSA scans should be considered as a reference in the detection and
follow-up of renal scarring associated with acute urinary tract infection as this
technique is more sensitive than US and CT, the latter being unsuitable because
it entails radiation exposure and sedation of patients.

Utilization of renal slices to evaluate the efficacy of chelating agents for
removing mercury from the kidney.

Keith RL(1), Setiarahardjo I, Fernando Q, Aposhian HV, Gandolfi AJ.

Author information: 
(1)Center for Toxicology, The University of Arizona, Tucson 85721, USA.

Mercury is an environmental contaminant that preferentially accumulates in the
kidney. It has been previously shown using proton-induced X-ray emission analysis
that mercury (HgCl2) accumulated in precision-cut rabbit renal cortical slices.
In this study, the efficacy of seven chelating agents for the removal of Hg from 
renal slices has been examined. Rabbits were injected with HgCl2 (10 mg/kg) and 3
h later kidneys were sliced, or renal slices were exposed in vitro to a mildly
toxic concentration of HgCl2 (5 x 10(-5)M, 4 h). The slices were then treated in 
vitro with 10 mM concentrations of EDTA, lipoic acid (LA), penicillamine (PA),
glutathione (GSH), 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), DMSA, or DMPS. DMPS proved to be the
most effective in mobilizing Hg from in vivo or in vitro HgCl2-exposed renal
tissue ( > 85% of control after 3 h incubation). Relative efficacies for the
seven agents were DMPS > DMSA, PA > DTT, GSH > LA, EDTA. The use of renal slices 
appears to be a useful in vitro tool for assessing the efficacy of chelating
agents on mobilizing accumulated Hg from renal tissue.

Are younger children at highest risk of renal sequelae after pyelonephritis?

Benador D(1), Benador N, Slosman D, Mermillod B, Girardin E.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatrics, Cantonal University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland.

Comment in
    Lancet. 1997 Feb 22;349(9051):576.

BACKGROUND: The general belief about the relation between risk of renal sequelae 
after pyelonephritis and age is that infants are at highest risk and children
older than 5 years at lower risk. This assumption has led to differences in
treatment based on age. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the 
occurrence of renal lesions in children aged 0-16 years.
METHODS: Between May, 1994, and January, 1996, all children aged 0-16 years who
were admitted to our department with a diagnosis of probable pyelonephritis and a
positive urine culture were included in this prospective study. All patients
received antibiotics for 7-21 days. During the acute phase of urinary-tract
infection, scintigraphy with technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and
ultrasonography were done. Voiding cystourethrography was undertaken at least 6
weeks after the end of antibiotic treatment. When scintigraphy showed renal
parenchymal lesions, repeat scintigraphy was done after at least 2 months to
assess the progression of renal lesions. For the analysis, children were grouped 
by age according to presumed risk of renal sequelae after pyelonephritis: high
risk (< 1 year), moderate risk (1-5 years), low risk (> 5 years).
FINDINGS: 201 patients were enrolled in the study (119 < 1 year, 47 aged 1-5
years, 35 > 5 years). During the acute phase of urinary-tract infection, renal
lesions were found in 66 (55%) infants under 1 year, in 37 (79%) children aged
1-5 years, and in 24 (69%) children older than 5 years. Of these 127 children,
108 underwent repeat scintigraphy after an average of 3 months (50 < 1 year, 36
aged 1-5 years, 22 > 5 years). Overall, renal scars were found on repeat
scintigraphy in 20 (40%) infants under 1 year, in 31 (86%) children aged 1-5
years, and in 14 (64%) children older than 5 years. 38 (36%) of these 65 patients
had vesicoureteric reflux. Among 88 children who had a first documented
urinary-tract infection and underwent repeat scintigraphy, renal scars were found
in 20 (43%) under 1 year, in 26 (84%) aged 1-5 years, and in eight (80%) older
than 5 years.
INTERPRETATION: This study did not confirm the conventional view that the risk of
renal scars after pyelonephritis diminishes with age. We believe that all
children, irrespective of age, will benefit from any measure that prevents the
development of renal sequelae.

An experimental study was planned to evaluate 99mTc-citrate, 67Ga-citrate and
99mTc(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) as agents for the visualization of acute 
appendicitis. Appendiceal ligation was performed through a midline incision in 24
rabbits. Twenty-four hours later the animals were divided into three equal
groups. The rabbits were injected through the aurical vein with 1 mCi (37 MBq)
99mTc-citrate in group I, 0.5 mCi (18.5 MBq) 67Ga-citrate in group II and 1 mCi
(37 MBq) 99mTc(V) DMSA in group III. After 3 h, static images of the rabbits were
obtained with a gamma camera. There were positive images in seven, six and five
rabbits in groups I, II and III respectively. The image quality was better in
group I than in the other groups. Also, the mean uptake in group I was
significantly higher than those of other two groups (P < 0.05). There was no
significant difference between groups II and III (P > 0.05). All rabbits had
appendicitis confirmed histologically. In conclusion, these results show that
99mTc-citrate is preferable to 67Ga-citrate and 99mTc(V) DMSA for the
differential diagnosis of acute abdominal inflammations such as appendicitis,
because of higher concentration ratios, simple and rapid preparation, low cost,
excretion mainly through the kidneys and fast blood clearance.

Previous studies of the intraoperative use of a hand-held gamma probe to localize
metastases and primary tumors of colorectal cancer have shown improved assessment
of tumor spread and changes in surgical management based on added information
gained by radioimmunoguided surgery. Following the injection of 180 MBq
[111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-pentetreotide and/or 500 MBq 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(both for dual-radionuclide scintigraphy) preoperative somatostatin receptor
imaging [11 patients with GEP tumors] and dual-radionuclide scintigraphy. (8
patients with relapsing medullary thyroid carcinomas) was performed. One patient 
with a metastasizing pheochromocytoma underwent 123]-MIBg scintigraphy. Results
were combined with the information obtained from conventional imaging modalities.
Intraoperative radiodetection was performed 24 hours after administration of
[111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-pentetreotide or 4 hours following the injection of
99mTc(V)DMSA using a hand-held gamma probe (Tec Probe 2000. Stratec, FRG).
Intraoperative gamma counting localized 39 somatostatin receptor positive lesions
of GEP tumors whereas preoperative receptor imaging visualized 81%, surgical
palpation 41% and radiological imaging modalities localized only 31%. In 8
patients with recurrent medullary thyroid carcinoma the surgeon was successful in
localizing and removing 18 tumor lesions by the help of the gamma probe.
Dual-radionuclide scintigraphy revealed 77% (Octreoscan 5/18; 99mTc-V-DMSA 9/18),
surgical palpation 55% and conventional imaging methods (CT, sonography) only 38%
of all lesions detected intraoperatively by the hand-held gamma probe. In
summary, this preliminary data show that intraoperative hand-held gamma probe
detection of microscopic and occult endocrine tumors is feasible and more
sensitive than external scintigraphy and conventional imaging.

Comparative inhibition of yeast glutathione reductase by arsenicals and
arsenothiols.

Tri(gamma-glutamylcysteinylglycinyl)trithioarsenite (AsIII(GS)3) is formed in
cells and is a more potent mixed-type inhibitor of the reduction of glutathione
disulfide (GSSG) by yeast glutathione (GSH) reductase than either arsenite
(AsIII) or GSH. The present work examines the effects of valence and complexation
of arsenicals with GSH or L-cysteine (Cys) upon potency as competitive inhibitors
of the reduction of GSH disulfide (GSSG) by yeast GSH reductase. Trivalent
arsenicals were more potent inhibitors than their pentavalent analogs, and
methylated trivalent arsenicals were more potent inhibitors than was inorganic
trivalent As. Complexation of either inorganic trivalent As or methylarsonous
diiodide (CH3As(III)I2) with Cys or GSH produced inhibitors of GSH reductase that
were severalfold more potent than the parent arsenicals. In contrast,
dimethylarsinous iodide ((CH3)2As(III)I) was a more potent inhibitor than its
complexes with either GSH or Cys. Complexes of CH3AsIII with GSH (CH3-AsIII(GS)2)
or with Cys (CH3AsIII(Cys)2) were the most potent inhibitors, with Ki's of 0.009 
and 0.018 mM, respectively. Inhibition of GSH reductase by arsenicals or
arsenothiols was prevented by addition of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
to a mixture of enzyme, GSSG, and inhibitor before addition of NADPH. DMSA added 
to the reaction mixture after NADPH reversed inhibition by (CH3)2As(III)I but had
little effect on inhibition by CH3As(III)I2, Ch3AsIII(GS)2, CH3AsIII(Cys)2, or
AsIII(GS)3. Partial redox inactivation of the enzyme with NADPH increased the
inhibitory potency of CH3As(III)I2 and (CH3)2As(III)I and changed the mode of
inhibition for CH3As(III)I2 from competitive to noncompetitive. The greater
potency of methylated trivalent arsenicals and arsenothiols than of inorganic
trivalent As suggests that biomethylation of As could yield species that inhibit 
reduction of GSSG and alter the redox status of cells.

Pentavalent 99mTc DMSA: uptake into a variety of human rhabdomyosarcoma
xenografts.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia.

BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyosarcoma is a common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood. While 
Ga is currently the most accurate modality for imaging residual or recurrent
tumour its dosimetry is unfavourable. Pentavalent 99mTc DMSA [99mTc (V) DMSA] has
been shown to accumulate in this tumour in a limited number of clinical cases.
METHODS: Biodistribution of 99mTc (V) DMSA was determined in non-tumour bearing
BALB-C mice. Operative specimens from four clinically 67Ga avid tumours were
xenografted into nude mice and allowed to reach a significant size.
Biodistribution studies were performed after the injection of 99mTc (V) DMSA in
all animals and 125I HSA and 67Ga in a limited number of animals.
RESULTS: None of the tumours investigated demonstrated significant 99mTc (V) DMSA
accumulation. Biodistribution was identical in tumour and non-tumour bearing
animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Rhabdomyo-sarcoma xenografts do not demonstrate significant uptake
of 99mTc (V) DMSA.

99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99Tcm-DMSA) planar and single photon emission
tomographic images from 100 children were reviewed to analyse whether linear
defects corresponding to anatomical characteristics of interrenuncular septum
(IRS) could be seen. Thirty sites in 30 kidneys (20 right, 10 left) from 27
patients were determined as showing IRS. They were seen less frequently in
patients less than 7 years of age. The prevalence of IRS in the patients with
vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) was not significantly different from that in the
patients without VUR. The interrenuncular septum was never seen on planar images 
and was most clearly demonstrated on conventional coronal tomographic images. The
linear defects ascribed to IRS on 99Tcm-DMSA scintigrams were of a similar
incidence to that reported previously. However, IRS is still an unestablished
structure, and there is no evidence that these linear defects actually correspond
to the structure described as the interrenuncular septum.

The efficiency of racemic-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (rac-DMSA) compared with
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (meso-DMSA) in mobilizing inorganic mercury was 
evaluated in female rats. Chelators were administered orally at a dose of 0.5,
1.0 or 2.0 mmol kg-1 on four consecutive days, 5 days after a single
intraperitoneal 203Hg injection (with 0.5 mg HgCl2 kg-1). Both chelators reduced 
203Hg retention in whole body and kidney and at higher doses also in the liver.
Racemic-DMSA was more efficient at lower dose levels and equal to meso-DMSA at
the highest dose level. Kidney retention decreased after rac-DMSA to 27, 10 and
10% of controls and after meso-DMSA to 68, 39 and 10% of control values at the
0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mmol kg-1 dose level, respectively. Since meso-DMSA is already
approved for human use, its stereoisomeric form, rac-DMSA, deserves further
attention for treatment of mercury poisoning.

Thiol compounds inhibit mercury-induced immunological and immunopathological
alterations in susceptible mice.

Author information:

In vitro mercury induces a high proliferative response in splenic lymphocytes and
in vivo it induces a systemic autoimmune disease in susceptible mouse strains.
This disease is characterized by increased serum levels of IgE and IgG1
antibodies, by the production of anti-nucleolar antibodies and by the formation
of renal immune complex deposits. We have previously found that the presence of
2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) inhibited mercury-induced cell proliferation in vitro.
In this study, we tested the effects of four other thiol compounds, namely
dithiothreitol (DTT), L-cysteine, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (meso-DMSA)
and 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid, Na salt (DMPS) on mercury-induced
immunological changes both in vitro and in vivo. We found that in vitro, the
addition of all thiol compounds abrogated mercury-induced cell aggregation and
proliferation. In vivo, injection of meso-DMSA and/or DMPS (s.c. or i.p.)
immediately following exposure to mercury markedly decreased IgG1 synthesis in
spleen cells and serum IgE levels in mercury-susceptible SJL mice. Treatment with
DMPS also prevented mercury-induced IgG1 anti-nucleolar antibody synthesis and
the development of mesangial IgG1 immune complex deposits in SJL mice.

Urinary tract infections in young febrile children.

Hoberman A(1), Wald ER.

(1)Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. alejo+@pitt.edu

UTI is a common and important clinical problem in infants and young children,
with a prevalence of 5.3% among febrile infants seen in our Emergency Department.
White females with rectal temperature > or = 39 degrees C are at particularly
high risk (prevalence, 17%). Several studies have highlighted the limitations of 
the standard urinalysis for identifying UTI in infants and young children and
have recommended performance of both urinalysis and urine culture. Alternative
methods such as dipstick urinalysis, although attractive because of ease of
performance, are inadequate as a screen for UTI. Hemocytometer WBC counts of an
uncentrifuged urine specimen can be performed in an office or hospital-based
laboratory with minimal training. Performance of Gram-stained smears, however, is
most appropriate for the hospital-based laboratory. In the hospital setting where
both tests can readily be performed, the positive predictive value of the
combination of pyuria and bacteriuria (85%) allows prompt institution of
antimicrobial therapy before culture results are available, whereas the lower
positive predictive value of the single finding of either pyuria or bacteriuria
(40%) justifies delaying treatment decisions until culture results are available.
In the office setting where hemocytometer counts can easily be performed,
culturing only specimens with pyuria and those of children presumptively treated 
with antimicrobials will result in the identification of almost all patients with
true UTI, sparing large health care expenditures. Although the urine culture is
traditionally regarded as the gold standard of UTI, positive urine cultures may
occur secondary to contamination or in cases of ABU, leading to a false diagnosis
of UTI. In contrast we found pyuria to be a reliable marker to discriminate
infection from colonization of the urinary tract. The sustained absence of an
inflammatory response, on repeat UA within 24 h, constitutes strong evidence that
infection is absent. Management of ABU is controversial; many experts recommend
withholding antibiotics because eradication of low virulence organisms may be
followed by colonization with more virulent species that cause pyelonephritis.
Preliminary results of our ongoing treatment trial suggest that management of
young febrile children with UTI as outpatients receiving oral cefixime is as
efficacious as inpatient management with intravenous cefotaxime. Results of renal
ultrasound and DMSA scan at the time of infection have not modified management in
any patient. Accordingly selective rather than routine performance of ultrasound 
is recommended. A voiding cystourethrogram at 1 month and a DMSA scan 6 months
later have been valuable in identifying patients with vesicoureteral reflux and
renal scarring, respectively. Among patients initially identified as having acute
pyelonephritis, the incidence of renal scarring at 6 months has been
substantially more frequent (approximately 40%) than we had expected. However,
the long term implications of small scars identified with renal scintigraphy
remain to be determined.

Differentiating histologic malignancy of primary brain tumors: pentavalent
technetium-99m-DMSA.

Hirano T(1), Otake H, Shibasaki T, Tamura M, Endo K.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Gunma University, School of Medicine, Japan.

This study assessed pentavalent 99mTc-DMSA uptake in primary brain tumors and
evaluated the relationship between retention and histologic malignancy.METHODS:
SPECT images of the brain were obtained at 30 min and 3 hr after intravenous
administration of approximately 555 MBq 99mTc(V)-DMSA in patients with brain
tumors. Sixty studies were performed in 57 patients and 63 lesions were
demonstrated: 11 glioblastomas, 13 anaplastic astrocytomas (Grade 3), 11
astrocytomas (Grade 2), 18 meningiomas and 10 schwannomas. Uptake ratios,
retention ratio and retention index were calculated and compared with tumor
histology and malignancy grade.
RESULTS: Approximately 95% of both benign and malignant primary brain tumors were
demonstrated by 99mTc(V)-DMSA SPECT images. False negative was noted in three
cases. The early uptake ratios were closely related to the tumor vascularity but 
had no statistically significant difference in the tumor histology or histologic 
malignancy. The delayed uptake ratio, retention ratio and retention index were
higher in the malignant tumors than the benign tumors.
CONCLUSION: Technetium-99m(V)-DMSA washout from the tumor was highly dependent
upon its histology and histologic malignancy. The delayed uptake ratio
considerably reflected tumor histology and differentiated benign tumors from
malignant tumors. The retention ratio and retention index significantly reflected
tumor histology and histologic grade of primary brain tumors and clearly
distinguished between benign and malignant tumors with statistically significant 
difference (p < 0.05). These results could suggest the clinical utility of
99mTc(V)-DMSA in imaging primary brain tumors and differentiating their
histological malignancy grade noninvasively.

Biochemical and immunotoxicological alterations following repeated gallium
arsenide exposure and their recoveries by meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and
2,3-dimercaptopropane 1-sulfonate administration in rats.

Efficacy of two analogues of British anti-lewisite (BAL),
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 2,3-dimercaptopropane 1-suffonate
(DMPS), in depleting arsenic and gallium concentration of blood and other soft
tissues, in restoring altered blood, liver and renal biochemical variables and
some immunlogical indices were investigated in male rats exposed to multiple
doses of gallium arsenide (GaAs). The results indicate that exposure to gallium
arsenide produced a significant inhibition of blood δ-aminolevulinic acid
dehydratase (ALAD) activity, an increase in urinary ALA excretion and blood zinc 
protoporphyrin level. Blood glutathione (GSH) contents also decreased on GaAs
exposure. No influence of GaAs however, on serum transminase activity or hepatic 
GSH contents was noticed, although, renal alkaline phosphatase activity decreased
significantly on GaAs exposure. Further, a marked influence of GaAs
administration on immunological variables like relative thymus and spleen weight,
spleen cellularity, antibody forming cell (AFC) response to sheep RBC and delayed
type of hypersensitivity (DTH) was observed. These data indicate that multiple
exposure to GaAs may produce an adverse effect on the haematopoietic, renal and
immune system. Further, post exposure treatment with two thiols,
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropane 1-sulfonate
(DMPS), DMPS proved more effective than DMSA in producing an effective reversal
of altered immunological variables and reducing arsenic concentration of spleen, 
liver, kidney and blood. Biochemical variables, on the other hand, responded less
favorably to the treatment of DMSA or DMPS except for a significant recovery in
the activity of blood δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) following DMSA
administration. The results suggest that DMPS could be an effective chelating
drug for reversing most of the GaAs induced immunological alterations and
reducing tissue arsenic burden.

Natal, South Africa.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in infancy and childhood has received scant
attention at primary health care (PHC) level, rarely featuring as one of the
common diseases. In a prospective study conducted at a PHC clinic, 16 of 94
children (17%) from whom urine was collected by strict aseptic catheterization
had bacteriuria (BU). Twelve of these had associated leucocyturia (> 5 WBC/HPF). 
The median age of those with BU was 9 months (range 1-30 months). BU rarely
occurred in isolation (6%), but was most often detected in association with acute
respiratory infection (43%) and acute diarrhoea (19%). No association of BU with 
mild malnutrition was detected in the 50% of children who were underweight for
age. Gram-negative pathogens accounted for 14 cases (87.5%). These pathogens were
resistant to commonly recommended antibiotics for UTI. Only five cases of BU
returned for follow-up at 3 months; no abnormalities were detected on repeat
catheter urine samples, urinary tract ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrogram
and DMSA studies in them. From these and other findings we conclude that BU is
probably often present in young children with common diseases attending PHC
centres in developing countries. Further studies are required to establish
exactly the role these pathogens play in the pathogenesis of UTI.

Comment in
    J Pediatr. 1996 Dec;129(6):785-7.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether age, C-reactive protein
(CRP), body temperature, or results of voiding cystourethrography at diagnosis of
first-time symptomatic urinary tract infection could predict the risk of renal
damage as evaluated by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy performed 1
year after the infection.
DESIGN: The study included 157 children (median age, 0.4 year, range, 5 days to
5.8 years) with first-time symptomatic urinary tract infection. In children 1
year of age or older, a body temperature of 38.5 degrees C or higher was
necessary for inclusion. CRP and body temperature were measured at the time of
infection, and voiding cystourethrography was performed shortly thereafter. DMSA 
scintigraphy was performed 1 year later in all children.
RESULTS: After 1 year, 59 (38%) of the 157 children had renal damage as evaluated
by DMSA scintigraphy, and of these, 28 (47%) had reflux. There was a positive
correlation between renal damage and CRP, body temperature, and reflux. Children 
with high levels of CRP, high fever, and dilating reflux had a risk of renal
damage up to 10 times higher than children with normal or slightly elevated CRP
levels, no or mild fever, and no reflux.
CONCLUSION: CRP concentration and body temperature at the index infection, in
combination with the results of voiding cystourethrography, are useful in
classifying children at high and low risk of scintigraphic renal damage 1 year
after urinary tract infection.

In vitro and in vivo studies with pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic
acid.

Lam AS(1), Puncher MR, Blower PJ.

Author information: 
(1)Research School of Biosciences, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent CT2 7NJ, 
UK.

The purpose of this investigation was to characterise the in vivo chemistry and
binding mechanisms of technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid [99mTc(V)DMSA].
Biodistribution was studied in mice by frozen section whole-body autoradiography 
and microautoradiography in selected tissues. Binding to bone mineral analogues
was studied in vitro using various forms of calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite 
under varied conditions. Similar studies with 99mTc-hydroxymethylene
diphosphonate (HDP) were also carried out for comparison. The in vivo stability
of 99mTc(V)DMSA was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis
of blood and urine samples taken over 24 h from patients injected with the
tracer. Whole-body autoradiography shows that 99mTc(V)DMSA has highest affinity
for bone (cortical rather than medullary) in mice. Substantial uptake of the
tracer was also observed in the kidney (cytoplasm of cortical renal tubular
cells). No specific localisation was observed in the liver at either the
microscopic or the macroscopic level. While 99mTc-HDP bound strongly to calcium
phosphates under all conditions, 99mTc(V)DMSA binding was inhibited in the
presence of phosphate and was stronger at pH 6.0 than at pH 7. 4. In
non-phosphate buffers, however, the binding of 99mTc(V)DMSA remained high across 
the pH range 4-7.4. 99mTc(V)DMSA binds to calcium phosphates chemically
unaltered, and no radioactive species other than the three isomers of
99mTc(V)DMSA were detected in blood or urine samples taken from patients up to 24
h after injection. 99mTc(V)DMSA is stable in vivo, and no conversion of the
complex to other chemical species needs to be invoked to explain its uptake in
bone metastases or soft tissue tumour. Bone affinity may be due to reversible
binding of the unaltered complex to the mineral phase of bone.

Evaluation of 99mtechnetium-radiopharmaceutical binding to blood elements using
different trichloroacetic acid concentrations.

Secure determination of the binding of 99mTc-radiopharmaceuticals to plasma (P)
and blood cell (BC) constituents can help to understand the biodistribution of
radiophamaceuticals. The reported precipitation studies of blood with
radiopharmaceuticals have shown that the results can not be easily compared
between studies. We decided to determine the "gold standard" concentration of
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to evaluate the binding to blood elements for several 
radiopharmaceuticals used in routine nuclear medicine. We have studied phytic
(99mTc-PHY), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic (99mTc-DTPA), glucoheptonic
(99mTc-GHA) and dimercaptosuccinic (99mTc-DMSA) acids. Blood was incubated with
radiopharmaceuticals, centrifuged and P and BC separated. Samples of P and BC
were also precipitated with TCA concentrations (20.0, 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1
percent) and soluble (SF) and insoluble fractions (IF) were isolated. The percent
radioactivity (percent rad) in IF-P depends on TCA concentration. It varied from 
36.4 to 65.0 (99mTc-PHY), from 17.9 to 32.0 (99mTc-DTPA), from 11.5 to 38.8
(99mTc-GHA) and from 52.8 to 66.2 (99mTc-DMSA). The results for the binding of
99mTc-PHY to IF-P show that there was no differences in the percent rad when TCA 
concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 percent were used. For 99mTc-DTPA, 5.0 percent is
the best TCA concentration. For 99mTc-GHA, low values of percent rad bound to
IF-P is found with TCA concentrations of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0. Interestingly, with
99mTc-DMSA, high values of bound radioactivity are not dependent on TCA
concentrations (0.1 to 10.0). Radioactivity in IF-BC depends on TCA concentration
and it varied for 99mTc-PHY (80.1 to 54.1) and for 99mTc-GHA (85.5 to 61.7). With
99mTc-DTPA and with 99mTc-DMSA the percent rad in IF-BC seems independent of TCA 
concentration. We suggest that the evaluation of the binding of the various
99mTc-radiopharmaceuticals to blood constituents, using only one TCA
concentration, should be avoided.

The present study evaluated 99mTc(V) DMSA as an agent for the visualization of
inflammatory lesions in comparison to 99mTc(III) DMSA and 99mTC-HIG. All three
radiopharmaceuticals were prepared with commercial kits. 99mTc(V) DMSA was
prepared at neutral pH by the addition of first bicarbonate and then
pertechnetate to the kit contents. The labeling efficiency was 99% as determined 
by ITLC. Abscesses were induced by i.m. injection of 50 microliters turpentine
into the right thighs of 36 Swiss albino mice. Six days later 3.7 MBq of each
radiopharmaceutical was i.v. administered to 12 mice. The mice were sacrificed at
1, 3, 6 and 24 h later. Scintigrams were obtained with a gamma camera. The
abscesses were better visualized on scintigrams with 99mTc(V) DMSA compared to
99mTc(III) DMSA, starting at 1 h. The animals were dissected and the organs were 
removed, weighed and the radioactivity determined with a gamma counter. The
abscess to other tissue ratios were higher with 99mTc(V) DMSA than the other
radiopharmaceuticals. The max. abscess/muscle ratios were 9.46 +/- 3.20 (24 h),
4.19 +/- 1.39 (6 h) and 5.98 +/- 1.17 (24 h) and max. abscess/blood ratios were
6.22 +/- 1.41, 4.09 +/- 0.84 and 0.914 +/- 0.351 all at 24 h for 99mTc(V) DMSA,
99mTc(III) DMSA and 99mTc-HIG, respectively. Experimental arthritis was produced 
in New Zealand white rabbits by intra-articular injection of ovalbumin. Four days
later 37 MBq of 99mTc(V) DMSA and 99mTc-HIG were each i.v. administered to 3
rabbits. Scintigrams obtained at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h clearly demonstrated arthritic
joints. ROI's over arthritic joints were compared to contralateral normal joints 
(A/C). The max. A/C ratios were 2.10 +/- 0.31 (3 h) and 2.92 +/- 0.99 (24 h) for 
99mTc(V) DMSA and 99mTc-HIG, respectively. Our results indicated the feasibility 
of imaging inflammatory lesions with 99mTc(V) DMSA.

The use of Chelex resin for the synthesis of radioactive lead complexes has been 
explored. The process involved immobilization of 203Pb on the resin and
subsequent elution of complexed lead by chelating agents. 203Pb complexes derived
from meso- and racemic dimercaptosuccinic acid (meso-DMSA, rac-DMSA) were
prepared and assessed for stability in vitro.

We propose a renal imaging agent, the 99mTc complex of the bidentate-N,S chelate 
N-(mercaptoacetyl)glycine (99mTc-2GAM), with the imaging characteristics of
99mTc-DMSA but a faster kidney uptake; chemical evidence supports the formulation
of 99mTc-2GAM as [Tc(v)(O)(GAM)2]-. After biodistribution and toxicity studies in
animals, 99mTc-2GAM was evaluated in five normal volunteers. 99mTc-2GAM is
rapidly cleared from the blood (t1/2 = 9 min) and 50% of the ID is excreted in
the urine in the first 2 h. Dynamic data show a rapid renal uptake that increases
up to 1 h with no significant wash-out between 1 and 8 h. The uptake in each
kidney ranges from 11.3% to 20.7% ID. Low, stable liver uptake is observed. No
significant activity is detected in other organs. We showed no differences
between 99mTc-2GAM and 99mTc-DMSA compared in three patients with unilateral
kidney disease. We conclude that 99mTc-2GAM has good practical and dosimetric
features for renal imaging.

[Renal function in children with reflux nephropathy followed up more than 10
years after disappearance of vesicoureteral reflux: usefulness of alpha
1-microglobulin as a marker to predict the prognosis of these children].

BACKGROUND: Although reflux nephropathy (RN) is one of the most important causes 
of renal failure in adolescence and young adulthood, we have no appropriate
markers to know the future course of children with RN. In order to find out
useful marker to predict the prognosis of these children, we analyzed the result 
of over ten years follow-up of children with RN.
METHODS: We evaluated renal function in 25 patients (aged between 11 years and 23
years, 14 males and 11 females) with RN using urinary alpha 1-microglobulin
(alpha 1 m), urinary albumin and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan.
All patients were followed up more than 10 years after disappearance of
vesicoureteral reflux.
RESULTS: Of 25 patients, 13 showed high levels of urinary alpha 1 m (> 4.4 mg/gCr
= upper normal limit) during follow-up period. Among them, renal dysfunction
developed in 9 on DMSA renal scan and/or serum creatinin (Cr) level. Before
puberty, all patients, even children with renal dysfunction (serum Cr > 1.0
mg/dl), remained in normal or slight high urinary albumin levels. Five cases,
showed high levels of urinary alpha 1 m before puberty, demonstrated a remarkable
increase of urinary albumin levels after puberty.
CONCLUSION: From these results, it was suggested that urinary levels of alpha 1 m
could be utilized as a marker to predict the prognosis of children with RN.

Effect of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid on nephrosclerosis in the Dahl rat. I. Role
of reactive oxygen species.

2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), a sulfhydryl-containing chelator, has
previously been shown to reduce mean blood pressure in lead-treated rats. In the 
present study we have demonstrated that DMSA (0.5% for 5 days every 2 weeks) also
reduces mean blood pressure in the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat. Six-week-old
Dahl SS and salt resistant (SR) rats were placed on a 0.3% NaCl diet for two
weeks, followed by an 8% NaCl diet for four weeks. Eight SS and 8 SR rats
remained untreated while 8 SS and 8 SR rats were treated with DMSA. DMSA
treatment ameliorated the mean blood pressure rise in the Dahl SS rats (141 +/- 5
vs. 120 +/- 4 mm Hg at 6 weeks, P < 0.001). Nephrosclerosis was severe in
untreated SS rats but absent in treated SS rats as well as in both treated and
untreated SR rats. Reactive oxygen species formation, as assessed by kidney
cortex content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and immunohistochemical demonstration of 
nitrotyrosine (a byproduct of peroxynitrite) in interlobular arteries, was
increased in Dahl SS rats, but abolished by DMSA (MDA 9.65 +/- 0.33 nmol/g wet
wt, untreated SS, vs. 6.46 +/- 0.51, treated SS, P < 0.001). The
anti-nephrosclerotic action of DMSA was clearly disproportionate to the reduction
in blood pressure. We conclude that the effect of DMSA was related instead to the
reactive oxygen species scavenging properties of the thiol groups.

Consequences of removal of a molybdenum ligand (DmsA-Ser-176) of Escherichia coli
dimethyl sulfoxide reductase.

Canada. joel.weiner@ualberta.ca

We have used site-directed mutagenesis and EPR spectroscopy to examine the
consequences of altering the molybdenum ligand in Escherichia coli dimethyl
sulfoxide (Me2SO) reductase (DmsABC). Mutagenesis of DmsA-Ser-176 to Ala, Cys, or
His abolishes both respiratory growth on Me2SO and in vitro benzyl viologen:Me2SO
oxidoreductase activity. EPR spectroscopy reveals changes in the line shape and
the gav of the Mo(V) signals of the S176A and S176C enzymes. The midpoint
potentials (Em,7) of the Mo(VI)/Mo(V) and Mo(V)/Mo(IV) couples in DmsABC are -15 
and -175 mV. The Em,7 of the Mo(V)/Mo(IV) couple in the S176A mutant is 35 mV;
however, the Mo(V) species could not be further oxidized with ferricyanide.
Titration of the S176C mutant produced several overlapping Mo(V) species
occurring at Eh > -150 mV, suggesting heterogeneity in the molybdenum
environment. A Mo(V) spectrum was not visible in S176H membranes poised between
-435 to 350 mV or oxidized with 200 microM ferricyanide. No differences were
detected in the EPR spectra of the reduced [4Fe-4S] clusters of DmsABC and the
S176A and S176H mutant enzymes; however, the S176C mutation altered the EPR line 
shape of one of the reduced [4Fe-4S] clusters.

DNA elements and protein factors involved in the transcription of the beta
2-adrenergic receptor gene in rat liver. The negative regulatory role of C/EBP
alpha.

Jiang L(1), Gao B, Kunos G.

(1)Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia
Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298, USA.

Primer extension and RNase protection analyses of the rat beta 2-adrenergic
receptor (beta 2AR) gene identify two transcription start points at -64 and -220 
nt, respectively. Transient transfections of putative promoter/pCAT constructs
into DDT1 MF-2 cells indicate that fragments -36 to -100 (PI) and -186 to -312
(P2) are sufficient to promote transcription, whereas -911 to -1122 contains a
negative regulatory element(s). RNase protection analysis of the 3' untranslated 
region (3'-UTR) indicates the presence of two transcripts with 3'-UTR of 111 and 
604 nt exclusive of the poly(A+) tails. Northern blots of beta 2AR mRNA using
full-length and partial cDNA probes indicate that a major 2.2 kb and a minor 1.6 
kb species arise from the use of alternative promoters as well as different
polyadenylation signals. DNase I footprinting and DNA mobility shift assays
(DMSA) using rat liver nuclear extracts identify a number of transcription
factors binding to sequence elements within or upstream from P1 and P2, including
Spl, CRE, CPl, AP-2, NF-1, NF-kappa B, and C/EBP. Supershift assays using
antibodies against C/EBP alpha and C/EBP beta and mutational analyses indicate
that the protein binding to the C/EBP consensus recognition site at -925 to -933 
is C/EBP alpha. The activity of promoter/CAT constructs containing the C/EBP
recognition site is significantly decreased by cotransfection of C/EBP alpha but 
not C/EBP alpha but not C/EBP beta into either DDT1 MF-2 cells or primary rat
hepatocytes. Partial hepatectomy causes a transient decrease in C/EBP alpha, as
measured by DMSA, and an increase in beta 2 AR mRNA levels and rate of
transcription in the remnant liver. Thus, derepression via C/EBP alpha is likely 
involved in the up-regulation of beta 2AR in the regenerating rat liver.

99Tcm-DMSA renal scintigraphy for acute pyelonephritis in adults: planar and/or
SPET imaging?

Everaert H(1), Flamen P, Franken PR, Peeters P, Bossuyt A, Piepsz A.

Brussels, Belgium.

A number of authors have indicated a more sensitive detection of renal cortical
defects using single photon emission tomography (SPET) compared with planar
imaging when performing 99Tcm-dimer-captosuccinic acid (99Tcm-DMSA) renal
scintigraphy. The place of SPET in the evaluation of kidneys in adults suspected 
of acute pyelonephritis (APN) remains controversial, however. The aim of this
study was to address the role of SPET in adult patients suspected of having APN. 
Planar and SPET 99Tcm-DMSA renal imaging was performed in 53 patients. The data
sets were separated and presented in random order to three independent observers.
The kidneys were divided into three segments, which were classified as normal,
definitely abnormal or equivocal. Ir. a second step, the number of lesions
(definite or equivocal) on planar and SPET imaging were counted. The overall
concordance between the planar and SPET imaging scores was 90.9, 89.9 and 87.7%
for the three observers, respectively. Inter-observer discordance was recorded in
a small percentage of both planar and SPET images. The number of lesions, based
on the average of the three observers, was 22 for planar and 25 for SPET imaging.
Obvious differences between observers were noted. The planar images were more
often interpreted as equivocal by the least experienced observer. The more
experienced observers gained limited additional information using SPET routinely.
Most equivocal lesions on the planar scintigrams were observed in the lower
segment. For SPET, no such distribution was noted. High-quality 99Tcm-DMSA images
allow the detection of the same number of lesions as SPET in adults suspected of 
APN.

Comment in
    J Nucl Med. 1997 Sep;38(9):1501.

The purpose of this study was to directly compare the sensitivity and specificity
of SPECT and pinhole imaging for the detection of acute pyelonephritis using
histology as the standard of reference.METHODS: Bilateral vesicoureteral reflux
of infected urine was induced in 16 piglets (32 kidneys) by unroofing the
intravesical ureter and subsequently instilling a broth culture of E. coli into
the bladder. DMSA scans were obtained by both pinhole and SPECT techniques at 24 
hr (4 piglets), 48 hr (5 piglets), 72 hr (4 piglets) and 10 days (3 piglets)
after instillation of bacteria into the bladder. Kidneys were harvested
immediately after scintigraphy for histopathologic examination. Results of the
SPECT images, pinhole images and histologic findings were interpreted
independently in a blinded fashion. The images of each kidney were classified as 
positive or negative for pyelonephritis regardless of the severity and number of 
lesions. To evaluate accuracy of SPECT and pinhole imaging for the detection of
individual lesions, each kidney was arbitrarily divided into three zones (upper, 
middle and lower). Image findings were then compared with the pathology results
for the presence or absence of pyelonephritis in each zone.
RESULTS: Histopathology revealed pyelonephritis in 24 of 32 kidneys (58 of 96
zones). The sensitivity of the DMSA scan for detection of affected kidneys was
92% for SPECT and 83% for pinhole; overall accuracy was 88% for both. The
sensitivity of SPECT for the detection of affected renal zones was slightly
better than pinhole imaging (91% compared with 86%), but its specificity was
lower (82% compared with 95%) resulting in a similar accuracy. Excluding four
piglets where scans were obtained within 24 hr after instillation of bacteria
into the bladder, the sensitivity of SPECT and pinhole for the detection of
affected kidneys were 95% and 90%, respectively. Their overall accuracy were 96% 
and 92%. In this subgroup, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of SPECT for
the detection of involved zones were 96%, 95% and 96%, respectively. The
corresponding values for pinhole imaging were 90%, 95% and 92%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although the sensitivity of SPECT for the detection of acute
pyelonephritis is slightly better than pinhole DMSA scan, the overall accuracy of
these two imaging techniques is essentially the same.

Radionuclide scanning with tumour-seeking agents such as pentavalent
technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid [99mTc(V)-DMSA], thallium-201 and
technetium-99m sestamibi (MIBI) has been reported to be useful in the detection
of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). We undertook a study in 14 MTC patients to 
determine the comparative imaging potential of 201Tl, MIBI and 99mTc(V)-DMSA in
the detection of recurrent or metastatic MTC. All patients underwent total
thyroidectomy and had persistently elevated serum calcitonin levels after the
surgery. Scintigraphic studies were carried out 20 min after the injection of 111
MBq of 201Tl or 555 MBq of MIBI and 2 h following the injection of 370 MBq of
99mTc(V)-DMSA. All scintigraphic findings were correlated with contemporaneous CT
or MRI studies. CT, MRI and bone scans showed 42 (26 bone, 16 soft tissue)
metastatic sites in 11 of the 14 patients. In the remaining three patients no
lesions were detected during diagnostic evaluation. 99mTc(V)-DMSA showed all of
the soft tissue metastases but could not show two bone lesions. On the other
hand, MIBI imaging was false-negative in 22 (52%) sites and 201Tl was
false-negative in 34 (80%) sites. Overall, lesion detection sensitivities for
99mTc(V)-DMSA, MIBI and 201Tl were 95%, 47% and 19% respectively. We conclude
that 99mTc(V)-DMSA is clearly superior to MIBI and 201Tl in the follow-up of MTC 
patients.

In France, radiopharmaceuticals have been considered as drugs since 1992. Few
adverse reactions with radiopharmaceuticals were described in the literature.
Some authors have reported a rate of 1 to 6 reactions per 100,000 injections. The
purpose of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of
radiopharmaceutical-induced side effects. A prospective survey was performed from
November 1993 to May 1995 (during 18 months) in the Department of Nuclear
Medicine of the University Hospital in Toulouse. There were 14,794 injections of 
radiopharmaceuticals (99mTc-phytate, 99mTc-microspheres of serum albumin,
99mTc-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA), 99mTc-hydroxymethyldiphosphonate (HMDP),
99Tc-colloid, 99mTc, 99mTc-sestamibi, Thallium-201). Three side effects were
reported: one case of necrosis at the injection site, one case of vomiting and
one case of dizziness. All the cases occurred with Tc99m-pyrophosphate. According
to the WHO definition, the first side effect was classified as 'serious'. The
causal relationship was unlikely for the first and second case and probable for
the third. The outcome of these side effects was always favorable.

The valuation of renal function using radiotracers represents an attractive
methodology to value most renal and upper urinary tract diseases in newborns.
Restrincting damage, lower irradiation and lack of dangerous side-effect are
particularly desiderable in newborns. The radiotracers of choice in our studies
were Tc-99m-labeled radiopharmaceutical (DTPA and DMSA), because of their
favourable dosimetry. The given dose has been calculated according to the table
set forth by the EAMN-Pediatric Task Group. We report some particular cases in
which renal scintigraphy represented a good alternative in comparison with more
injurious methods in diagnostic classification of newborns.

Tc(V)-99m DMS, developed by Yokoyama et al. in 1981, has been recognized to be
advantageous for the scintigraphic diagnosis of various malignant tumors and
their metastasis, the aim of this study is to assess the in-vitro stability of
Tc(V)-99m DMS. Thin-layer chromatography, including paper chromatography and
silica gel thin layer chromatography, is performed to determine the change of
radiochemical species presented in the reconstituted solution of Tc(V)-99m DMS
prepared from the DMS kit (Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, Atomic Energy
Council R.O.C.) and the commercial DMSA kit (Nephroscint, IRE CELLTARG
Radiopharmaceuticals Japan). The bioscan imaging scanner is used to measure the
Rf value and labeling efficiency of radiochemical species on the chromatographic 
strip. The in-vitro stability of Tc(V)-99m DMS prepared from the DMS kit and the 
commercial DMSA kit is studied by examining various parameters which include
temperature(degree C) and time(hr) after reconstitution. The results show that
the in-vitro stability of Tc(V)-99m DMS prepared from the DMS kit is actually
better than that from the commercial DMSA kit. The one-step labeling method of
DMS kit is much simpler than the two-step labeling method of DMSA kit.

Identification of sulfate starvation-regulated genes in Escherichia coli: a gene 
cluster involved in the utilization of taurine as a sulfur source.

Genes whose expression is regulated by sulfate starvation in Escherichia coli
were identified by generating random translational lacZ fusions in the chromosome
with the lambda placMu9 system. Nine lacZ fusion strains which expressed
beta-galactosidase after growth under sulfate starvation conditions but not after
growth in the presence of sulfate were found. These included two strains with
insertions in the dmsA and rhsD genes, respectively, and seven strains in which
the insertions were located within a 1.8-kb region downstream of hemB at 8.5
minutes on the E. coli chromosome. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of this
region indicated the presence of four open reading frames designated tauABCD.
Disruption of these genes resulted in the loss of the ability to utilize taurine 
(2-aminoethanesulfonate) as a source of sulfur but did not affect the utilization
of a range of other aliphatic sulfonates as sulfur sources. The TauA protein
contained a putative signal peptide for transport into the periplasm; the TauB
and TauC proteins showed sequence similarity to ATP-binding proteins and membrane
proteins, respectively, of ABC-type transport systems; and the TauD protein was
related in sequence to a dichlorophenoxyacetic acid dioxygenase. We therefore
suggest that the proteins encoded by tauABC constitute an uptake system for
taurine and that the product of tauD is involved in the oxygenolytic release of
sulfite from taurine. The transcription initiation site was detected 26 to 27 bp 
upstream of the translational start site of tauA. Expression of the tauD gene was
dependent on CysB, the transcriptional activator of the cysteine regulon.

Radionuclide studies in the evaluation of urinary tract infections.

Jaya G(1), Bal CS, Padhy AK, Bandopadhyaya GP, Pattnayak SK, Malathi KE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Safdarjang Hospital, New Delhi.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and renal
scarring in children presenting with culture proven urinary tract infections
(UTI).
DESIGN: Descriptive study.
SETTING: Tertiary care hospital-based study.
SUBJECTS: Thirty-two children with proven UTI were evaluated by means of an
abdominal ultrasonogram (USG), Technetium-99m Dimercapto Succinic Acid (DMSA)
scan and Direct Radionuclide Cystography (DRCG). A micturating cystourethrogram
(MCU) was performed to rule out any structural abnormality and to grade VUR.
RESULTS: A total of 64 renal units in 32 children were evaluated. DMSA scan
showed scarring in 27 renal units (42.2%) in 16 patients. Bilateral renal
scarring was more common in older (> 2 yr) children as compared to younger ones
(89% Vs 43%; p < 0.05). USG detected abnormalities in 13 renal units (20.3%) in 7
cases. VUR was detected in 37.5% of children of all age group by DRCG. In
contrast, MCU showed evidence of VUR in only 13/20 renal units with a sensitivity
of 65% as compared to DRCG and did not pick up any additional VUR that could have
been missed on the DRCG. Only 3/9 in < 2 yr, in contrast to 10/11 in > 2 yr were 
positive for VUR on MCU (p < 0.05). However, MCU detected evidence of cystitis in
3 children and a bladder diverticulum in one patient.
CONCLUSION: Wherever available, DMSA scan should be considered as a part of the
first line investigations in any patient presenting with UTI. DRCG can also be
performed in the same sitting to screen for the presence of reflux particularly

Survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, treated with an array of
antioxidants.

Between 1983 and 1988 we treated 36 patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) by an array of antioxidants and added other drugs to the regimen 
whenever a patient reported deterioration. Our customary prescription sequence
was N-acetylcysteine (NAC); vitamins C and E; N-acetylmethionine (NAM); and
dithiothreitol (DTT) or its isomer dithioerythritol (DTE). Patients with a
history of heavy exposure to metal were also given meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA). NAC, NAM, DTT, and DTE were administered by subcutaneous injection
or by mouth or by both routes, the other vitamins and DMSA by mouth alone. The
hospital pharmacy supplied NAC and NAM injections fluid as 100 ml bottles of 5.0 
and 5.85% solutions, respectively. DTT was delivered in special double-walled
capsules of 200 mg. DTT/DTE injection fluid was added to the NAC and NAM bottles,
the final DTT/DTE concentrations never exceeding 0.5%. DMSA was provided in 250
mg capsules. All of the 36 patients used NAC and DTT/DTE; 29 also used vitamins C
and E; 21 also used NAM; and 7 also used DMSA, DMSA, NAM, vitamins C and E were
tolerated well. In many patients, DTT, DTE, NAC and NAM induced pain, redness and
swelling at the injection sites in that order of decreasing frequency. DTT and
DTE did often and NAC did sometimes cause gastric pain, nausea and other
abdominal discomfort. Comparison of survival in the treated group and in a cohort
of untreated historical controls, disclosed a median survival of 3.4 years (95%
confidence interval: 3.0-4.2) in the treated and of 2.8 (95% confidence interval 
2.2-3.1) years in the control patients. This difference may be explained by
self-selection of our highly motivated treated group and by its initial survival 
of diagnosis for an average of 8.5 months before onset of treatment. We conclude 
that antioxidants neither seem to harm ALS patients, nor do they seem to prolong 
survival.

DMSA renal scans in adults with acute pyelonephritis.

Bailey RR(1), Lynn KL, Robson RA, Smith AH, Maling TM, Turner JG.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nephrology, Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand.

The 99mTc-DMSA scan is accepted as the most sensitive imaging modality for
detecting areas of renal parenchymal scarring. More recently the DMSA scan has
also been shown to be of value in imaging areas of renal parenchymal involvement 
in both children and adults with acute pyelonephritis. We assessed the acute DMSA
scan findings in a consecutive series of 81 patients hospitalized with acute
pyelonephritis. Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed if the patient had a fever of 
> 37.8 degrees C, loin pain or tenderness and infected urine (99% Escherichia
coli). Patients had a blood culture taken (8 positive), as well as a
hematological (leukocytosis 75%) and biochemical screen, C-reactive protein (CRP)
(increased in 57 of 66 [86%]) and urinary tract ultrasonography. If the initial
DMSA scan was abnormal it was repeated after three months and in some instances
again at six months. If persisting defects were noted an intravenous urogram was 
then undertaken. Of the 81 patients, 37 (46%) had an abnormality on the DMSA
scan. Nineteen had a single defect, 12 multifocal defects, five features
suggestive of pre-existing renal parenchymal scarring (all later shown to have
reflux nephropathy) and one a shrunken kidney. Those patients with an abnormal
scan had a higher CRP concentration than those with a normal scan. Of the 31
patients who had either a focal or multifocal defect on their initial DMSA scan
there was adequate follow-up on 24 patients. In 18 of these the defects had
resolved by six months (usually within three months), while of the remainder,
three were shown to have reflux nephropathy, one had a large single renal cyst
and another an area of parenchymal calcification. Fifty-three of 76 patients
(70%) had normal ultrasonography. In adults with acute pyelonephritis, the DMSA
scan may prove to be the most useful renal imaging procedure.

Technetium-99m-DMSA renal SPECT in diagnosing and monitoring pediatric acute
pyelonephritis.

Yen TC(1), Chen WP, Chang SL, Liu RS, Yeh SH, Lin CY.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, National
Yang-Ming University, Taiwan.

This study compares the sensitivity of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal
SPECT with planar scintigraphy, concluding the importance of 99mTc-DMSA renal
SPECT for the early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) in patients under 3
yr of age.METHODS: Twenty-seven children under 3 yr of age, with clinical and/or 
laboratory suspicion of APN, were investigated. All 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT and
planar images and voiding cystoureterogram (VCUG) were obtained within 3 days of 
hospitalization.
RESULTS: In the first examination, renal cortical defects were detected in 23
patients (42 kidneys) with SPECT and in 9 patients (11 kidneys) with planar
scintigraphy. One year after treatment, constant renal cortical lesions were
observed in 11 patients (14 kidneys) with SPECT and 4 patients (4 kidneys) with
planar scintigraphy. The high grades of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (grade >or=
3) correlate better with APN diagnosed by SPECT (34 kidneys) than by planar
scintigraphy (8 kidneys). Multiple renal cortical defects (number of lesions >or=
4) were only seen in patients under 1.5 yr old and none of those with a negative 
99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT had a positive 99mTc-DMSA renal planar scintigraphy at any
time. There is a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the diagnostic ability
of these two methods of examination.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT should be used, where
possible, instead of planar DMSA in routine examination of children with clinical
suspicion of APN, especially for those under 3 yr of age.

Renal technetium-99m-DMSA SPECT in normal volunteers.

De Sadeleer C(1), Bossuyt A, Goes E, Piepsz A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Brussels, Belgium.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy today is considered a sensitive
and useful technique for the detection of cortical abnormalities. Recent studies 
have suggested that lesion detection can be improved by SPECT imaging. This study
investigated normal kidneys using different SPECT modalities.METHODS: Ten young, 
healthy volunteers with normal clinical history and normal renal ultrasound
underwent planar and SPECT DMSA imaging 2 to 4 hr after intravenous injection of 
99mTc-DMSA (185 MBq). Analysis of SPECT data was focused on the homogeneity of
cortical uptake (comparison of upper and lower pole activity) as well as on the
presence or absence of focal cortical defects.
RESULTS: No abnormality could be observed on the planar images. SPECT revealed,
in seven kidneys (five left and two right), the presence of a hypoactive upper
pole. This was visually observed on the coronal slices with up to 35% difference 
between upper and lower pole. Moreover, three focal cortical defects were
visualized on the coronal slices as well as on three-dimensional surface shade
displays.
CONCLUSION: These normal patterns should be recognized when evaluating a patient 
with possible renal involvement.

Radiation dosimetry of technetium-99m-DMSA in children.

Smith T(1), Evans K, Lythgoe MF, Anderson PJ, Gordon I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Physics and Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for 
Children NHS Trust, London.

Radiation dosimetry was performed on 24 children (aged 5 wk to 14.8 yr) who were 
undergoing routine diagnostic investigation of renal impairment with
99mTc-DMSA.METHODS: Organ doses were calculated using MIRDOSE 3 with biokinetic
data obtained in previously described studies, and effective doses and effective 
dose equivalents were estimated. Interpolation by inverse weight between
pediatric anthropomorphic phantoms was compared with age-matching to discrete
phantoms. Administered activities were scaled by body surface area from the adult
activity of 100 MBq and the resulting radiation doses in normal children were
compared with those that would have resulted from a schedule based on body
weight.
RESULTS: The effective doses estimated by interpolation differed by up to 46%
from those based on discrete phantoms and showed less variation. In children with
normal bilateral renal function, the mean effective dose per administered
activity was 0.91 +/- 0.08 mSv or 0.98 +/- 0.29 mSv by the two methods,
respectively. Renal pathology reduced the effective dose, on average, by 15% of
the value for normal patients.
CONCLUSION: Over the pediatric age range, the uniformity of effective dose values
was improved by scaling the administered activity according to body surface area 
rather than to body weight.

Biokinetic behavior of technetium-99m-DMSA in children.

Evans K(1), Lythgoe MF, Anderson PJ, Smith T, Gordon I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Physics, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS
Trust, London, United Kingdom.

After intravenous administration of 99mTc-DMSA, biokinetic data were collected
from studies on 24 children aged from 5 wk to 14.8 yr (15 normal and 9 with renal
pathology).METHODS: Patients were imaged with a gamma camera up to 30 hr
postinjection and the absolute activities in the kidneys, liver, spleen, bladder,
knees and whole body were estimated using an attenuation-corrected conjugate
counting technique. Renal uptake and elimination rates and urinary excretion of
radioactivity were also measured.
RESULTS: In children with normal renal function, maximal kidney uptake was 42.4% 
+/- 5.4% and was taken up with a half-time of 1.0 +/- 0.2 hr. Renal excretion
amounted to 18.0% +/- 4.4% at 24 hr and was lowest in children aged less than 1
yr. In children with abnormal renal function, apart from the expected reduction
in renal uptake there was evidence of wider variations in uptake rate and
increased urinary excretion. Mean uptakes in liver and spleen were approximately 
5% and 2%, respectively, in all patients and uptake in knees, assumed to reside
in the metaphyseal growth complexes, was 1.4%.
CONCLUSION: In children with normal renal function, there was little evidence of 
age-dependent biokinetic factors other than reduced urinary excretion and lower
uptake in knees in children aged less than 1 yr. The results therefore suggest
that a single biokinetic model may suffice for radiation dosimetry purposes in
normal children irrespective of age.

Febrile urinary tract infection in children: Role of 99MTc-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) scan and other imaging techniques.

Zaki M(1), Al-Mutari G, Al-Saleh Q, Ramadan DG.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Farwania Hospital and Sabah Hospital.

Fifty children (37 females and 13 males) with first febrile urinary tract
infections were studied to assess the value of 99MTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scan in detecting inflammatory changes of acute pyelonephritis (APN).
These findings were compared with renal ultrasonography (US). We also evaluated
the reliability of clinical and laboratory observations in diagnosing acute
pyelonephritis (APN). All children had micturating cystourethrography (MCUG).
DMSA-documented acute pyelonephritis was present in 29 (58%) patients. Only four 
children (8%) demonstrated changes suggestive of APN on renal ultrasonography.
Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was documented in 17 (47%) of the total group and in 
13 (45%) of those with abnormal DMSA scan. Follow-up DMSA scan in 15 children
with initial abnormal findings showed complete recovery in seven (47%). Our data 
have shown that DMSA renal scan is the most useful investigational procedure in
children with febrile UTI. The diagnosis of APN, depending on clinical and
laboratory data, is unreliable. Renal US alone can miss serious renal defects.
MCUG remains the most sensitive procedure to detect VUR and it should be
performed in all children with UTI and abbormal DMSA scan. Early detection of
acute pyelonephritis allows the prompt introduction of antimicrobial agents in
those children and can prevent or decrease renal damage and its complications.

[Prenatal diagnosis of malformative uropathies: multicentric retrospective study 
and a proposed feto-neonatal diagnostic protocol].

[Article in Italian]

Pavanello L(1), Pitter M.

Author information:

We have wanted to appraise the diagnostic reliability of fetal ultrasonography
(FU) and its correlation with postnatal ultrasonography (PU). For two years we
have studied 20.506 children born in 12 Pediatric Division of Veneto, all
provided with FU. Between the 23rd and the 40th week of gestation the FU has
individualized 177 fetuses with pelvic dilatation. The PU, performed in the 2nd
and 7th day of life and then repeated to 1 month of life, has confirmed the
prenatal diagnosis in 150 of the 247 renal unities, we have observed the 39% of
false positive and the 8% of false negative. The sensibility has been 94%,
specificity of 46%. The definitive diagnosis was: mild pelvic ectasia in 45%,
ureteropelvic junction stenosis in 26%, vescicoureteric reflux in 15%,
duplication of the renal collecting system and primary megaureter in 3%,
multicystic kidneys and urethral valves in 5%. 20 children have been submitted to
surgical corrective intervention. From the correlation performed between the
entity of pelvic dilatation to the FU and to the PU we think it advisable to
submit all the fetuses that show a caliceal dilation of > 5 mm to two
ultrasounds, the first one between the 2nd-5th day of life and the second one at 
30 days of life. In the newborn with caliceal dilatation of > 10 mm a micturating
cystogram must be performed and subsequently in case of vescico ureteric reflux a
DMSA scan is advisable, while in absence of reflux a DTPA scan or MAG3 scan is
necessary. The renal pelvis with a diameter between 5-10 mm will perform
ultrasound controls only each three months, unless there are partial or total
reductions of the renal parenchymal, dilatation of the calices and/or the
ureters.

OBJECTIVES: Crossed renal ectopia is an uncommon congenital anomaly with little
or no clinical repercussion. An empty renal fossa is not an infrequent ultrasound
finding and an anomalous contralateral ectopic kidney can be seen occasionally.
METHODS/RESULTS: We report on three clinical cases with an empty renal fossa
detected by ultrasound. Scintiscanning with 99mTc DMSA permitted precise
diagnosis of the existing malformation.
CONCLUSIONS: 99mTc DMSA permits precise diagnosis of the empty renal fossa, type 
of malformation, functional status of the ectopic kidney and the status of its
parenchyma.

Comparative effects of chelating agents on pulmonary toxicity of systemic nickel 
in mice.

University, Japan.

N-Benzyl-D-glucaminedithiocarbamate (BGD), diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC),
dihydroxyethyldithiocarbamate (DHED), trans-1,2-cyclohexanediamine
N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (CDTA) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
were studied for their protective effects against the pulmonary toxicity in mice 
induced by acute exposure to nickel. Nickel injection increased lipid
peroxidation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and the concentrations of
protein, phospholipids (PL) and essential metals such as Ca, Fe and Zn and
decreased the reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration and alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) activity in the lungs. At 30 min after Ni treatment, DMSA, BGD and DDTC
effectively depressed Ni concentration in the lungs. At 24 h after Ni treatment, 
DMSA and BGD were effective in mobilizing Ni from the lungs. Both DMSA and BGD
significantly prevented increases in lipid peroxidation and in the concentrations
of PL, Ca, Fe and Zn, and decreases in GSH concentration and ALP activity in the 
lungs of mice caused by Ni injection. Treatment with DMSA or BGD was more
effective than that with other chelating agents in decreasing the pulmonary Ni
concentration and preventing other changes caused by acute exposure to Ni,
resulting in effective protection against Ni-induced pulmonary damage.

    Nucl Med Commun. 1996 Dec;17(12):1072.

The early identification of renal cortical scarring secondary to urinary reflux
and/or renal infection is important in the management of patients with recurrent 
disease. Scintigraphic imaging of the renal cortex using 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) is often considered the standard method for the diagnosis of renal
scars in both adults and children. Consistent reporting of 99Tcm-DMSA is
nevertheless essential in ensuring that the clinician can act on the data
reported. In this study, seven experienced observers were asked to report,
independently, 99Tcm-DMSA data sets from 32 patients. The observers were asked to
note the presence of a space occupying lesion or of a renal cortical scar(s) and 
to conclude if the kidney was normal or abnormal. There was marked variation in
the number of renal cortical scars reported, the total number of scars seen and
whether or not the kidney was normal or abnormal. After peer review of all data, 
consensus and referenced criteria were arrived at for a reanalysis of data. All
scans were reread by the observers. There was some improvement in the concordant 
reporting of kidneys with renal scars (51 vs 61%) and whether or not the kidney
was normal or abnormal (53 vs 63%). However, this was not statistically
significant (at a level of P < 0.05). This study demonstrated significant
inter-observer variation regarding the reporting of 99Tcm-DMSA studies. A
consensus with agreed guidelines for data interpretation did not significantly
affect this apparent lack of consistency of reporting.

Chelation in metal intoxication. XXXVIII: Effect of structurally different
chelating agents in treatment of nickel intoxication in rat.

Tandon SK(1), Singh S, Jain VK, Prasad S.

Author information: 
(1)Chemical Toxicology, Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, Lucknow, India.

Some structurally different chelating agents viz. alpha-mercapto-beta-(2-furyl)
acrylic acid (MFA), alpha-mercapto-beta-(2-thienyl) acrylic acid (MTA), meso
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS),
diethyl dithiocarbamate (DE-DTC), and N-benzyl-D-glucamine dithiocarbamate
(NBG-DTC) were evaluated for their efficacy to mobilized nickel and reverse some 
nickel-induced biochemical alterations in experimental nickel intoxication. MFA, 
DMSA, and NBG-DTC appear more effective than their corresponding homologs, MTA,
DMPS and DE-DTC, respectively, in enhancing urinary and fecal excretion of nickel
and lowering tissue burden of nickel in nickel preexposed rats. These,
particularly NBG-DTC, appear promising in the treatment of nickel (II) poisoning.
However, there seems no definite relationship between the structure of the
chelating agents examined and their ability to counteract the effects of nickel.

Comment in
    J Urol. 1997 Jul;158(1):187.

PURPOSE: We compared the prognostic stratification of primary vesicoureteral
reflux by performing staging voiding cystourethrography in all children with a
urinary tract infection or only in those with renal scarring on
99mtechnetium-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Staging voiding cystourethrography and DMSA scintigraphy
were performed in 105 children with a urinary tract infection and reflux
persistence was assessed by radionuclide cystography after a 2-year followup.
RESULTS: Staging voiding cystourethrography revealed no reflux in 51 children
(DMSA positive in 3), grades I to II reflux in 21 (DMSA positive in 6) and grade 
III reflux in 33 (DMSA positive in 19). On followup radionuclide cystography no
new reflux was detected, and it was no longer demonstrated in 23 children (8 with
grade III and 15 with grades I to II reflux). The finding of grade III reflux on 
staging voiding cystourethrography had a 76% positive and a 92% negative value
for predicting persistent reflux with an 87% predictive accuracy. Limiting the
evaluation of voiding cystourethrography data to the 28 children with a positive 
DMSA scan the combination of renal scarring and grade III reflux had an 84%
positive and an 83% negative predictive value with 83% accuracy. This approach
would have prevented 77 children from having to undergo voiding
cystourethrography.
CONCLUSIONS: Performance of staging voiding cystourethrography exclusively in
children with renal scarring on a DMSA scan resulted in predictive accuracy that 
was close to what was achieved by performing voiding cystourethrography in all
children with a urinary tract infection. To be able to limit cystourethrography
to a select population could prove to be cost-effective.

Technetium-99m-DMSA studies in pediatric urinary infection.

Clarke SE(1), Smellie JM, Prescod N, Gurney S, West DJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Guy's Hospital, London, England.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common condition in children and may lead to
renal scarring with a risk of later hypertension and renal insufficiency. We made
a cross-sectional study of the 99mTc-DMSA findings in 496 children referred for
following symptomatic UTI to a Department of Nuclear Medicine and we categorized 
the results, to provide a framework for further study.METHOD: A standard
99mTc-DMSA protocol was used to study 496 children (157 males, 339 females) aged 
from birth to 14 yr. Findings were classified according to the image appearance
and relative function of each kidney. These were related to age, sex, history and
timing of UTI and the results on micturating cysto-urethrography (MCU).
RESULTS: Images were normal, with function within limits (45%-50% in one kidney),
in approximately half the boys and girls studied. The other images were
classified as equivocal in 68 children, abnormal unilaterally in 105 and
bilaterally in 76, and they were subdivided according to the image appearance. No
image changes could be identified that were specifically associated with acute
UTI. Diffuse change alone was uncommon. A high proportion of abnormal images was 
found in infant boys, older girls with recurrent UTI and those children with
vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). Of the bilateral abnormal images, 98% were seen in 
children with VUR.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that infective renal change may be superimposed 
on underlying congenital lesions (perhaps detectable antenatally) or may be
acquired following UTI in the presence of reflux and are thus potentially
preventable. This study also suggests that VUR is almost certain to have occurred
in a child who has bilateral abnormal 99mTc-DMSA images following UTI and is also
commonly present in those with definite unilateral defects.

Pharmacological prevention of acute lead poisoning in Paramecium.

Bernal J(1), Ruvalcaba S.

Author information: 
(1)Departamento de Medicina, Universidad Autńoma de Aguascalientes, México.

To understand how lead (Pb2+) and other metals and chelating agents effect living
cells, behavioral experiments in the marine ciliate Paramecium calkinsi were
carried out. The duration of Backward Swimming Behavior (BSB) of Paramecium was
partially reduced when cells were exposed to 100 microM of Ni2+, CD2+ and Co2+.
In contrast, Pb2+ increased Paramecium BSB in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, 1,
10, 20, 50 and 100 microM of Pb2+ increased the duration of BSB by 20.4, 83.9,
143.2, 163.2 and 185.2%, respectively. The naphthalenesulphonamide W-7, a calcium
channel blocker in lower organisms, abolished the increase of Paramecium BSB
initially produced by Pb2+. Paramecium, poisoned with 10 MicroM of Pb2+, were
also treated with putative Pb2+ chelating agents, such as
meso-2-3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), Ca-Na2-EDTA and ascorbic acid. These
compounds inhibited the increase of the duration of BSB initially produced by
Pb2+ in a dose-dependent manner. The potency of these antidotes in blocking the
effects of Pb2+ was as follows: DMSA >> Ca-Na2-EDTA > ascorbic acid. These
results provide evidence for a membrane-based mechanism of lead poisoning and
support the use of DMSA as a lead antidote.

[Renal scintigraphy: a major test for urologic diseases in children].

[Article in French]

Bonnin F, Lottmann H.

The number of asymptomatic uropathies detected by ultrasound has increased
dramatically with antenatal diagnosis. Some of them only threaten the renal
parenchyma and require surgery. Therefore, screening for patients at risk is a
major challenge. During the initial evaluation and follow up of a dilated system,
MAG3 scans evaluate and quantify the physiologic significance of a radiologically
detected anatomic abnormality by measuring the relative renal function and wash
out of the radiopharmaceutical. Moreover, DMSA scans show renal functional
abnormalities due to pyelonephritis or dysplasia associated with vesicoureteral
reflux or obstructive uropathy. With a low radiation burden, renal scintigraphy
is now a major imaging modality for uropathies in pediatrics.

Hepatic lipid peroxidation, glutathione and phospholipid contents of homogenate
prepared from the liver of lead-intoxicated male rats treated with 0.3 m mol/kg
CaNa2EDTA and DMSA for 8 weeks, either alone or in combination, were
investigated. A significant increase in hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and a
reduction in glutathione levels was noticed. While a marginal decrease in
phosphatidyl choline (PC) level was noticed, no effect on phospholipid contents
was seen. Treatment with all the three chelating agents elicited decrease in PC
level. DMSA alone was partially effective in restoring lead-induced altered
hepatic glutathione and MDA levels. Combined treatment may have an adverse
effects on hepatic tissue and does not seem to produce immediate recoveries in
the lead-induced hepatic damage.

We investigated the effect of chelating agent meso-2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) on spatial learning and forced-swim immobility in Binghamton Heterogeneous
Stock (HET) mice. Forced-swim immobility (characterized by increasingly frequent 
bouts of complete motionlessness in a forced-swim test, i.e., behavioral despair)
is reduced by exposure to lead. In Experiment 1, male and female HETs (n = 81)
were assigned to lead-exposed (0.5% lead acetate ad lib in drinking fluid),
pair-fed (PF), or water control groups. Six weeks after the termination of lead
exposure, half of each group was injected intraperitoneally (IP) with 50 mg/kg
DMSA or vehicle once per day for 5 days. Following treatment, all animals were
tested for acquisition and extinction in the Morris Water maze, followed by
immobility testing in an inescapable forced-swim task. Neither Pb nor DMSA
affected Morris maze performance. However, consistent with previously published
work, Pb reduced immobility in the forced-water swim relative to both PF and
water controls. Additionally, lead-exposed males, but not females, showed
sustained improvement following DMSA treatment on immobility measures. Experiment
2 was designed to demonstrate the effect of the above DMSA protocol on blood-Pb, 
and also examined the immediate effects of DMSA on immobility during treatment.
Thus, in Experiment 2, animals were exposed to an identical Pb and DMSA treatment
protocol, but the effects of DMSA on immobility during the course of DMSA
treatment were measured, and animals were sacrificed immediately after treatment 
so that blood-Pb measures could be taken. Under these circumstances, DMSA
markedly reversed the lead-induced reduction in immobility immediately during the
treatment phase. Although DMSA clearly reduced blood-lead in males, its influence
on female blood levels was far less. Taken together, the data from these
experiments suggest that DMSA ameliorates lead-induced immobility changes in
mice, but that gender may modulate DMSA's effect on blood-lead and longer-term
behavioral effects. However, further work is needed to clarify the role of gender
in response to DMSA.

Early 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in symptomatic first-time
urinary tract infection.

Sweden.

During a 2 year period, 175 children below 6 years of age (median 0.4 year) with 
non-obstructive symptomatic urinary tract infection were studied by 99mTc
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. DMSA scintigraphy was performed at a
median of 10 days after the start of treatment and was abnormal in 73 children
(42%), equivocal in 29 (16%) and normal in 73 (42%). Reflux was seen in 27% of
all children and in 38% of the renal units that were abnormal at DMSA
scintigraphy. A decreasing frequency of abnormalities at DMSA scintigraphy was
seen within the first 14 days after the start of treatment. C-reactive protein
and grade of reflux correlated significantly with abnormal DMSA studies. To
demonstrate renal involvement in acute urinary tract infection, DMSA scintigraphy
should be performed within days after the start of treatment. It is noteworthy
that reflux was seen in less than half of renal units with abnormal DMSA
scintigraphy.

Poor renal uptake of 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid and near-normal
99mtechnetium-mercaptoacetyltriglycine renogram in nephronophthisis.

Hecht H(1), Ohlsson J, Starck SA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, County Hospital Ryhov, Jönköping, Sweden.

Four patients with the clinical diagnosis of nephronophthisis are presented, all 
having a very poor renal uptake of 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc-DMSA) but clearly visualized kidneys on early images with
99mtechnetium-mercaptoacetyltriglycine and a normal or almost normal renogram.
There was no difference between a young patient in an early stage of the disease 
and the other three patients with more advanced renal disease. In contrast, a
patient with tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis had considerably better
renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA despite impaired renal function. We suggest that the
specific tubular function defect in nephronophthisis might be the cause of the
poor uptake of 99mTc-DMSA. We also recommend the method to support the clinical
suspicion of nephronophthisis, even in the early stages of the disease.

[Eighteen cases of multicystic kidney: natural history and renal function of the 
contralateral kidney].

[Article in Japanese]

Orikasa K(1), Konda R, Sakai K, Ota S, Orikasa S.

Author information:

PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to evaluate natural history of
multicystic kidney (MCK) and renal function of the contralateral kidney.
METHODS: We analyzed 18 children (7 boys and 11 girls) with unilateral MCK. The
sizes of cysts were investigated by ultrasonography. Urinary beta 2-microgloblin 
(beta 2 m), alpha 1-microgloblin (alpha 1 m) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase 
(NAG) and albumin were determined as markers of tubular and glomerular damage.
The renal function was evaluated by 99m Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99 m Tc-DMSA)
renal uptake rate.
RESULTS: Nephrectomy was performed in 2 children. In 14 (87.5%) of 16 cases who
were followed conservatively, the size of cysts was spontaneously reduced by 1-18
months (mean 6.4). Neither hypertension nor malignancy from the affected kidney
has been observed in follow-up periods of 6-63 months. One patient had minor
degree of contralateral ureteral dilatation which resolved spontaneously. Lower
DMSA uptake rate of contralateral kidney was demonstrated in 63% (10/16). Markers
of tubular damage were abnormally high in these patients.
CONCLUSION: From these results, the most appropriate management of MCK is
conservative with ultrasonic monitoring. Long-term follow-up testings with
special care on contralateral renal function will be necessary because the
overload to the contralateral healthy kidney may have already occurred during
infancy and cause focal glomerulosclerosis and renal failure in future.

Interaction of an engineered [3Fe-4S] cluster with a menaquinol binding site of
Escherichia coli DMSO reductase.

Rothery RA(1), Weiner JH.

Author information: 
(1)MRC Group in the molecular Biology of Membranes, Department of Biochemistry,
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

We have characterized by EPR the interaction of the Em,7 = -50 mV [4Fe-4S]
cluster of Escherichia coli DMSO reductase (DmsABC) with a menaquinol (MQH2)
binding site. Potentiometric titrations indicate that in DmsAB(C102S)C, the Em,7 
= -50 mV [4Fe-4S] cluster is replaced by an Em,7 = +260 mV [3Fe-4S] cluster. The 
Q-pool coupling assay in combination with the MQH2 analog HOQNO
(2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide) was used to examine the effect of the
DmsB(Cl02S) mutation on physiological electron transfer through DmsABC. Forward
electron transfer through the mutant (MQH2 to DmsA) is blocked in the Q-pool
coupling assay, but reverse electron transfer (DmsA to MQ) is not. HOQNO elicits 
a significant change in the EPR line shape of the oxidized DmsAB(Cl02S)C [3Fe-4S]
cluster but has no effect on the line shape of the reduced [4Fe-4S] clusters. We 
have identified a residue in DmsC involved in MQH2 oxidation. DmsC(H65), and in a
double mutant, DmsAB(C102S)C(H65R), the DmsC mutation blocks the HOQNO effect on 
the [3Fe-4S] EPR line shape, suggesting, that the DmsC(H65R) mutation either
blocks HOQNO binding or blocks a conformational link between a HOQNO binding site
and the DmsB(C102S) [3Fe-4S] cluster. These results suggest that the MQH2 binding
site of DmsC is conformationally and functionally linked to the Em,7 = -50 mV
[4Fe-4S] cluster of DmsB.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan in children with urinary tract infection.

Tsai TC(1), Huang FY, Yang CT, Shih BF.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.

The hospital records of 247 children less than 16 years old, who had had UTI and 
received dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans during the period October
1991 to October 1993, were reviewed. Abnormal DMSA renal scans were found in 207 
kidneys (207/494, 41.9%) and in 163 cases (163/247, 66%). The appearance of an
abnormal DMSA renal scan is correlated with fever and vesicoureteral reflux, but 
not with age or sex. Because the prevalence of upper UTI in children is high,
DMSA renal scan is undoubtedly a valuable tool for pediatricians as a guide in
giving appropriate antibiotic therapy and to prevent further renal damage.

No ideal imaging method is available for the diagnosis of MTC. Once the diagnosis
is suspected, serum calcitonin or CEA may help to confirm it. Often, multiple
studies are done, especially a combination of MR imaging or ultrasound and an
isotopic method. Tc(V)DMSA is an excellent agent but not readily available in the
United States. Indium-labeled pentreotide is probably the imaging agent of choice
in the United States.

A review of renal scarring in children.

MacKenzie JR(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Yorkhill, Glasgow, 
UK.

It is now widely accepted that children with a proven urinary tract infection
should undergo some form of diagnostic imaging to assess the presence of, or the 
potential to develop, renal scarring. The type of investigation which should be
performed is controversial. Some centres still perform intravenous urography,
others rely on ultrasound alone, while others believe that a
99Tc(m)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99Tc(m)-DMSA) scan is essential. This review
discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques by drawing from
the extensive literature currently available. The consensus view is that a DMSA
scan is the most sensitive method of detecting renal scarring and of highlighting
the kidney at risk of developing scarring. It is hoped that wider early use of
DMSA scintigraphy will lead to a fall in the number of children who develop
end-stage renal disease.

Stenosis of the ureteropelvic junction and obstructive megaureter are still a
diagnostic and therapeutic problems. So far, there is no reliable prognostic
factor to predict the outcome of a primary dilated upper urinary tract under the 
"wait and see" strategy and to decide which child must be operated upon and which
should not. In practice, basic diagnostic evaluation with sonography, possibly
i.v.-pyelography and voiding cystography is accompanied by quantifying
isotope-based procedures such as DMSA-uptake or diuretic renography. The Whitaker
test has become less important. Based on the investigation by Koff et al., it
seems to be possible to follow the "wait and see" procedure in more than 85% of
the children without any loss of renal function of the dilated kidney.

Center, Missouri 63110, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a method for assessing absolute renal function (as well as
morphology) in children, using gamma camera imaging of intravenously injected
technetium-99m (99mTc) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).
METHODS: Forty-five children (ages 1 week to 10 years; mean, 2.0 years) were
imaged using a planar technique in which not only the appearance but the absolute
amount of intravenously administered 99mTc DMSA taken up by the kidneys was
calculated for each child and compared with contemporaneous determinations of
creatinine clearance.
RESULTS: There was a close correlation between the absolute DMSA uptake and
creatinine clearance (r = 0.752).
CONCLUSIONS: Renal function in children, expressed as creatinine clearance, can
be accurately estimated by measuring absolute DMSA uptake with planar gamma
camera imaging using 99mTc DMSA.

Engineering a novel iron-sulfur cluster into the catalytic subunit of Escherichia
coli dimethyl-sulfoxide reductase.

Molecular Biology of Membranes, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2H7,
Canada.

Dimethyl-sulfoxide reductase (DmsABC) is a complex [Fe-S] molybdoenzyme that
contains four [4Fe-4S] clusters visible by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) 
spectroscopy. The enzyme contains four ferredoxin-like Cys groups in the electron
transfer subunit, DmsB, and an additional group of Cys residues in the catalytic 
subunit, DmsA. Mutagenesis of the second Cys, Cys-38, in the DmsA group to either
Ser or Ala promotes assembly of a fifth [Fe-S] cluster into the mutant enzyme.
The EPR spectra, the temperature dependences, and the microwave power dependences
demonstrate that the new clusters are [3Fe-4S] clusters. The [3Fe-4S] clusters in
both of the C38S and C38A mutant enzymes are relatively unstable in redox
titrations and have midpoint potentials of approximately 178 and 140 mV.
Mutagenesis of the DmsA Cys group to resemble a sequence capable of binding an
[4Fe-4S] cluster did not change the cluster type but reduced the amount of the
cluster present in this mutant enzyme. This report demonstrates that all four EPR
detectable [Fe-S] clusters in the wild-type enzyme are ligated by DmsB. Wild-type
DmsA does not ligate an [Fe-S] cluster that is visible by EPR spectroscopy.

The genes (dms) encoding the dimethylsulfoxide reductase protein complex have
been cloned and sequenced from Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) type b (Hib) strain
Eagan. The Hib dms genes are arranged as an operon whose genomic organization is 
similar to that of the Escherichia coli (Ec) dmsABC operon. The deduced Hib DmsA,
and DmsB and DmsC amino-acid sequences are highly homologous to their Ec
counterparts and nearly identical to the recently published sequences of the Hi
type-d strain Rd Dms proteins. Hi dimethylsulfoxide reductase appears to be a new
member of the superfamily of oxidoreductase enzymes.

Comparative evaluation of chelating agents on the mobilization of cadmium: a
mechanistic approach.

A comparative evaluation of chelating agents, namely, diethyl dithiocarbamate
(DDC), dimethyl dithiocarbamate (DMDC), 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane
(CYCLAM), 1,4,8,12-tetraazacyclopentadecane (TACPD), 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA), and 2,3-dimercapto-1-propane sulfonate (DMPS) was conducted to assess
their efficacy against acute cadmium (Cd) toxicity. DMSA and DMPS appeared to be 
most effective in reducing mortality as well as Cd burden of liver, kidneys, and 
brain in cadmium intoxicated mice. DMDC reduced Cd levels only in liver and
kidneys, while DDC significantly enhanced its level in brain. CYCLAM and TACPD
significantly increased the Cd level in liver and kidneys and were ineffective in
brain. The therapeutic index as well as therapeutic efficacy was highest for DMSA
followed by DMPS and DMDC. A fair degree of correlation was found to exist
between (1) stability constant of Cd chelates and percent survival (r = .438, (2)
stability constant and percent transport (r = .479), and (3) percent survival and
percent transport (r =.447). However, the lipophilicity did not show any
appreciable correlation with percent survival and stability constant of Cd
chelates.

Isolation of an oxygen-sensitive FNR protein of Escherichia coli: interaction at 
activator and repressor sites of FNR-controlled genes.

Melville SB(1), Gunsalus RP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of California,
Los Angeles 90095, USA.

The Escherichia coli fnr gene product, FNR, is a DNA binding protein that
regulates a large family of genes involved in cellular respiration and carbon
metabolism during conditions of anaerobic cell growth. FNR is believed to contain
a redox/O2-sensitive element for detecting the anaerobic state. To investigate
this process, a fnr mutant that encodes an altered FNR protein with three amino
acid substitutions in the N-terminal domain was constructed by site-directed
mutagenesis. In vivo, the mutant behaved like a wild-type strain under anaerobic 
conditions but had a 14-fold elevated level of transcriptional activation of a
reporter gene during aerobic cell growth. The altered fur gene was overexpressed 
in E. coli and the resultant FNR protein was purified to near homogeneity by
using anaerobic chromatography procedures. An in vitro Rsa I restriction site
protection assay was developed that allowed for the assessment of
oxygen-dependent DNA binding of the mutant FNR protein. The FNR protein was
purified as a monomer of M(r) 28,000 that contained nonheme iron at 2.05 +/- 0.34
mol of Fe per FNR monomer. In vitro DNase I protection studies were performed to 
establish the locations of the FNR-binding sites at the narG, narK, dmsA, and
hemA promoters that are regulated by either activation or repression of their
transcription. The sizes of the DNA footprints are consistent with the binding of
two monomers of FNR that protect the symmetrical FNR-recognition sequence
TTGAT-nnnnATCAA. Exposure of the FNR protein or protein-DNA complex to air for
even short periods of time (approximately 5 min) led to the complete loss of DNA 
protection at a consensus FNR recognition site. A model whereby the FNR protein
exists in the cell as a monomer that assembles on the DNA under anaerobic
conditions to form a dimer is discussed.

Alternative gene for biotin sulfoxide reduction in Escherichia coli K-12.

del Campillo Campbell A(1), Campbell A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Stanford University, CA 94305, USA.

A gene at 42 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome, identified as the locus of
pseudoreversion of knockout mutations in the biotin sulfoxide reductase gene,
bisC, has 64% base sequence identity with bisC. This makes it a member of a
multigene family of molybdopterin enzymes that includes genes for anaerobic
reduction of trimethylamine oxide (torA) and dimethylsulfoxide (dmsA). Disruption
of this gene eliminates the background activity of biotin sulfoxide reduction
observed in bisC mutants. Sequence comparison of the new gene (bisZ) with bisC
indicates that certain ts mutants of bisC arise by gene conversion between the
two loci.

(1)Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, National Naval Medical
Center, Bethesda, MD 20889, USA.

The dithiol chelating agents 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were evaluated for use as potential
adjuvants to reduce or prevent radiotoxicity in anti-interleukin-2 receptor
(IL-2R) Lead-212 or Bismuth-212 alpha-radioimmunotherapy. DMPS was less toxic
than DMSA to tumor cell lines in culture. No adverse effects on the ability of an
anti-IL-2R monoclonal antibody (MAb) to bind to its specific antigen were
detected using DMPS or DMSA at concentrations up to 600 ug/mL in 10% or 100%
mouse serum. After a 5-day oral administration of chelating agent, neither acute 
nor chronic toxicities on blood hematology, blood chemistry or organ weights were
observed for treated mice. DMPS and DMSA were effective in accelerating whole
body clearance of the gamma-emitting tracer Bismuth-206. Both chelates
significantly reduced femur uptake of tracer when compared to nontreated control 
mice. However, only DMPS prevented early (2 h postinjection) renal accumulation. 
These studies support the use of DMPS as a potential adjuvant chelation therapy
in Lead-212 or Bismuth-212 radioimmunotherapy protocols.

The authors describe the possible application of Tc-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy in 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. In consideration of the common embryonic origin
of these tumors and other neoplastic diseases (medullary thyroid carcinoma,
pheocromocytoma, neuroblastoma) that have been well studied with radionuclide
imaging, five cases of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (two insulinomas, one
vipoma, and two unclassified neuroendocrine tumors) were successfully visualized 
with Tc-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy, thus giving an overall "imaging confirmation" 
of the histologic and/or cytologic results in terms of primary and metastatic
localization. The authors point out the importance of their results, obtained in 
a simple and repeatable manner, and suggest a real comparison in this setting
between this approach and octreotide scintigraphy.

The use of chelating agents in occupational lead poisoning.

Porru S(1), Alessio L.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Occupational Health, University of Brescia, Italy.

Chelating agents have long been used in the pharmacological treatment of lead
poisoning, whose management is still a problem, particularly in developing
countries. This article reviews the pharmacological properties of dimercaprole,
peniclliamine. CaNa2EDTA and dimercaprosuccinic acid, examines their indications,
contraindications and side effects and discusses the possible use of each drug in
occupational Pb poisoning. Proposals are also presented for the treatment and
follow-up of subjects with signs and symptoms of poisoning and of subjects with
low-moderate Pb absorption. CaNa2EDTA seems to be the most reliable and safer
chelating agent nowadays available and with a wider spectrum of action. DMSA
seems to be promising in the treatment of occupational Pb poisoning. Even though 
there is no doubt that chelation therapy has significantly contributed to reduce 
mortality and morbidity from occupational Pb poisoning, the efficacy of this
treatment in subjects with subtle neurological or renal damage has not yet been
studied properly.

Urinary concentrations of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and interleukin-1
receptor antagonist (IL-lra) standardized to urinary creatinine concentrations
were studied. The median standardized IL-1 alpha creatinine quotient in children 
with first-time acute pyelonephritis was 3.6 pg/mumol, but was nondetectable in
children with recurrent pyelonephritis, children with non-renal febrile
conditions and children convalescent after acute pyelonephritis (p < 0.05-0.01). 
IL-lra levels were also significantly higher in children with acute first-time
pyelonephritis (median of 239 pg/mumol) compared to these three groups of
children (p < 0.01-0.001). The highest urinary IL-lra levels, however, were found
in the healthy controls (median value 1.019; p < 0.001). Both cytokines were
higher among children younger than one year compared to older children. The acute
IL-1 alpha creatinine quotients were lowest in children with uptake defects on
99mTC-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy both during the acute infection
(reflecting the acute inflammation) (p < 0.001) and 1 year after the acute
infection (reflecting permanent kidney scarring) (p < 0.001). In conclusion,
persisting high urinary levels of IL-1 alpha were associated with less renal
inflammation and scarring.

Effect of microaerophilic cell growth conditions on expression of the aerobic
(cyoABCDE and cydAB) and anaerobic (narGHJI, frdABCD, and dmsABC) respiratory
pathway genes in Escherichia coli.

Tseng CP(1), Albrecht J, Gunsalus RP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of California,
Los Angeles 90095, USA.

Escherichia coli varies the synthesis of many of its respiratory enzymes in
response to oxygen availability. These enzymes include cytochrome o oxidase
(cyoABCDE) and cytochrome d oxidase (cydAB), used during aerobic cell growth, and
a fumarate reductase (frdABCD), dimethyl sulfoxide/trimethylamine oxide reductase
(dmsABC), and nitrate reductase (narGHJI), used during anaerobic respiratory
conditions. To determine how different levels of oxygen affect the expression of 
each operon, strains containing cyo-lacZ, cyd-lacZ, frdA-lacZ, dmsA-lacZ, and
narG-lacZ fusions were grown in continuous culture at various degrees of air
saturation. The basal-level expression of the anaerobic respiratory genes,
frdABCD, dmsABC, and narGHJI, occurred when the air saturation of the medium was 
above 20%; as the saturation was reduced to below 10% (ca. 2% oxygen), the
expression rapidly increased and reached a maximal level at 0% air. In contrast, 
cyoABCDE gene expression was lowest under anaerobic conditions while cyd-lacZ
expression was about 40% of its maximum level. When the oxygen level was raised
into the microaerophilic range (ca. 7% air saturation) cyd-lacZ expression was
maximal while cyo-lacZ expression was elevated by about fivefold. As the air
level was raised to above 20% saturation, cyd-lacZ expression fell to a basal
level while cyo-lacZ expression was increased to its maximum level. The role of
the Fnr and ArcA regulatory proteins in this microaerophilic control of
respiratory gene expression was documented: whereas Fnr function as an
aerobic/anaerobic switch in the range of 0 to 10% air saturation, ArcA exerted
its control in the 10 to 20% range. These two transcriptional regulators
coordinate the hierarchial control of respiratory pathway gene expression in E.
coli to ensure the optimal use of oxygen in the cell environment.

[Study of children with urinary tract infections. Does intravenous urography play
any role?].

[Article in Danish]

Ninety children referred to hospital with urinary tract infections (UTI) were
investigated by intravenous urography (IVU), ultrasonography (US) and 99m-Tc
dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA). Fifty-eight children also had a micturition 
cystourethrography performed. In 36 (40%) of the children at least one result was
abnormal. In 29 children IVU was abnormal, 10 had abnormal US and 16 had abnormal
DMSA. Six of the 58 children had vesicoureteric reflux in eight kidneys. In 16
children IVU was the only examination with an abnormal result, and in ten of
these the findings were considered important for treatment or prognosis. In
conclusion, IVU is an important supplement to US and DMSA in investigation
programs for children with UTI. IVU should be performed in cases of renal
scarring or dilatation and in children with recurrent infections.

Assessment of the protective activity of monisoamyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate 
against methylmercury-induced maternal and embryo/fetal toxicity in mice.

Virgili University, Reus, Spain.

The protective activity of monoisoamyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (Mi-ADMS), a 
new monoester of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), on methylmercury-induced
maternal and developmental toxicity was assessed in mice. A series of four
Mi-ADMS injections was given s.c. at 0.25, 6, 24, and 48 h after oral
administration of 25 mg/kg of methylmercury chloride (MMC) given on day 10 of
gestation. Mi-ADMS effectiveness was tested at 0, 23.8, 47.6 and 95 mg/kg.
Cesarean sections were performed on gestation day 18. All live fetuses were
examined for external, internal, and skeletal abnormalities. Oral MMC
administration resulted in an increase in the number of resorptions, and a
decrease in fetal body weight, whereas the incidence of cleft palate,
micrognathia, and skeletal variations was also increased in the fetuses of the
MMC-treated groups. Although significant amelioration of MMC-induced
embryolethality by Mi-ADMS was not noted at any dose, MMC-induced fetotoxicity
was reduced by administration of this agent at 23.8, 47.6, and 95 mg/kg. However,
the intrinsic toxicity of Mi-ADMS would be a restrictive factor for the possible 
therapeutic use of this chelator in pregnant women exposed to organic mercury.

Vesico ureteric reflux and renal scarring in children with urinary tract
infection.

Hazza I(1), Wahadeneh A, Qudah E, Ahmad M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, King Hussein Medical Center, Amman, Jordan.

To evaluate the presence of vesico ureteric reflux (VUR) and renal scarring in
children with documented symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), and the
importance of age at time of presentation, we studied 29 patients with UTI.
Nineteen patients were females and 10 were males. Three patients were below one
year of age, 13 were between one and five years, and 13 were above five years.
None of the patients had systemic hypertension or renal insufficiency. All
patients had renal ultrasound and renal scintigraphy with dimercapto succinic
acid (DMSA). Micturating cystourethrogram was done in all children below age of
five, and in patients above age of five if renal scintigraphy showed evidence of 
scarring. Of the 29 UTI patients 10 (34%) had VUR. Of the patients with VUR,
seven were below age of five while three were above five. Renal scarring was
found in 3/7 patients with VUR below age of five years, but was in all patients
with VUR above age of five years. All patients with grade 3 and 4 reflux
nephropathy had renal scarring, while it was found in half of the patients with
grade 1 and 2 reflux. We conclude that in UTI patients VUR is not uncommon
finding, which needs further investigations and follow-up.

Comparison of rac- and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acids for chelation of mercury
and cadmium using chemical speciation models.

Fang X(1), Hua F, Fernando Q.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721, USA.

The formation constants of various mercury and cadmium chelates of the
stereoisomers of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) have been determined from
potentiometric titrations in the presence of the competing ligand EDTA. The
mercury chelates formed at pH 7.4 are the monomeric HgL of the DMSA
diastereoisomers and HHgL2 of rac-DMSA. Mercury is completely complexes at pH
greater than 3.0 in solutions containing more than 1 equiv of either rac- or
meso-DMSA. At high concentrations (10 microM and above) mercury tends to bind to 
a greater extent to rac- than to meso-DMSA. At pH 7.4, the predominant cadmium
meso-DMSA chelate species in solution is CdL, and HCdL is present at a much
smaller concentration. With rac-DMSA, however, the predominant cadmium chelate
species is HCdL at a low concentration of the ligand, and at a high concentration
of the ligand the species CdL2 predominates. Cadmium is completely chelated at pH
7.4 in solutions containing more than 1 equiv of either rac- or meso-DMSA. At pH 
around 5.5, which corresponds to the pH of the kidney, however, a significant
amount of free cadmium is present in solutions containing 1 equiv or less of
either DMSA stereoisomer. From the results of an analysis of speciation models,
probable kidney damage, that may result from free cadmium ion release in the
kidney during chelation therapy, is inferred when meso-DMSA is used for
mobilizing cadmium. In contrast, the release of free cadmium ion is negligible in
the pH range in the kidney when rac-DMSA is used. On the basis of the speciation 
models, rac-DMSA is found to be far superior to meso-DMSA in the treatment of
acute cadmium poisoning.

Increased inorganic mercury in spinal motor neurons following chelating agents.

Ewan KB(1), Pamphlett R.

Author information:

Australia.

Heavy metal toxicity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of motor neuron
diseases. In an attempt to assess the efficacy of chelating agents to remove
mercury from motor neurons, we quantitated the effect of the chelating agents
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 2,3- dimercaptopropane -1-sulphonate 
(DMPS) on the burden of inorganic mercury in mouse spinal motor neurons. Mice
were injected intraperitoneally with 1.0 mg HgCl2/kg body weight and one week
later with either 4,400 mg/kg DMPS, 3,600 mg/kg DMSA or 5% NaHCO3 (control) over 
4 weeks. Mercury deposits in motor neurons of 50 micron frozen sections of lumbar
spinal cord were visualised with an autometallographic technique. Optical
sections of silver-enhanced deposits were acquired using a confocal microscope in
reflective mode and the volume of the deposits within the perikaryon was
estimated. Mercury deposits occupied significantly more volume in motor neurons
after both DMPS (7.4%, SD +/- 0.7%) and DMSA (8.0% +/- SD 0.7%) treatment than in
controls (4.3%, SD +/- 1.7%). The higher levels of neuronal inorganic mercury may
be due to increased entry of mercury into motor axons across the neuromuscular
junction as a result of chelator-induced elevated circulating mercury.

In vivo indices of oxidative stress in lead-exposed C57BL/6 mice are reduced by
treatment with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid or N-acetylcysteine.

Ercal N(1), Treeratphan P, Hammond TC, Matthews RH, Grannemann NH, Spitz DR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Missouri-Rolla 65401, USA.

Knowledge of lead's capacity to disrupt the prooxidant/antioxidant balance within
mammalian tissues suggests that definitive therapy for chronic lead poisoning
should encompass both chelating and antioxidant actions. The dithiol
meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (DMSA) is the first orally administered metal
chelating agent to receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for
the treatment of childhood plumbism and possesses the potential to function as an
antioxidant by removing lead from the site of deleterious oxidation reactions.
Five weeks of lead exposure was found to deplete glutathione (GSH) levels,
increase oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and promote malondialdehyde (MDA)
production in both liver and brain samples taken from C57BL/6 mice. GSH levels
increased and GSSG and MDA levels decreased in groups of lead-exposed mice that
received 1 mmol/kg DMSA or 5.5 mmol/kg N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for 7 d prior to
sacrifice. Treatment with DMSA caused a reduction in blood, liver, and brain lead
levels consistent with its function as a chelating agent, while treatment with
NAC did not reduce these lead levels. However, NAC did cause a reduction in
indices of oxidative stress in both brain and liver samples, which implies that
this synthetic thiol-containing antioxidant is capable of abrogating lead-induced
oxidative stress in vivo. Overall, these results suggest that lead-induced
oxidative stress in vivo can be mitigated by pharmacologic interventions, which
encompass both chelating as well as thiol-mediated antioxidant functions.

Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for renal stones in children.

Dimopoulos C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Sismanoglion Hospital, Athens, Greece.

The aim of our study is to determine the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal
shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) as a method of treatment of nephrolithiasis in
childhood. Between 1986 and 1994, 50 children with renal calculi were treated by 
ESWL in our department. The age of the children ranged from 8 months to 14 years.
Thirty-three of them were boys and 17 girls. The stone location was in the renal 
pelvis in 38 cases, in the upper renal calyx in 4 cases, in the lower calyx in 2,
while 6 children had staghorn calculi. The stone size ranged between 3 and 39 mm.
All treatments were performed with Dornier HM4 except 12 children, all older than
10 years, who underwent ESWL with Dornier HM3. All ESWL procedures took place
under general anesthesia or sedation with ketamine. The number of shock waves
varied between 400 and 2,000 per treatment and the standard maximum generator
voltage was 18 kV. The overall stone clearance rate at 1 month was 66%. Fourteen 
children with large residual fragments underwent a second ESWL procedure 3 months
later. With a mean follow-up of 33 months, 41 children (82%) are stone-free. Ten 
children developed urinary tract infection and 5 Steinstrasse. Twelve children
had a pre- and post-ESWL DMSA scan and no permanent impairment of renal function 
was observed. We conclude that ESWL is the treatment of choice for urinary tract 
lithiasis in childhood. It is a low-risk method, without serious complications,
which yields as high a success rate in children as in adults. We believe that as 
the stone fragmentation and clearance is much higher in children that in adults, 
the method must be the initial approach and may be the monotherapy even in
staghorn or complex stones.

Comparative radionuclide imaging of metastatic insular carcinoma of the thyroid: 
value of technetium-99m-(V)DMSA.

Yen TC(1), King KL, Yang AH, Liu RS, Yeh SH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

We report a case of metastatic insular carcinoma of the thyroid evaluated with
201TI, 99mTc-MIBI, 99mTc-(V)DMSA, 99mTc-MDP and 131I whole-body scans, which were
obtained after total thyroidectomy. For the majority of lesions detected in the
skeleton and soft tissue, 131I images were generally available, although most
were visualized easier with 99mTc-(V)DMSA. Technetium-99m-MDP images were
considered better than 99mTc-(V)DMSA images in showing bone lesions but not
soft-tissue lesions. Both 201TI and 99mTc-MIBI scans provided sufficient
advantage to exhibit neck and mediastinal metastases, but they did not surpass
99mTc-(V)DMSA in detecting abdominal or bony lesions. In this patient with
various metastases from insular carcinoma of the thyroid, 99mTc-(V)DMSA seemed to
be the tracer of choice for whole-body imaging.

Effects of chelating agents on testicular toxicity in mice caused by acute
exposure to nickel.

Author information:

University, Japan.

N-Benzyl-D-glucaminedithiocarbamate (BGD), diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC),
dihydroxyethyldithiocarbamate (DHED), trans-1,2-cyclohexanediamine
N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (CDTA), and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
were studied for their protective effects against the testicular toxicity in mice
induced by acute exposure to nickel (Ni). Mice were injected intraperitoneally
with NiCl2 (5 mgNi/kg) and 30 min or 24 h later, they were injected
intraperitoneally with chelating agents (400 mumol/kg). Ni injection increased
lipid peroxidation and concentrations of Ca and Fe in the testes, liver, and
kidney, and decreased the testicular weight and the fertility rate. At 30 min
after Ni treatment, the chelating agents other than CDTA effectively depressed Ni
concentration in the testes. At 24 h after Ni treatment, DMSA, BGD, and DDTC were
effective in mobilizing Ni from the testes. DMSA, BGD, and CDTA significantly
prevented the increase in the lipid peroxidation, the increase in the
concentrations of Ca and Fe in the testes, liver, and kidney, and the decrease in
the fertility rate caused by Ni injection. Treatment with DMSA or BGD was more
effective than that with the others in decreasing the testicular Ni
concentration, resulting in effective protection against Ni-induced testicular
damage.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a recently developed
radiolabelled somatostatin analog (111In-pentetreotide) for the detection and
localization of both medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and carcinoid tumors, and 
to compare the results obtained with the results of 99mTc(V)-DMSA, and
radioiodinated MIBG imaging. 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy was performed in 9 
patients with MTC and in 9 patients with carcinoid tumor. Whole body and SPECT
studies were performed at 4 and 24 hours post-injection. SMS scintigraphy gave a 
positive result in 5 out of 7 patients with proven MTC lesions, and in 7 out of 9
patients with known lesions of carcinoid tumor. It gave a negative result in 2
MTC patients with high levels of calcitonin but with no evidence of disease at
conventional diagnostic modalities. The scintigraphic results were comparable
with those obtained with 99mTc(V)-DMSA in MTC and were superior to those of
radioiodinated MIBG in both MTC and carcinoid tumors. When compared with the
modifications of calcitonin levels brought about by the acute administration of
octreotide ("Octeotride test"), these correlated well in 8 out of 9 patients
studied.

111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy in the post-thyroidectomy follow-up of patients 
with medullary thyroid carcinoma.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Federico IL, Naples, Italy.

Local and lymphnodal recurrences of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in
thyroidectomy patients with elevated plasma levels of calcitonin and/or CEA can
be detected using 111In-pentetreotide (Octreoscan: OCT) scintigraphy, although
the sensitivity of this technique in localizing an intrathyroid recurrence of
tumor is affected by the low target/non-target uptake ratio. The survival rate of
patients with MTC, who have undergone thyroidectomy and who show evidence of a
rise in plasma levels of calcitonin and/or CEA is closely linked to the number
and localization of the metastases. However the role of conventional imaging
techniques (X-rays, US, CT, and MR) in the follow-up after thyroidectomy is
controversial. Numerous radiocompounds are currently being used to detect local
and distant recurrences of MTC. The present study evaluated OCT and pentavalent
99mTc-dimercapto-succinic-acid (99mTc-DMSA-V) scintigraphy performed in 13
patients with a histologic diagnosis of MTC and in one with MEN 2A, all of whom
had undergone thyroidectomy between 3 months and 15 years before. The patients
also underwent 123I (NaCI) scintigraphy to evaluate the sites and extension of
thyroidal remnants. 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy was positive in 9/14
patients (64%); the 99mTc-DMSA-V was positive in 5/14 patients (35%).
111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy recognized 18 sites of abnormal uptake (12 in
the neck); 9mmTc-DMSA-V detected 9 MTC recurrences in the same patients. In
conclusion, 111In-OCT scintigraphy represents, in the authors' experience, a
useful method, more sensitive than 9mmTc-DMSA-V, to detect MTC recurrences in
patient follow-up post-thyroidectomy.

A primary carcinoid tumor of the thymus showing ectopic ACTH syndrome was
evaluated scintigraphically with four radiopharmaceuticals and a fluorescence
method. Iodine-123-MIBG and 201Tl-Cl scintigraphy clearly demonstrated the tumor.
Gallium-67-citrate and 99mTc(V)-DMSA showed no tumor uptake. The fluorescence
method confirmed numerous storage granules of norepinephrine. Iodine-123-MIBG
scintigraphy could be useful in the presurgical diagnosis of carcinoid tumors of

An evaluation of 99Tcm-DMSA SPET with three-dimensional reconstruction in 68
patients with varied renal pathology.

Cook GJ(1), Lewis MK, Clarke SE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Guy's Hospital, London, UK.

Sixty-eight patients (135 kidneys) with varied renal pathology were evaluated
with 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) single photon emission tomography
(SPET) to determine whether it is possible to detect more renal abnormalities and
to reduce the number of false-positives due to anatomical variants when compared 
with planar imaging. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 78 years and their
pathologies included urinary tract infection (n = 50), space occupying lesions (n
= 5), calculi (n = 4), hypertension (n = 4) and others (n = 5). Planar scans were
performed 3 h after the injection of 80 MBq of 99Tcm-DMSA and a 64 x 20 s
acquisition over 360 degrees was used for SPET. High-resolution collimation was
used for both. Slices were displayed as transaxial, coronal and sagittal and/or
oblique sagittal in the plane of the kidney. Three-dimensional (3D) images were
formed by volume rendering. Each kidney was divided into three regions and each
region scored separately for the presence of an abnormality. Planar scans were
reviewed alone and then in conjunction with SPET and 3D images. Planar imaging
detected 95 abnormal regions compared with 103 using SPET. SPET reduced the
number of equivocal regions in 8 (12%) patients. The diagnosis was altered by
SPET in 17 (4%) regions in 14 (21%) patients. SPET and 3D 99Tcm-DMSA allow more
abnormalities to be detected but also allow more specific definition of apparent 
abnormalities on planar imaging.

This report describes the localization and categorization of tumors using Ga-67
and Tc-99m (V) DMSA imaging in a rare case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma associated
with an amyloid tumor. Ga-67 uptake was found in both the lymphoma and the
amyloid tumor. Significant Tc-99m (V) DMSA uptake was found only in the amyloid
tumor. In this case, Ga-67 uptake was nonspecific, but Tc-99m (V) DMSA uptake
gave additional information before treatment.

Two patients with active tuberculosis confirmed by chest radiography and positive
sputum smears were included in this study to determine whether a Tc-99m labeled
agent, such as DMSA or citrate could localize such lesions in comparison to Ga-67
citrate. Both patients had Tc-99m (V) DMSA, Tc-99m citrate, and Ga-67 citrate
scanning at 1-day to 5-day intervals. Both patients had positive scan findings
with all three radiopharmaceuticals. However, the quality of Tc-99m (V) DMSA
scans was superior to Tc-99m citrate, which showed faint uptake. Tc-99m (V) DMSA 
may be a better alternative to Ga-67 citrate in the assessment of the activity
and extent of tuberculosis.

The most commonly used radionuclides for cancer patients in Japan have been still
67Ga and 201T1 chloride. In addition to the diagnosis of lung cancer and thyroid 
tumor, 201T1 is recently applied to patients with brain tumor, bone and soft
tissue tumor and parathynoid adenoma. Comparing to Nuclear Cardiology and Brain
Nuclear Medicine, where many new radiopharmaceuticals have been developed, there 
are few new drugs in Nuclear Oncology. In other words, new radiopharmaceuticals
are expected to be developed for the diagnosis and/or therapy of cancer. In
addition to 131I for thyroid cancer, new radiopharmaceuticals such as
111In-octreotide and 99mTc(V)-DMSA have been clinically employed. In spite of
strong expectation, radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies have not been clinically
used in Japan. However, the technique of humanized antibodies has been
established and in U.S.A., 131I-labeled antibodies are reported to be effective
for the treatment of malignant lymphoma. 89Sr is useful for the relief of bone
pain caused by the bone metastasis. New findings that SPECT of 18F-FDG, a
positron emitter, has been revealed to have a great potential in the management
of cancer patients, will give a great impact on Nuclear Oncology.

Contaminated puncture wounds were simulated in rat by intramuscular injection of 
210Po. The aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of chelation
treatment as a function of time, dosage, and route of chelate administration. Ten
newly synthesized substances containing vicinal sulphydryl and carbodithioate
groups were used and their effect was compared with that of chelators clinically 
applicable in man--BAL (2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-ol), DMPS
(2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulphonate), DMSA (meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid),
and DDTC (sodium diethylamine-N-carbodithioate). The results indicate first that 
complete removal of 210Po from the injection site is achieved by only two local
injections of DMPS, beginning as late as 2 h after injection of 210Po. Second,
many of the substances used merely induce translocation of 210Po from the
injection site into other tissues. Third, a combined local treatment at the
injection site with DMPS plus repeated systemic, subcutaneous, treatments with
HOEtTTC (N,N'-di-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine-N,N-biscarbodithioate), a
derivative of DDTC, results after 2 weeks in a reduction of the estimated total
body retention of 210Po to about one-third of that in untreated controls. In the 
latter case the cumulative excretion of 210Po increased from 8 to 54%, mainly via
the faeces.

Short-term efficacy of oral dimercaptosuccinic acid in children with low to
moderate lead intoxication.

Besunder JB(1), Anderson RL, Super DM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, OH 44109,
USA.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the short-term efficacy of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) in mild to moderately lead poisoned children.
METHODS: Medical records of all pediatric patients receiving 19 days of DMSA
between June 1991 and May 1993 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were
included if their pretreatment blood lead concentration (BPb) was 1.21 to 2.36
mumol/L (25 to 49 micrograms/dL) and excluded if they: received DMSA through
participation in a pharmaceutical company-sponsored drug study; underwent
chelation therapy in the previous 28 days; or received another chelating agent
concomitantly with DMSA; or if noncompliance was documented. Homes were inspected
and abated of major hazards before chelation therapy. BPb and blood zinc
protoporphyrin concentration (ZnP) were obtained at baseline. DMSA was
administered in a dose approximating 10 mg/kg per dose every 8 hours for 5 days, 
followed by 10 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours for 14 days. Baseline laboratory
studies were repeated weekly while the patients were receiving therapy and for 2 
weeks after therapy, then monthly unless chelated again.
RESULTS: Of the 46 children who were treated with DMSA, 18 were excluded from the
analysis. In the remaining 28 children, the mean +/- SD pretreatment BPb and ZnP 
were 1.79 +/- 0.33 mumol/L (37 +/- 6.9 micrograms/dL) and 1.26 +/- 0.64 mumol/L
(71 +/- 36.1 micrograms/dL), respectively. The percent reduction (mean +/- SD) in
BPb compared with baseline was -43% +/- 20.8%, -26% +/- 16.9%, and -31% +/- 20.2%
on mean days 18, 30, and 80, respectively, whereas the changes in ZnP were -12%
+/- 21.7%, -20% +/- 18.1%, and -31% +/- 21.9%, respectively. Eighty percent of
patients had 20% or more reduction in their pretreatment BPb and/or ZnP after
completion of DMSA therapy (95% confidence interval, 61, 92%). No significant
adverse effects were observed except for neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count
of 0.752 x 10(9)/L) in one patient.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support the short-term efficacy of DMSA in children with
BPb of 2.36 mumol/L (49 micrograms/dL) or less.

Prolonged oral treatment with two monoesters of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
for depleting inorganic mercury retention in suckling rats.

Kostial K(1), Blanusa M, Piasek M, Jones MM, Singh PK.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of the Physiology of Mineral Metabolism, Institute for Medical
Research and Occupational Health, Zagreb, Republic of Croatia.

Two monoesters of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), monoisoamyl
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (Mi-ADMS) and mono-n-hexyl
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (Mn-HDMS) were compared to DMSA in their efficiency 
to mobilize 203Hg in mercury-laden suckling rats. Seven-day-old pups were given
203Hg (18.5 kBq) with a dose of 0.5 mg Hg/kg/day as HgCl2 for five days. Seven
days after the beginning of Hg loading a ten-day oral treatment with DMSA,
Mi-ADMS, or Mn-HDMS was administered at a dose of 0.25 mmol/kg/day. At the end of
experiment, radioactivity was measured in the whole body, liver, both kidneys,
and brain. Monoesters of DMSA were superior to DMSA in decreasing body and organ 
Hg retention. The highest reduction in comparison to controls in groups treated
with DMSA, Mi-ADMS, or Mn-HDMS occurred in the kidneys (48%, 97%, and 96%),
followed by reduction in the liver (24%, 84%, and 83%), and in the brain (8%,
23%, and 23%, respectively). For both, Mi-ADMS and Mn-HDMS, the reductions in the
whole body and organs were significantly greater than in controls or DMSA-treated
rats. No difference between the efficiency of the two DMSA-monoesters was found.

Effects of monoisoamyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate on arsenite-induced maternal 
and developmental toxicity in mice.

Domingo JL(1), Gómez M, Sánchez DJ, Llobet JM, Jones MM, Singh PK.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Toxicology and Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Rovira i
Virgili University, Reus, Spain.

The therapeutic efficacy of monoisoamyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (Mi-ADMS),
on arsenite-induced maternal and developmental toxicity was evaluated in the
pregnant mouse. Sodium arsenite (12 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into
Swiss mice on day 9 of gestation, whereas Mi-ADMS was given subcutaneously at
0.25, 5, 24, and 48 hr after arsenite exposure. Amelioration by Mi-ADMS of
arsenite-induced maternal and embryofetal toxicity was assessed at 23.8, 47.5,
and 95 mg/kg/day. Controls received 0.9% saline with or without arsenite.
Cesarean sections were performed on gestation day 18. In the positive control
group (treated with arsenite only), 20.8% of the pregnant animals died, whereas
37.5% of the dams were carrying completely resorbed litters. No arsenite-induced 
maternal lethality was seen following treatment with Mi-ADMS at 23.8, 47.5 and 95
mg/kg/day. Also, administration of the drug at these doses significantly reduced 
the embryolethality, as well as the incidence of some skeletal variations
provoked by sodium arsenite. Although based on these findings, Mi-ADMS might be
suggested as a potential antidote to prevent the arsenite-induced maternal and
developmental toxicity, due to their reduced toxicity compared to Mi-ADMS, DMSA
and DMPS would probably be more advisable for pregnant women exposed to arsenite.

Relationship of asymptomatic bacteriuria and renal scarring in children with
neuropathic bladders who are practicing clean intermittent catheterization.

Ottolini MC(1), Shaer CM, Rushton HG, Majd M, Gonzales EC, Patel KM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of General Pediatrics, Children's National Medical Center,
Washington, D.C. 20010, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria is associated 
with renal scarring in children with neuropathic bladders managed with clean
intermittent catheterization (CIC).
DESIGN: Retrospective study of 207 patients aged 1 to 30 years (mean 11.9 +/- 5.5
years) treated with CIC for a mean duration of 6.6 +/- 3.9 years by the spina
bifida program at Children's National Medical Center. All patients were examined 
for renal scarring with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans. Catheterized 
urine cultures were obtained annually, but bacteriuria ( > 10,000 colony-forming 
units of a single organism per milliliter) was treated only if the patients had
symptoms or if vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was present.
RESULTS: Of 207 children, 176 (85%) had one or more episodes of untreated
asymptomatic bacteriuria and 72 (35%) had one or more febrile episodes associated
with positive urine culture results. Biannual DMSA scans detected 54 new scarring
episodes in 42 patients. Of newly recognized scars, 55% were preceded within 1
year by a febrile infection, 26% were detected in patients with VUR and
asymptomatic bacteriuria, and 19% were detected in new patients during their
initial examination. Univariate analysis revealed that new scarring was present
in 35 of 176 patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria compared with 7 of 31
patients without (p = 809). Logistic regression analysis revealed that factors
associated with scarring were febrile infections (adjusted odds ratio [OR] =
30.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.8 to 95.8), age more than 20 years (OR =
4.3, CI = 1.01 to 18.5), the presence of bladder trabeculation (OR = 2.7, CI =
1.0 to 7.6), and VUR (OR = 58.8, CI = 6.3 to 547.3), but asymptomatic bacteriuria
was not associated with scarring.
CONCLUSION: In the absence of VUR, asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients
undergoing CIC is not a significant risk factor for scarring and does not require
antibiotic therapy.

Tubular reabsorption of technetium-99m-DMSA.

Müller-Suur R(1), Gutsche HU.

Author information: 
(1)Karolinska Institutet, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

Intrarenal handling of 99mTc-DMSA is still controversial, particularly in the
existence of tubular reabsorption from the tubular fluid. Experiments were
performed with micropuncture technique on the rat kidney in an attempt to
elucidate this question.METHODS: The concentration profile of 99mTc-DMSA along
the nephron was measured in fluid from Bowman's space of surface glomeruli and
from the proximal and distal tubules collected by micropuncture. Superficial
loops of proximal tubules were micropunctured and microperfused with 99mTc-DMSA
or [99mTc] pertechnetate for 10 or 20 min at physiological flow rates; the
recovery of activity was measured in the final urine.
RESULTS: Bowman's space urine contained only 14% of the 99mTc activity of
arterial plasma, indicating low filtration of 99mTc-DMSA, likely due to high
plasma protein binding. Tubular fluid-to-plasma activity ratios of 0.31 in the
proximal tubules and 1.31 in the distal tubules suggest that 99mTc-DMSA is
neither secreted nor reabsorbed along the nephron. Ninety-eight percent of the
99mTc-DMSA activity was recovered in the final ipsilateral urine, while only 0.5%
was found in the urine of the contralateral kidney.
CONCLUSION: A low fraction of 99mTc-DMSA enters the tubule by glomerular
filtration and is not reabsorbed from the tubular fluid. Thus, only peritubular
extraction by the tubular cell is responsible for renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA.

We reported two Tc-99m(V) DMSA scintigrams in patients with idiopathic synovial
chondromatosis which affected the metacarpo-phalangeal joint and shoulder joint. 
Tc-99m(V) DMSA accumulated markedly and diffusely in the tumor. Tc-99m(V) DMSA
scintigraphy would be valuable for deciding the optimal site for biopsy.

Contradictory supranormal nuclear renographic differential renal function: fact
or artifact?

Fung LC(1), McLorie GA, Khoury AE, Ash JM, Gilday DL, Churchill BM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

We previously reported contradictory supranormal nuclear renographic differential
renal function in cases of unilateral hydroureteronephrosis, in which the kidneys
with hydroureteronephrosis paradoxically had a greater differential function than
the contralateral normal mate, based on diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)
nuclear renography. To evaluate whether DTPA supranormal differential function
represented true hyperfunction, patients with DTPA supranormal differential
function were evaluated with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) nuclear renography
and the results were compared. A total of 16 patients with unilateral
hydronephrosis was identified to have DTPA differential function of 53% or more. 
They were younger than age 1 year and had never undergone any urological surgery.
In all 16 patients the DMSA differential function (mean 51.1%, range 42 to 57%)
was lower than their own corresponding DTPA differential function (mean 58.3%,
range 53 to 66%, p < 0.0001). In addition, the DMSA differential function was not
significantly different from the intuitively anticipated mean of 50% (p = 0.48). 
The DTPA supranormal differential function identified in our patients was not
corroborated by the DMSA differential function. With recent evidence that DMSA
differential function may be a better predictor of outcome following relief of
unilateral ureteral obstruction consideration should be given to using DMSA as a 
potentially more relevant method for differential function measurement in the
setting of unilateral hydronephrosis. Conversely, until the potential
deficiencies of DTPA are fully understood caution should be exercised in the
interpretation of DTPA differential function in the setting of hydronephrosis.

Reversal of oxophenylarsine-induced inhibition of glucose uptake in MDCK cells.

Liebl B(1), Mückter H, Doklea E, Fichtl B, Forth W.

Author information:

München, Federal Republic of Germany.

It has been shown that oxophenylarsine (PhAsO) inhibits glucose uptake in MDCK
cells. In addition to the known impairment of cellular energy metabolism, this
inhibition may contribute to the acute toxicity of trivalent organic arsenicals. 
We have investigated the effect of BAL, DMPS, DMSA, and other sulfur compounds on
cellular incorporation of [U-14C]PhAsO and their efficacy to revert PhAsO-induced
inhibition of glucose uptake. In the presence of [U-14C]PhAsO (2 microM), the
radiolabel was steadily accumulated by the cells over 150 min without any signs
of severe cell damage (e.g., altered morphology, increased LDH release). A
notable decrease of cellular ATP was only observed at 150 min, whereas within 30 
min uptake of D-[6-(14)C]glucose was reduced to 40% of controls. When BAL, DMPS, 
or DMSA was added after 30 min, the inhibition of glucose uptake was reversed,
accompanied by a decrease in cell-associated radiolabel from [U-14C]-PhAsO.
Water-soluble DMPS and DMSA required longer times than BAL for comparable
effects. 2,3-Bis(acetylthio)propanesulfonamide, a thioester derivative, and
dithiothreitol, a 1,4-dithiol, were effective only with the highest concentration
tested (200 microM). 2-Mercaptoethanol neither reversed inhibition of glucose
uptake nor influenced [U-14C]PhAsO incorporation. Our results show that
inhibition of glucose uptake is a very early event in PhAsO cytotoxicity which
occurs before any decrease of cellular energy metabolism and/or full cellular
loading with arsenic comes into effect. The more rapid onset of action of
lipophilic BAL compared to PhAsO action.

There are many spectrums in renal diseases which induce tubulointerstitial
nephropathy (TIN). Primarily, the renal tubule and interstitium are involved but 
glomerular and vascular lesions are found in the chronic course of TIN. Renal
scintigraphy is poor for evaluating characteristic aspects of tubular function of
TIN but demonstrate individual renal function as a whole. Particularly,
measurement of the 99m-Tc-DMSA renal uptake rate is useful for evaluating a
functioning tubular mass.

99Tcm-tetrofosmin imaging was performed in 23 thyroid cancer patients and
compared with whole-body 131I scans, neck ultrasonography and plasma
thyroglobulin levels. Of 22 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, 8 showed
identical images on 131I scan and tetrofosmin; 1 patient with medullary cancer
had identical images with 99Tcm-DMSA and 99Tcm-tetrofosmin, the findings being
confirmed by sonography. The potential usefulness of 99Tcm-tetrofosmin imaging in
the follow-up of thyroid cancers is discussed.

University of South Florida, Tampa 33612, USA.

The complete amino acid sequence of the soluble, monomeric molybdenum-containing 
enzyme dimethyl sulfoxide reductase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides f sp.
denitrificans has been determined using a combination of gas-phase Edman
sequencing of isolated peptides and direct sequencing of PCR products generated
from R. sphaeroides genomic DNA. The protein comprises 777 residues corresponding
to an apoenzyme molecular weight of 84,748 Da. The amino acid sequence was rich
in Ala and Gly residues which represented 21% of the protein's composition. The
DNA sequence was 67% rich in G and C nucleotides. The amino acid sequence
contained 10 cysteine residues which were relatively evenly distributed
throughout the sequence and featured regions of sequence corresponding to the
prokaryotic molybdopterin-binding signatures 2 and 3. While exhibiting limited
sequence similarity to the corresponding membrane-bound molybdenum-containing
subunit (DmsA) of Escherichia coli dimethyl sulfoxide reductase, the Rhodobacter 
sequence showed extensive sequence similarity to that of the E. coli
molybdoprotein, trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (torA). Comparison with other
related prokaryotic molybdenum-containing enzymes indicated the presence of two
highly conserved cysteine residues (Cys-268 and Cys-616) which may function in
molybdenum coordination.

From 1981 to 1993, we have treated 31 pediatric patients with ectopic ureterocele
(associated to duplex system, intra and extravesicals). Diagnostic work-up
included abdominal ultrasound, intravenous urography (IVU), sequence mictional
cystouretrography (SM-CU) and diuresis renography (DTPA-DMSA o MAG-3). Patients
were divided in two groups: 1. Good renal function in the affected system (5
cases) with 2 endoscopic incision of the ureterocele and 3 without surgical
treatment (all intravesical). 2. Almost non-existent ipsilateral renal function
(26 cases), treated by heminephrectomy and ureterocelic aspiration, and in the
remaining a nephrectomy was done for ipsilateral non-existent renal function. 2
cases treated by endoscopic incision presented vesicoureteral reflux, and 4 cases
treated by nephrectomy had a low grade reflux. There is no a definite treatment
established. The choice should by made based on renal function. Endoscopic
incision is a good choice in obstructed cases with good renal function. In those 
with no function at all, heminephrectomy with aspiration of the ureterocele will 
be the best treatment if we consider that almost 50 percent of the patients will 
need a second surgical procedure.

Technetium-99m pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid imaging in patients with
pituitary adenomas.

Salvatore M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, National Cancer Institute, Napoli, Italy.

We studied the tumor-seeking agent technetium-99m-labeled pentavalent
dimercaptosuccinic acid ([99mTc](V)DMSA) to visualize 21 growth hormone (GH)-,
nine prolactin (PRL)-, two mixed GH/PRL-, six adrenocorticotrophin
(ACTH)-secreting and 15 clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas, three
craniopharyngiomas and one dysgerminoma of the sella. All non-adenomas and 31 out
of 53 adenomas were studied before treatment: 22 after surgery and/or
radiotherapy. Eight cases of acromegaly were studied before and after chronic
treatment with octreotide, whereas three cases of acromegaly, one of prolactinoma
and two of non-functioning adenoma were imaged before and after adenomectomy. As 
a control group, 27 patients without any clinical evidence of pituitary adenoma
were studied: 10 of them were operated on previously and treated with iodine-131 
for metastatic thyroid carcinoma, 10 had brain tumors and the remaining seven
patients had functional pituitary hypersecretion (four Klinefelter's syndrome,
two primary hypothyroidism and one Addison's disease). The scintigraphy was
repeated after testosterone in Klinefelter's syndrome, L-thyroxine in primary
hypothyroidism and cortisone administration in Addison's disease. Seventeen
GH-secreting (81%), seven PRL-secreting (78%), three ACTH-secreting (50%), 15
non-functioning (100%) and one (50%) mixed adenoma significantly concentrated
[99mTc](V)DMSA, showing elevated tumor-to-background (T/B) ratios. The T/B ratios
were similar in untreated and surgically treated adenomas (11.2 +/- 5.6 vs 11.8
+/- 6.2). Radiotherapy significantly lowered the [99mTc](V)DMSA uptake to 5.1 +/-
2.8 (p < 0.1 vs untreated patients). Non-adenomatous lesions of the sella turcica
did not concentrate [99mTc](V)DMSA in the pituitary as well as brain tumors and 8
out of 10 metastatic thyroid cancers. The treatment with octreotide normalized GH
and insulin-like growth factor I levels and reduced [99mTc](V)DMSA from 15.7 +/- 
4.8 to 13.5 +/- 3.9 (p < 0.05). Conversely, adequate substitutive therapy
completely inhibited the uptake of the radiotracer in Klinefelter's syndrome, in 
primary hypothyroidism and in Addison's disease. The [99mTc](V)DMSA scintigraphy 
showed an overall sensitivity of 81% (43/53) in detecting pituitary adenomas,
which was increased to 95% for lesions greater than 10 mm in size. High-quality
images with minimal total body radiation were obtained, enabling a good in vivo
characterization of viable adenomatous tissue as well as an accurate monitoring
of the effects of different therapeutic regimens.

Pediatric arsenic ingestion.

Cullen NM(1), Wolf LR, St Clair D.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Emergency Medicine, Wright State University School of Medicine, 
Dayton, OH 45429, USA.

Acute arsenic toxicity is rare, and there have been no pediatric cases of acute
arsenic poisoning in the recent literature. We report a pediatric case of acute
arsenic ingestion treated initially with British antilewisite (BAL) and
D-penicillamine (DP), and later with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). A
22-month-old girl ingested 1 oz 2.27% sodium arsenate and developed immediate
vomiting and diarrhea. The patient presented to a community emergency department 
with the following vital signs: blood pressure 96/72 mm Hg, pulse 160 beats/min, 
respirations 22 breaths/min. She was pale and lethargic. Gastric lavage was
performed, and abdominal X-ray was normal. She continued to have gastrointestinal
symptoms and received 3 mg/kg BAL. Sinus tachycardia persisted, with heart rate
increasing to 200 beats/min. In 12 hours, she was asymptomatic and was started on
oral DP. On day 1, 24-hour urine arsenic was 4,880 micrograms/L. She remained
asymptomatic and was discharged on day 6 on oral DP. She did well except for a
rash that could have been a side effect of DP. On day 8, when the day 5 24-hour
urine arsenic level was returned at 650 micrograms/L, the patient was readmitted 
and started on DMSA. After 4 days on DMSA, the 24-hour urine arsenic level was 96
micrograms/L. White blood cell count and renal and hepatic function remained
normal. The excretion half-life was approximately 2.5 days, which is at least 2
to 3 times faster than the spontaneous excretion half-life expected in adults.
Long-term follow-up was unavailable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Oral dimercaptosuccinic acid and ongoing exposure to lead: effects on heme
synthesis and lead distribution in a rat model.

Erratum in
    Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 1996 May;138(1):192.

Lead (Pb) exposure and subsequent toxicity continues to be a significant problem 
in the United States. Treatment with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has 
been reported to be effective in reducing the body's Pb burden, with fewer
adverse side effects than other chelating agents. The oral availability and
relative safety of DMSA presents the controversial option of treating patients
with Pb poisoning on an outpatient basis. Despite recommendations that children
be removed from the Pb contaminated environment, some children will inevitably be
exposed to environmental Pb while receiving oral DMSA therapy. The study
hypothesized that oral DMSA chelation therapy is beneficial even when faced with 
continued dietary Pb. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to Pb in water for 35 days
and then placed in various treatment groups, including groups administered oral
DMSA with and without concurrent Pb exposure. The concentration of Pb in blood
and critical organs and Pb diuresis were measured. The effect of Pb on heme
synthesis was determined by assaying the urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid
(delta-ALA), and blood zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP). DMSA reversed the hematological
effects of Pb, decreased the blood, brain, bone, kidney, and liver Pb
concentration, and produced a marked Pb diuresis, even when challenged with
ongoing Pb exposure. In conclusion, even though DMSA treatment without exposure
to Pb is optimal, oral DMSA could be beneficial even when challenged with ongoing
Pb exposure.

(Mi-BDMS), and mono-n-butyl-meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (Mn-BDMS) in increasing 
survival and arsenic elimination in experimental arsenic poisoning was
investigated. Male mice (strain NMRI) received arsenite sc (survival study: 130
mumol/kg, 7 mice/group; elimination study: 85 mumol/kg (LD5) together with a
tracer dose of 73As(III), 6 mice/group). After 30 min mice were treated with 0.7 
mmol/kg of DMSA or a monoester ip or via gastric tube (ig). Control animals
received saline ip. In the survival study mice were observed for 30 days. In the 
elimination study, the 73-arsenic content of several organs (blood, liver, heart,
lung, kidneys, spleen, testes, brain, small intestine, large intestine, muscle,
and skin) was measured 0.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hr after the arsenic injection using a
gamma counter. Survival increased correspondingly well with the increase of
arsenic elimination. DMSA, Mi-ADMS, Mn-ADMS, Mi-BDMS, and Mn-BDMS markedly
decreased arsenic content in most organs as soon as 1.5 hr after treatment. Only 
in small and large intestine were higher arsenic amounts found, indicating a
shift in arsenic elimination from the renal to the fecal route, and thereby
suggesting a protective effect for the kidneys. Given ip, the monoesters turned
out to be similarly as effective as the parent drug DMSA. Following ig treatment,
the DMSA monoesters Mi-ADMS and Mn-ADMS seemed to be superior to DMSA with regard
to survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Metabolism of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in lead-poisoned children and
normal adults.

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, or succimer) is an oral chelating agent
for heavy-metal poisoning. While studying the urinary elimination of unaltered
DMSA, altered DMSA (i.e., its mixed disulfides), and lead in children with lead
poisoning, we observed a pattern of urinary drug elimination after meals
suggestive of enterohepatic circulation. The excretion of lead in urine patterned
the elimination of altered DMSA rather than the parent molecule. In addition, the
half-life of elimination of DMSA via the kidney was positively associated with
blood lead concentration. Two additional crossover studies of DMSA kinetics were 
conducted in normal adults to confirm the presence of enterohepatic circulation
of DMSA after meals. In one, increases in plasma total DMSA concentration were
observed after meals in all six subjects; these increases were prevented by
cholestyramine administration 4, 8, and 12 hr after DMSA. In the second, the
administration of neomycin also prevented increases in DMSA after meals. These
studies indicate that 1) a metabolite(s) of DMSA undergoes enterohepatic
circulation and that microflora are required for DMSA reentry; 2) in children,
moderate lead exposure impairs renal tubular drug elimination; and 3) a
metabolite of DMSA appears to be an active chelator.

99mTc pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid [99mTc (V) DMSA], a useful agent for
imaging thyroid medullary carcinoma and other tumors, can be reliably prepared by
addition of NaHCO3 and then Na99mTcO4 to a commercial kit for 99mTc trivalent
DMSA [99mTc (III) DMSA], followed by bubbling oxygen through the solution for 10 
min. 99mTc (V) DMSA made by this method is radiochemically pure and stable for 24
h, and it gives a rat biodistribution similar to that of the agent made by
previous methods. Clinical biodistribution and radiation dosimetry studies are
planned.

Absolute 99Tcm-DMSA renal uptake in children: optimum time to scan.

Flower MA(1), Meller ST, Chittenden SJ, Fielding SL, Evans K, Gordon I.

Author information: 
(1)Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, UK.

Absolute renal uptake was measured at 2, 4 and 6 h in 27 patients in order to
determine a more convenient time for uptake compared with the 6-h measurement
proposed by other authors. Measurements made at 2 and 4 h would need to be
increased by 20 and 6%, respectively, to convert to the value at 6 h.
Measurements at 4 h are a reasonable compromise to achieve a
high-count/low-background image in a reasonable time and to obtain a good
estimate of the predicted 6 h uptake at a single scanning session. The percent
renal uptake at 6 h, U(6), can be derived from the percent uptake measured at t
hours after injection, U(t), using the following formula: U(6) = U(t) x CF(t),
where CF(t) = 1.0 + 0.03 (6 - t) for 4 < or = t < or = 6.

Author information: 
(1)Queen Mary's Hospital for Children, Carshalton, Surrey, UK.

Absolute 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake was measured in 160 children
ranging in age from 3 months to 15 years. In total, 108 pairs of kidneys were
normal and the mean uptake for the left and right kidneys was 24.0 and 23.4%,
respectively. The mean summed uptake for the left and right kidneys was 47.3%. A 
method of calculation based on the geometric mean of the anterior and posterior
views was used to allow for radiation attenuation. DMSA uptake did not vary
significantly with the age of the child. The value of the method in the
assessment of abnormal kidneys is presented. The effect of using a supine or
prone position for the anterior view was also investigated.

Civile di Giaveno (Torino).

Ureterocele is a congenital urinary abnormality characterized by the presence of 
an intra-bladder hernia or cystic ballooning of the lower end of a ureter between
the mucosa and muscle of the bladder. The abnormality leads to urinary retention 
and recurrent urinary tract infection which can cause irreversible damage to the 
kidney. Antenatal ultrasound diagnosis of ureterocele is possible but remains
difficult. The disease is confirmed during radiologic examination after birth,
and renal function is assessed by 99mTc-DMSA. Ureterocele, while not an uncommon 
pediatric urologic problem, has been reported only rarely in adults. It is
bilateral in 10% of cases, is rare in black people, and requires thoughtful
management decisions. A relatively uncommon case of bilateral ureterocele with
single ureter, associated with left vesicoureteral reflux, in African black man
is reported. The patient was investigated by ultrasonography and intravenous
urography. Surgical transvesical right "osteoplasty" and excision of the left
ureterocele plus ureteric reimplantation, using Politano-Leadbetter technique,
were performed. The surgical approach to ureterocele is discussed and we
underlined the difficulty of therapeutic decisions, especially if surgery is
considered.

Chelation of organoarsenate with dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Shum S(1), Whitehead J, Vaughn L, Shum S, Hale T.

Author information: 
(1)Texas Poison Center Network at Amarillo 79106, USA.

Alkane arsenate herbicides are available commercially, and their acute toxicity
has been well documented in previous studies. Animal studies have indicated that 
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) can be used as an oral chelating agent. A 20-y-old
white male cocaine addict attempted suicide by drinking approximately 500 ml of a
16% monosodium methanearsenate solution. He vomited 10 or more times and was
admitted to the intensive care unit with impending shock and early liver and
renal involvement. Four 5-day courses of 30 mg DMSA/kg/24 h were given. This
brought the serum arsenic level from 2,871 micrograms/L to 6 micrograms/L, and
his urine arsenic level from 78,920 micrograms/L to 21 micrograms/L in 30 d.
Renal function tests returned to normal, with normal renal creatinine clearance, 
normal blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. However liver functions were
abnormal, with elevation of serum transaminases, which later proved secondary to 
chronic hepatitis. No side effects of DMSA was encountered during the therapy.
DMSA was successfully used to detoxify acute organoarsenate poisoning in a
clinical setting, supporting experimental reports in the literature.

Oxygen bubbling can improve the labelling of pentavalent technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Kobayashi H(1), Suzuki KH, Sakahara H, Yao ZS, Yokoyama A, Konishi J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Kyoto University, Faculty of Medicine, Japan.

It has previously been reported that almost all of the trivalent technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc (III) DMSA) present in the labelling product of
pentavalent technetium-99m DMSA (99mTc (V) DMSA) can be changed into 99mTc (V)
DMSA by bubbling with pure oxygen. We therefore performed studies in animals
(mice) and humans to investigate the effect of such oxygen bubbling on the
labelling efficiency of and on the renal uptake of 99mTc. The method of labelling
of 99mTc (V) DMSA was that of Hirano. It was found that oxygen bubbling oxidized 
the contaminated 99mTc (III) DMSA into 99mTc (V) DMSA in vitro and decreased the 
uptake of radioactivity in the kidney in both animals and humans.

Stereoisomeric selectivity of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acids in chelation therapy
for lead poisoning.

Fang X(1), Fernando Q.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721, USA.

The formation constants of lead chelates of the stereoisomers of
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were determined from potentiometric titrations
in the presence of the competing ligand, EDTA. The lead chelates formed at pH 7.4
with the stereoisomers of DMSA are the monomeric complexes PbL and HPbL.
Formation of PbL and HPbL at pH 7.4 is independent of total concentrations of
lead and DMSA present, and so is the concentration ratio of PbL:HPbL. Lead is
completely chelated at pH 7.4 when the total concentration of ligand is equal to 
or greater than the total concentration of lead present. Lead tends to bind to a 
greater extent with rac- than with meso-DMSA, and the relative extent increases
with an increase in the concentration ratio of ligand to lead and finally reaches
a constant value of 45. The binding sites in the chelates, PbL, of the
stereoisomers of DMSA are the two thiolate groups and one carboxylate group.
rac-DMSA also forms a dimeric complex Pb2L2 in which both carboxylate groups of
the ligands participate in binding with lead ions. The formation constants of the
lead chelates of rac-DMSA were invariably found to be larger than those of the
corresponding of meso-DMSA chelates, because in all the lead chelates of the
stereoisomers of DMSA formed in solution, rac-DMSA existed in staggered anti
conformations, whereas meso-DMSA preferred a staggered gauche conformation with
respect to carboxylate groups in the ligands. The potential of using ZnL2 of
rac-DMSA as a therapeutical lead chelator was assessed by considering its
lead-mobilizing ability and its ability to deplete endogenous zinc; on this basis
it is predicted that ZnL2 of rac-DMSA is a better chelator than meso-DMSA for the
treatment of lead poisoning.

Mercury uptake by primary cultures of rat renal cortical epithelial cells. I.
Effects of cell density, temperature, and metabolic inhibitors.

Endo T(1), Sakata M, Shaikh ZA.

Author information:

Japan.

Factors affecting the renal uptake of inorganic mercury were investigated using
primary cultures of rat renal cortical epithelial (RCE) cells under protein- and 
amino acid-free conditions. The cells were isolated from kidneys of adult rats
and cultured. Confluence of culture (cell density), monitored morphologically and
by total protein content, was achieved on Day 5. The RCE cells were incubated
with 1 microM Hg at 37 degrees C for 30 min, followed by washing with
phosphate-buffered saline containing various chelating agents (i.e., EGTA, PEN,
DMSA, and BAL) to remove the surface-bound, noninternalized Hg. A substantial
portion of Hg was bound to the cell surface. The removal of Hg from these binding
sites was dependent on the stability constants of the chelating agents for Hg and
lipophilic BAL removed the most Hg. Hg accumulation by the cells was dependent on
cell density and decreased as the cell culture became confluent, possibly due to 
the formation of tight junctions resulting in a majority of the Hg transport
occurring through the apical membrane. As measured after BAL washing, metabolic
inhibitors, NaF, DNP, and ouabain decreased Hg accumulation by 28% and low
temperature (4 degrees C) decreased it by 62%. Dependence of Hg uptake on
metabolic energy and temperature suggests that a part of Hg is transported via
active transport system. The pronounced decrease of Hg uptake at 4 degrees C
indicates that, in addition to active transport, Hg transport also involves
simple diffusion, some of which is dependent on membrane fluidity. It is
concluded that Hg transport in RCE cells through the apical membrane occurs
mainly by diffusion, and to a smaller extent by active transport.

Combined therapeutic potential of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and calcium
disodium edetate on the mobilization and distribution of lead in experimental
lead intoxication in rats.

Flora SJ(1), Bhattacharya R, Vijayaraghavan R.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Defence Research and Development
Establishment, Gwalior, India.

Asymptomatic lead poisoning remains a serious public health problem in developed 
and developing countries. Chelation therapy particularly with calcium disodium
ethelenediamine tetracetic acid (CaNa2EDTA) is often used therapeutically to
reduce the body burden of lead. This chelating drug has serious side effects and 
drawbacks primarily related to redistribution of lead, nephrotoxicity, and
essential metal depletion. The present study was planned to determine the
effectiveness of CaNa2EDTA and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) used in
combination. Both drugs, when administered individually, resulted in significant 
urinary excretion of lead and lowered the tissue lead burden. Combined treatment 
with CaNa2EDTA and DMSA elicits an additive response in promoting urinary lead
elimination, depleting body lead burden, and restoring altered lead-sensitive
biochemical variables. Further, no redistribution of lead to brain or any other
soft organ following combined DMSA-CaNa2EDTA treatment was observed indicating a 
definite advantage of combined therapy over the conventional treatment with
CaNa2EDTA or DMSA alone. However, an elevation of serum transaminase activity,
creatinine level, and depletion of blood zinc level may limit the usefulness of
this combined treatment.

A case of recurrent medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) was evaluated with 123I-MIBG, 
99mTc(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), and 201Tl scintigraphy. This patient had
been operated on for MTC in the right thyroid. Recently a left neck mass was
noticed, and was suspected of being a recurrence of MTC based on increased plasma
calcitonin (CT) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). He was operated on for the
neck mass which revealed MTC, and papillary thyroid cancer was incidentally found
in the left thyroid, but the CT and CEA levels remained high, and remaining MTC
tumor was suspected. But the location of the tumor was unknown. Although
99mTc(V)-DMSA scintigraphy is generally believed to be superior in sensitivity to
123I-MIBG scintigraphy, it did not demonstrate the tumor site but 201Tl and
123I-MIBG did. Furthermore, 123I-MIBG scintigraphy has greater specificity for
tumors which arise in the neural crest. Judging from the results of this case and
cases reported in the literatures, both 123I-MIBG and 99mTc(V)-DMSA should be
performed in the detection of recurrent MTC.

Tc-99m DMSA SPECT imaging in patients with acute symptoms or history of UTI.
Comparison with ultrasonography.

Mastin ST(1), Drane WE, Iravani A.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Nuclear Medicine, Shands Hospital, Gainesville, Florida, USA.

Although planar cortical scintigraphy has been demonstrated to be a sensitive
test for the detection of renal infection and scarring, one criticism has been
radiation dose to the renal cortex. Recent studies of cortical SPECT suggest a
sensitivity for detection of lesions equal to, or greater than, that of planar
scans. The authors prospectively performed SPECT scans on 36 patients referred
for recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) (11 of 36), or recent onset of
symptoms of UTI (25/36) after 30-40% of the standard 130 MBq (3.5 mCi) adult dose
of Tc-99m DMSA was administered. Comparison was made with ultrasonography (US)
performed at, or near, the same time. Of 67 kidneys evaluated, 34 (51%)
demonstrated focal cortical loss on Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy, 1 kidney was small 
in size, and 32 kidneys were normal. Abnormalities were noticed in only 13 (19%) 
of kidneys on US. Previously, US has been the primary imaging modality in the
evaluation of the young patient with UTI. Triple-headed Tc-99m DMSA SPECT
scintigraphy is a more sensitive, low-dose (12 mGy, 1.2 r) method of detecting
renal cortical abnormalities. As such, it is a more appropriate test for
identifying sites of cortical infection and scarring and for following patients
on prophylactic therapy for evidence of asymptomatic break-through infections.

    Arch Dis Child. 1996 Jan;74(1):89.

Long term follow up of children with urinary tract infections, in whom imaging
investigations were performed at presentation, has been used to identify features
that distinguish those at greatest risk of progressive renal damage. No single
investigation at presentation was able to predict subsequent deterioration but,
by employing a combination of imaging investigations, it was possible to separate
groups with high or low probability of progressive damage. In the low risk group 
the incidence of progressive damage was 0.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0 to
1.3%). The combination of both scarring and reflux at presentation, or one only
of these but accompanied by subsequent documented urinary tract infection, was
associated with a 17-fold (95% CI 2.5 to 118) increase in the relative risk of
progressive renal damage compared with children without these features. The
recommended combination of investigations at presentation for girls of any age
and boys over 1 year is ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy in all, to detect both scarring and significant structural
abnormalities, renography in children with dilatation of any part of the urinary 
tract on ultrasound, to distinguish dilatation from obstruction, and an isotope
voiding study in all who have acquired bladder control. This gives the best
separation between those at high and those at low risk of progressive damage with
least radiation dose and lowest rate of instrumentation. Micturating
cystourethrography (MCU) should be restricted to girls who have not acquired
bladder control, unless there is reason to suspect a significant structural
abnormality such as urethral valves. A single non-febrile urinary tract infection
that responds promptly to treatment is not a justification for performing MCU in 
boys under 1 year or in children of any age with bladder control. No case can be 
made for any abbreviated schedule of investigation. These risk factors should be 
taken into account when designing follow up protocols.

Scarring following renal trauma in children.

Surana R(1), Khan A, Fitzgerald RJ.

Author information: 
(1)Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin,
Dublin, Ireland.

OBJECTIVE: To assess factors relating to renal scarring following kidney injury.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 25 children who had documented renal injury
between 1981 and 1988 were included in the study and 19 were followed up for 1
month to 12 years (mean 5.5 years) and the development of hypertension and renal 
scars assessed using ultrasonography and radionuclide scans (dimercapto-succinic 
acid, DMSA).
RESULTS: Of the 19 children 13 had renal contusions, four had renal lacerations
and two sustained severe renal injury, one of whom had pelvi-ureteric disruption.
Eighteen patients presented with macroscopic or microscopic haematuria except the
patient with pelvi-ureteric junction disruption who presented 3 weeks later with 
abdominal distension, vomiting and hypertension. All the patients were managed
without an operation except the latter patient who required nephrectomy. Renal
scarring was demonstrated in four children at a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, one 
following renal contusion (5% scarring), two after renal laceration (50%
scarring) and one after rupture of the kidney (100% scarring). In one patient
intravenous pyelography did not reveal a renal scar but a radionuclide scan
performed 5 years later demonstrated a scar. Transient hypertension was noted in 
only two patients but peripheral plasma renin levels were normal.
CONCLUSION: Renal scars developed in four of 19 patients with renal trauma and
more than half of the patients with severe renal injury. Long-term follow-up
including a radionuclide scan is therefore necessary in patients with renal
injury. Although no sustained hypertension was noted in any patients in this
study, long-term blood pressure assessments would seem prudent.

Therapeutic efficacy of combined meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and calcium
disodium edetate treatment during acute lead intoxication in rats.

(1)Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, Lucknow, India.

1. The therapeutic ability of Ca disodium EDTA and meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) was studied, both individually and when given in combination, in
reducing lead concentration in blood and other soft tissues, and in restoring
lead induced altered biochemical variables in acute lead intoxicated rats. 2.
Combined treatment with the above two chelating agents was more beneficial in
reducing blood and hepatic lead compared to treatment with these drugs alone.
Kidney lead concentration however, remained high following combined treatment,
indicating the possibility of extra renal burden following treatment. 3. Lead
sensitive biochemical variables also responded more favourably to combined
treatment than treatment with these drugs alone. However, clinical biochemical
indices indicate caution regarding the use of this new treatment regimen, and
further investigation is required.

DMSA chelation during co-exposure to lead: increased locomotor activity in
lead-exposed mice but not controls.

Stewart PW(1), Burright RG, Donovick PJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Psychology, State University of New York at Binghamton 13902,
USA.

We investigated the effect of chelating agent meso-2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) on indices of "hyperactive" behavior in lead-exposed and control
Binghamton Heterogeneous Stock (Het) mice. As expected, 6 weeks of ingestion of
0.5% lead acetate in drinking water reduced immobility in a forced water swim
relative to controls. DMSA did not attenuate this behavioral change. In fact,
DMSA interacted with lead exposure to increase locomotor activity in the forced
water swim. DMSA also apparently excacerbated lead's tendency to reduce
immobility. While any generalizations to human populations should be cautioned,
these results and others suggest the need for further research.

The use of radioactive isotopes in thyroid evaluation and therapy gives important
information in the endocrine assessment of the aged. Thyroid uptake imaging can
be used to establish a hypothyroid or hyperthyroid state and can determine the
functional status of a palpable nodule. Investigational agents, such as T1 201m
DMSA, MIBG, FDG, and Gallium are reviewed in relation to the evaluation of
neoplasia. A detailed discussion of thyroid carcinoma ablation and subsequent
radioiodine therapy is described, as are radiation safety procedures as they

Monoisoamyl (Mi-ADMS) and mono-n-hexyl (Mn-HDMS) monoesters of
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were given orally or parenterally for the
mobilization of inorganic mercury in suckling and older rats. Chelators were
administered at a dose of 2 x 0.5 mmol kg-1 on two consecutive days 2 weeks after
a single 203Hg injection. Six days later, whole-body, kidney, liver and brain
radioactivities were determined in gamma scintillation counters. Both Mi-ADMS and
Mn-HDMS were found to be superior to DMSA in mobilizing mercury from body and
organs. The results were similar after oral or parenteral treatment. The
efficiency of both monoesters was even higher in younger than in older rats. This
is the first report on the mobilization of mercury from the body of sucklings
under conditions of late oral treatment.

caucasians 288) presented between 3 wk and 72 yr of age (mean 17.3 yr; SD 14.4
yr). One hundred and seventy-six had unilateral reflux nephropathy and 118 had
bilateral reflux nephropathy diagnosed on intravenous urography and/or a DMSA
scintigraphy.
RESULTS: The majority of patients, particularly women, presented with a urinary
tract infection. Twenty-five patients (8.5%) had hypertension at presentation, 15
(5.1%) loin or abdominal pain, 14 (4.8%) proteinuria and six (2%) renal
insufficiency. At the last follow up (mean age 34.2yr; SD 13.7yr; range 15-81yr),
113 patients (38%) had hypertension or were on antihypertensive therapy. This was
significantly more frequent in those with severe bilateral renal parenchymal
scarring. Proteinuria was present in 92 (31%); 40 of these had renal
insufficiency. Seventy-one (24%) had a creatinine clearance < 70 mL/min and 43
(15%) a urinary tract infection. Eighteen patients had suffered from a urinary
calculus. Proteinuria and renal insufficiency were significantly more frequent in
those with severe bilateral reflux nephropathy.
CONCLUSION: All patients with reflux nephropathy who have proteinuria,
hypertension or renal insufficiency should be under regular follow up.

Cloning and characterization of a gene cluster, phsBCDEF, necessary for the
production of hydrogen sulfide from thiosulfate by Salmonella typhimurium.

Alami N(1), Hallenbeck PC.

Author information: 
(1)Département de microbiologie et immunologie, Université de Montréal, Québec,
Canada.

We cloned, by complementation of an H2S- mutant, a cluster of Salmonella
typhimurium genes, phsBCDEF, that appears to be essential for the anaerobic
production of hydrogen sulfide from thiosulfate. Tn5 mutagenesis and ExoIII
deletion analysis showed that approx. the entire region of a 3.3-kb subclone was 
necessary for H2S production. Subsequent sequencing revealed the presence of five
potential translationally coupled open reading frames (ORFs). Their putative
protein products were confirmed by synthesis from a phage T7 expression system.
Comparison of the encoded sequences with previously determined sequences suggests
that these genes constitute part of a thiosulfate-reducing operon coding for a
membrane-associated electron transport chain which contains proteins potentially 
capable of ligating iron-sulfur clusters and heme. Immediately upstream from
these genes, a region encoding the C-terminal portion of an ORF (OrfA) was
identified that showed a high degree of similarity to some other anaerobic
terminal reductases, polysulfide reductase (PsrA) of Wolinella succinogenes and
dimethylsulfoxide reductase (DmsA), formate dehydrogenase
(formate-hydrogene-lyase linked) (FdhF) and nitrate reductase (NarG) of
Escherichia coli.

Update on dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scanning in children with urinary tract
infection.

Goldraich NP(1), Goldraich IH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatrics, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.

The dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan is a method for assessing kidney
function. Indications for DMSA scanning in children with urinary tract infection 
(UTI), as well as timing, have changed. Pitfalls in interpreting DMSA scans
include: (1) acute pyelonephritis (APN), (2) tubular dysfunction, (3)
hypertension, (4) use of captopril in patients with renovascular hypertension and
(5) duplex kidneys. Interpretation of DMSA scans in children with UTI vary
according to timing and clinical setting. During the course of a febrile UTI a
DMSA scan may reveal a normal kidney, APN or a non-functioning, small and/or
ectopic kidney. In the absence of UTI (up to 6 months) in children with
vesicoureteric reflux a DMSA scan may indicate a normal kidney, renal scarring
(reflux nephropathy), occult duplex kidney and allows the progression of scarring
and hypertrophy of normal areas of the kidney to be followed anatomically. The
DMSA renal scan in now the most reliable test for the diagnosis of APN. The
transient abnormalities due to APN can occur in normal or scarred kidneys.
Lesions due to reflux nephropathy (defined as a defect in the renal outline or
contraction of the whole kidney) are permanent. Intravenous urography reveals
renal abnormalities later than the DMSA scan. If abnormalities are seen on a DMSA
scan performed during the course of APN it is impossible to predict the outcome: 
they can progress to permanent scarring or heal completely. An abnormal DMSA scan
during a febrile UTI allows the identification of children at risk of developing 
renal scars. These children should be carefully investigated, maintained on
long-term quimioprophylaxis and followed.

The intravenous urogram in the detection and evaluation of renal damage following
urinary tract infection.

Smellie JM(1).

Author information: 
(1)University College London Hospitals, UK.

Intravenous urography (IVU) still provides the most comprehensive structural
assessment of the urinary tract. In particular, the radiological renal
appearances approximate closely to the morphology of the renal scarring of reflux
nephropathy or chronic atrophic pyelonephritis. It also provides reproducible
renal measurements for follow-up assessment of renal growth and scarring. It is
now less often used for first-line investigation of the acute urinary tract
infection (UTI) because the swelling accompanying acute renal involvement is less
easily recognised than the areas of defective function demonstrated on
99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) studies. Also IVU contributes a
higher radiation dose when calculated for full IVU (dependent on the number of
films exposed) and there is a slight risk of side effects from injected contrast 
media, reduced by using non-ionic compounds. Because of its value in confirming
such a serious diagnosis as renal scarring, suspected on ultrasonography or DMSA 
scintigraphy, modification of the technique of IVU with adequate preparation and 
the use of a reduced number of films, or single films localised to the renal
areas, should be considered. Expertise in the interpretation of IVU must also be 
maintained because of the ancillary information regarding bowel and bladder
function, the spine and evidence of stones, pertinent to the management of
children with UTI and renal scarring. IVU and DMSA study remain complementary
investigations.

Diagnostic value of Tc-99m (V) DMSA for chondrogenic tumors with positive Tc-99m 
HMDP uptake on bone scintigraphy.

Technetium-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy was performed in 17 patients with 37
chondrogenic tumors (13 osteochondromas, 14 enchondromas, and 10 chondrosarcomas)
that had previously shown uptake of Tc-99m HMDP. Technetium-99m (V) DMSA showed
high uptake by all chrondrosarcomas, but low or no uptake always indicated benign
chondrogenic tumors. Technetium-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy may be superior to
Tc-99m HMDP scintigraphy for distinguishing benign and malignant chondrogenic
tumors, and could also be useful for diagnosing the malignant transformation of
chondrogenic tumors.

[Quantitative analysis of individual renal function using 99mTc-DMSA
scintigram--comparison with 131I-OIH renogram].

[Article in Japanese]

99mTc-2,3-di-mercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) is able to be used for the
quantitative analysis of individual renal function by calculating the uptake
ratio. The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical feasibility of DMSA
uptake ratio as compared with 131I-ortho-iodo-hippuran (OIH) renogram pattern.
Two hundred eleven cases (191 patients, 1 to 87 years old) with renal disorders
and 4 normal volunteers (27.8 +/- 2.4 years old) were studied. Just prior to the 
DMSA study in the same day, OIH renogram was carried out. They were divided into 
6 types by OIH renogram patterns. In 24 cases of normal renogram pattern and
normal blood data who were defined as the normal group and 4 normal volunteers,
DMSA uptake ratio showed negative correlation with increasing age (r = 0.61, p < 
0.05). Patients of the severe impaired functioning and the non functioning
patterns showed significantly decreased DMSA uptake ratios as compared with the
normal pattern. There was also a significant difference in DMSA uptake between
impaired functioning patterns. Compensative hemi-hypertrophy kidneys showed
significantly higher DMSA uptake ratios than those of atrophic kidneys. The
possibility of the quantitative analysis of the functional compensation was
presumed. In conclusion, quantitative analysis of individual renal function using
DMSA uptake ratio is considered to be useful to evaluate the renal functional
reserve.

Therapeutic potential of meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid or
2,3-dimercaptopropane 1-sulfonate in chronic arsenic intoxication in rats.

Establishment, Gwalior, India.

The therapeutic efficacy of two thiol chelators, meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) or 2,3-dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) in treating chronic arsenic
intoxication was investigated in male rats. Both the chelators were effective in 
promoting urinary arsenic excretion and restoring arsenic induced inhibition of
blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity and hepatic glutathione
level. Elevation of urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid excretion and arsenic
concentration in blood, liver and kidneys were reduced significantly by both the 
chelators. Histopathological lesions induced by arsenic were also effectively
reduced by the above chelators. DMSA being more effective than DMPS. The results 
suggest DMSA and DMPS to be effective antidotes for treating chronic arsenic
toxicity in experimental animals.

Four chelating agents that have been used most commonly for the treatment of
humans intoxicated with lead, mercury, arsenic or other heavy metals and
metalloids are reviewed as to their advantages, disadvantages, metabolism and
specificity. Of these, CaNa2EDTA and dimercaprol (British anti-lewisite, BAL) are
becoming outmoded and can be expected to be replaced by
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, succimer) for treatment of lead
intoxication and by the sodium salt of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid
(DMPS, Dimaval) for treating lead, mercury or arsenic intoxication. Meso-2,3-DMSA
and DMPS are biotransformed differently in humans. More than 90% of the DMSA
excreted in the urine is found in the form of a mixed disulfide in which each of 
the sulfur atoms of DMSA is in disulfide linkage with an L-cysteine molecule.
After DMPS administration, however, acyclic and cyclic disulfides of DMPS are
found in the urine. The Dimaval-mercury challenge test holds great promise as a
diagnostic test for mercury exposure, especially for low level mercurialism.
Urinary mercury after Dimaval challenge may be a better biomarker of low level
mercurialism than unchallenged urinary mercury excretion.

In vitro inhibition of glutathione reductase by arsenotriglutathione.

Stýblo M(1), Thomas DJ.

Author information: 
(1)Curriculum in Toxicology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599,
USA.

Arsenotriglutathione, a product of the reaction of arsenate or arsenite with
glutathione, is a mixed-type inhibitor (Ki = 0.34 mM) of the in vitro reduction
of glutathione disulfide by purified yeast glutathione reductase. Notably,
arsenotriglutathione was a 10-fold more potent inhibitor than either arsenite or 
glutathione. The inhibition of glutathione reductase by arsenotriglutathione was 
partly reversed by the addition of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).
However, high concentrations of DMSA also inhibited the reduction of glutathione 
disulfide by the yeast enzyme (IC50 of 7 mM with 0.1 mM glutathione disulfide).
Ultrafiltration of the enzyme-arsenotriglutathione complex recovered about 74% of
the original (non-inhibited) activity, suggesting that the inhibition of
glutathione reductase by arsenotriglutathione had both reversible and
irreversible components. The relatively high potency of arsenotriglutathione as
an inhibitor of glutathione reductase may alter the reduction of glutathione
disulfide and affect the availability of glutathione that is required for the
reduction of arsenate to arsenite and for the formation of the
arsenotriglutathione complex.

Prevention by chelating agents of metal-induced developmental toxicity.

Domingo JL(1).

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Toxicology and Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Rovira i
Virgili University, Reus, Spain.

Chelating agents such as calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA),
2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BAL), or D-penicillamine (D-PA) have been widely used for
the past 4 decades as antidotes for the treatment of acute and chronic metal
poisoning. In recent years, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), sodium
2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate (DMPS) and sodium
4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonate (Tiron) have also shown to be effective to
prevent against toxicity induced by a number of heavy metals. The purpose of the 
present article was to review the protective activity of various chelating agents
against the embryotoxic and teratogenic effects of well-known developmental
toxicants (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, uranium, and vanadium). DMSA and DMPS
were found to be effective in alleviating arsenate- and arsenite-induced
teratogenesis, whereas BAL afforded only some protection against arsenic-induced 
embryo/fetal toxicity. Also, DMSA, DMPS, and Tiopronin were effective in
ameliorating methyl mercury-induced developmental toxicity. Although the
embryotoxic and teratogenic effects of vanadate were significantly reduced by
Tiron, no significant amelioration of uranium-induced embryotoxicity was observed
after treatment with this chelator.

A prospective study of cortical scarring in acute febrile pyelonephritis in
adults: clinical and bacteriological characteristics.

PS.

Author information:

Previous reports have demonstrated lesions on computerized axial tomography (CT),
and nuclear scintigraphy (DMSA) in acute pyelonephritis (PN). We undertook a
prospective study of all patients presenting to our hospital with PN over 40
months. Patients who fulfilled diagnostic criteria, were treated with intravenous
antibiotics. Excluding two who were pregnant, all patients had imaging by
intravenous urography (IVU), CT and DMSA during their admission. Urine samples
were collected prior to treatment. Patients without IVU evidence of cortical
scarring but with parenchymal defects on CT and/or DMSA underwent a repeat DMSA
three or more months after the acute episode. Of the 164 patients, 142 were
female. E. coli was found in 116 patients. Forty-six patients had an abnormality 
on IVU. Of the 106 patients without IVU evidence of cortical scarring, 59 had a
defect on CT and/or DMSA. Late DMSA scans in 35 of these 59 patients showed a
persistent abnormality in 77%. E. coli characteristics such as P-fimbriae and
Type 1 fimbriae were not predictive of acute imaging abnormalities. Inhibition of
E. coli growth by the addition of EDTA was highly predictive of acute CT and DMSA
abnormalities with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 82.8%. Acute
pyelonephritis is often associated with acute CT and/or DMSA abnormalities which 
may evolve into renal cortical scars. Acute scan abnormalities can be predicted
by the presence of E. coli which were susceptible to EDTA in culture. Late
scarring could not be predicted by clinical features, response to treatment or
antibiotic used.

Poor renal uptake of Tc-99m DMSA and Tc-99m MDP in a patient with Fanconi
syndrome and near normal glomerular filtration rate.

Kim SE(1), Cho JT, Lee DS, Chung JK, Kim S, Lee MC, Lee JS, Koh CS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Korea.

The authors present a patient with Fanconi syndrome who demonstrated poor renal
uptake of Tc-99m DMSA and high urinary concentration of the tracer. Tc-99m DTPA
imaging was normal and the creatinine clearance was only minimally decreased.
These findings suggest that Tc-99m DMSA may be accumulated in the kidney by
glomerular filtration and subsequent tubular reabsorption. A Tc-99m MDP bone scan
showed faint renal uptake, as well as diffuse high skeletal uptake, particularly 
in the spine, demonstrating that the metabolic bone disease associated with
Fanconi syndrome can be one of the causes of poor renal visualization on a bone
scan.

Author information:

A total of 282 renal scintigrams with Tc-99m DMSA in 238 children ranging in age 
from 10 days to 13 years performed during a 3-year period were reviewed. The
authors present 94 kidneys in 85 children in whom no sign of pathology was
demonstrated clinically, either by ultrasound or intravenous urography, or by
micturating urethrocystography. By exploring homogeneity or heterogeneity of
tracer distribution, kidney length, and background level, the authors were able
to identify a "normal" pattern of tracer distribution according to age. They
found that the average kidney length was 56 mm at birth, growing 1 mm per month
during the first year of life, and 4 mm per year thereafter, until puberty.
Average background activity was 14% of the average kidney activity at birth which
decreased to approximately 6% during the first year of life, with no further
decrease thereafter.

Urinary tract infection: a comparison of four methods of investigation.

Smellie JM(1), Rigden SP, Prescod NP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatrics, University College Hospital, London.

The optimal regimen for investigating children with urinary tract infection (UTI)
remains uncertain. Ultrasonography, contrast micturating cystourethrography
(MCU), intravenous urography (IVU), and technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) studies were performed in 58 children with UTI under 14 years of age
attending two teaching hospitals and the results compared. All four
investigations were normal in 12 children. In 36 with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR)
on MCU, dilatation was reported on ultrasonography in eight children.
Radiological renal scarring was seen in 20 children; it was suspected on
ultrasonography in nine, with dilatation alone in four, and a normal report in
seven. Duplex kidneys identified on IVU were unrecognised on ultrasonography or
DMSA studies; ultrasonography showed no change corresponding to presumed acute
defects on DMSA studies that later resolved. Disparities were observed at all
ages. This study suggests that ultrasonography is unreliable in detecting VUR,
renal scarring, or inflammatory change and, alone, is inadequate for
investigating UTI in children.

Reduction of lead retention by mono-3-methylbutan-1-yl
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate in suckling rats.

Blanusa M(1), Kostial K, Piasek M, Jones MM, Singh PK.

Author information: 
(1)Department of the Physiology of Mineral Metabolism, Institute for Medical
Research and Occupational Health, Zagreb, Croatia.

The mono-3-methylbutan-1-yl (monoisoamyl) ester of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (Mi-ADMS) was previously found to be superior to meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) in mobilizing cadmium and mercury deposits in young and adult mice
and rats. It was also tested to mobilize lead in and adult mice. It was also
tested to mobilized lead in adult mice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
the ability of Mi-ADMS to chelate lead at a very young age, in sucking rats. Lead
was applied intraperitoneally at the dose of 5 mg kg-1 in the form of lead
acetate to six-day-old rats. Treatment with DMSA and Mi-ADMS was administered
orally at the dose of 0.25 mmol kg-1, either as early (0.5 and 24 h) or a delayed
(4th and 5th day after lead application) therapy. At the end of the experiment
(6th day) lead was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry in the skeleton, 
liver, kidney and brain of the animals. Results showed that Mi-ADMS was more
efficient than DMSA after early application in reducing the skeletal, kidney and 
brain content of lead. After delayed application it was either (skeleton and
kidneys) or better (brain) than DMSA. There was no statistically significant
influence of either chelator on liver lead content. The major finding is that
Mi-ADMS at low doses causes a much higher reduction in brain retention of lead in
sucklings than DMSA. This is important because the brain is considered to be the 
target organ of lead toxicity in the youngest age group.

Comment in
    J Nucl Med. 1995 Feb;36(2):207-10.

To assess the clinical role of 99mTc(V)-DMSA in primary lung cancers, SPECT
imaging was performed on 31 patients with suspected lung cancer.METHODS: Planar
and SPECT images were obtained at 3 to 4 hr after intravenous injection of
approximately 555 MBq 99mTc(V)-DMSA. Two uptake ratios (the maximum counts/pixel 
in the lesion to the average counts in normal tissue) were calculated.
RESULTS: Various types of primary lung cancers (adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell
carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma, large-cell carcinoma and bronchial carcinoid
tumor) were imaged by 99mTc(V)-DMSA SPECT. Approximately 90% of the lung
carcinomas showed increased uptake and were clearly demonstrated by SPECT images.
Four cases incidentally revealed osseous metastatic lesion. Three benign lesions 
did not show increased uptake. Three cases were false-negative and there were no 
false-positive cases for the primary lesions.
CONCLUSION: Technetium-99m(V)-DMSA SPECT images demonstrated approximately 90% of
the primary lung cancers. Uptake ratios were higher in squamous-cell carcinomas
than adenocarcinomas. Evaluation of mediastinal tumor extension and nodal
metastatic lesion was very difficult by high blood-pool activity in the major
cardiovascular structures due to slow blood-pool clearance. However,
99mTc(V)-DMSA SPECT imaging was very useful for detecting primary lung cancers
and metastatic lesions to the osseous structures.

Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of renal parenchymal damage by 99mTc-DMSA
planar and SPECT scintigraphy.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine,
Sapporo, Japan.

The initial 99mTc-DMSA studies carried out over a four year period in 229
patients with various heterogenic causes of lower urinary tract abnormalities
were reviewed. Anatomical damage to the renal parenchyma was graded by means of
planar and SPECT studies into a six group classification proposed by Monsour et
al.: grade 0 (normal), I (equivocal), II (single defect), III (more than 2
defects), IV (contracted or small) and V (no visualization). Parenchymal uptake
of 99mTc-DMSA was quantitated from planar images at 2 hours postinjection by a
computer assisted gamma camera method. SPECT studies could enhance the pick-up
rate for parenchymal uptake defects by a factor of 1.5 in comparison with planar 
imaging. The incidence of anatomical damage to the renal parenchyma increased
with a high radiological grade for VUR, and renal uptake per injection dose of
99mTc-DMSA by the individual kidney significantly decreased in grades III and IV 
of the anatomical classification. These data revealed that 99mTc-DMSA planar is
still useful for evaluating gross structural damage and for quantitative
evaluation of the kidney with computer assistance. SPECT scintigraphy is more
effective in disclosing anatomical damage to the renal parenchyma than planar,
although it needs further discussion as to whether SPECT may increase sensitivity
with minimal or no adverse affect on specificity.

analogues.

We have synthesized seven 99mTc-labeled hippurate analogues: 99mTc-hippurate.
99mTc-alpha-hydroxyhippurate, 99mTc-m-hydroxyhippurate. 99mTc-o-hydroxyhippurate 
[99m-salicylglycine (99mTc-SG)], 99mTc-p-hydroxyhippurate,
99mTc-salicylglycylglycine and 99mTc-salicylglycylglycylglycine. All of the
99mTc-hippurates were cleared rapidly from the rat blood and accumulated in the
kidney. Of them 99mTc-SG has the desirable biological properties of two
diagnostic agents. 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mTc-MAG3) and
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinate (99mTc-DMSA). A fraction of 99mTc-SG showed a transit
time in the kidney and was excreted rapidly into the urine, being similar to
99mTc-MAG3. The binding ratio to the plasma proteins was 96.0% (91.1% in the
albumin), being higher than that of 99mTc-DMSA, at 30 min. The lipophilicity
revealed far less pH-dependent changes in a range of pH 4.0 to 7.4. 99mTc-SG
distributed about 91% in the renal cortex, being similar to that of 99mTc-DMSA.
From the present studies, the biological properties of 99mTc-SG suggest that it
is a promising agent for measuring renal plasma flow and renal morphology.

For this study, 24 patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and 10 with
carcinoid-/GEP-tumours underwent scintigraphy with 123I-Tyr3-octreotide or
111In-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide (Octreoscan) or 99mTc-V-DMSA. Calcitonin and CEA
were elevated in MTC patients, the other had tumour lesions on CT.
Octreoscan-scintigraphy was positive in 68% of all suspicious cases. On the other
hand, 123I-Tyr3-octreotide showed only rarely positive results.
99mTc-V-DMSA-scans in MTC patients were positive in 23%. Liver metastases could
be seen only with Octreoscan in the non-MTC-group. These results showed better
sensitivity of 111In-labelled octreotide.

Detection of recurrence from medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) remains a
diagnostic problem, especially when increased serum tumour marker levels suggest 
recurrence and conventional imaging techniques are non-diagnostic. In this study,
we performed 111In-octreotide and 99mTc(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans
in a series of eleven patients with MTC presenting with elevated serum tumour
markers after surgery. 111In-octreotide whole body studies detected tumour in six
of the eleven patients studied and detected nine tumoral localizations.
99mTc(V)-DMSA whole body studies detected tumour in five of the eleven patients
studied and eight tumoral localizations. 111In-octreotide and 99mTc(V)-DMSA
studies detected recurrence in all four patients with basal calcitonin levels
above 1000 ng/l. We conclude that 111In-octreotide and 99mTc(V)-DMSA studies have
limited sensitivity to detect recurrence in patients with MTC, although their
sensitivity may improve with high serum calcitonin levels. These radionuclide
imaging techniques should be employed when conventional imaging techniques are
negative or inconclusive or, in the case of 111In-octreotide studies, should be
employed when we went to investigate the presence of somatostatin receptors that 
provide the basis for treatment with somatostatin analogues.

The effects of two chelating agents, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 
2,3-dimercaptopropane 1-sulfonate (DMPS) on the mobilization, distribution,
hepatic and hematopoietic toxicity of beryllium were compared in male rats
exposed to beryllium. Animals were exposed to beryllium nitrate (0.5 mg/kg,
orally, daily 5 days/week) for 21 days. Twenty-four hours after the last dose
they were injected with a chelating agent (DMSA or DMPS) (25 or 50 mg/kg, twice
daily for 5 days). The administration of DMSA and DMPS at a dose of 50 mg/kg
marginally elevated the fecal excretion of beryllium. DMPS was effective in
depleting beryllium from the liver, spleen and kidneys. However, DMPS (50 mg/kg) 
results in the redistribution of beryllium to blood. Beryllium-induced inhibition
of hepatic alkaline phosphatase and hepatic adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)
were restored considerably with the chelating agents. Also, hepatic and renal
histopathological lesions were less marked in rats treated with DMPS (50 mg/kg)
compared with those treated with beryllium per se and DMSA. These effects were
more prominent at the 50-mg/kg dose of chelating agents than at 25 mg/kg. These
results suggest that treatment with DMPS has some beneficial effects in
experimental beryllium intoxication.

Detection of medullary carcinoma of thyroid, with liver metastasis, using 99mTc
DMSA(V) scintigraphy.

Author information: 
(1)Dept of Nuclear Medicine, K E M Hospital, Parel, Bombay.

A sixty year old female referred for thyroid and liver scintigraphy had a
clinical history of progressive swelling in the neck with hepatomegaly. A large
cold area was detected in the right thyroid lobe using 99mTc pertechnetate and in
the right lobe of liver using 99mTc phytate. Subsequent whole body scan with
99mTC DMSA(V) showed avid tracer uptake in right lobe of thyroid and liver.
Aspiration cytology of thyroid and liver showed medullary carcinoma of thyroid
with its metastasis in liver. Histopathology following thyroidectomy confirmed
the diagnosis. Thus 99mTc pentavalent DMSA contributes specificity to diagnose
medullary carcinoma of thyroid and metastatic lesions.

Is there still a need for Tc-99m DMSA renal imaging?

Bair HJ(1), Becker W, Schott G, Kühn RH, Wolf F.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Federal
Republic of Germany.

Scintigraphy with Tc-99m MAG3 is, to date, the most commonly used technique for
evaluating separate renal function (SRF). In this study, the performance of this 
technique is compared to Tc-99m DMSA. A total of 37 patients with various kidney 
disorders (12 children and 25 adults) underwent both Tc-99m DMSA and Tc-99m MAG 3
scintigraphy. In children and adults of normal weight the correlation coefficient
between the two methods was 0.99 (P < 0.001), whereas in individuals who were
more than 10% overweight according to Broca, or who had abnormal anatomical
positions of the kidneys, the correlation coefficient was 0.82 (P < 0.05).
Scintigraphy with Tc-99m DMSA was more accurate in renal parenchyma lesions.
These results indicate that Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy is preferable for the
evaluation of SRF in patients who are more than 10% overweight, or have abnormal 
positions of the kidneys.

United Kingdom.

Planar renal scintigraphy with Tc-99m DMSA has become established as a standard
diagnostic test to determine if a kidney has been scarred by infection. It has
been suggested that high resolution SPECT may improve the sensitivity of
detection of renal scars. To determine if it is possible to produce good quality 
renal SPECT with a short acquisition time, 10 adults were examined with a new
multi-detector gamma camera using 8 minute, 16 minute, and 32 minute
acquisitions. The number of defects seen (N = 16) with an 8 minute acquisition
was not significantly different from the defects (N = 15) seen using a 16 minute 
and a 32 minute acquisition. In adults when imaging with a multi-detector gamma
camera there was no clinical advantage in using an acquisition of longer than 8
minutes.

Diagnostic imaging in children with urinary tract infection: the role of
intravenous urography.

Hansen A(1), Wagner AA, Lavard LD, Nielsen JT.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Hvidovre Hospital, University of Copenhagen,
Denmark.

Ninety children referred to hospital with urinary tract infection (UTI) were
investigated by iv urography (IVU), ultrasonography (US) and 99mTc
dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA). Fifty-eight children also underwent
micturating cystourethrography (MCUG). In 36 (40%) of the children, at least one 
result was abnormal. Abnormal findings were found in 29 children with IVU, in 10 
with US and in 16 with DMSA. Six of the 58 children had vesicoureteric reflux
(VUR) in 8 kidneys. In 16 children, IVU was the only examination with an abnormal
result, and in 10 of these the findings were considered important for treatment
or prognosis. IVU is an important supplement to US and DMSA in investigation
programs for children with UTI. IVU should be performed in cases of renal scars, 
dilatations or in children with recurrent infections.

Provocative chelation with DMSA and EDTA: evidence for differential access to
lead storage sites.

Lee BK(1), Schwartz BS, Stewart W, Ahn KD.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Industrial Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Chunan, Republic
of Korea.

OBJECTIVES--To validate a provocative chelation test with 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic 
acid (DMSA) by direct comparison with the standard ethylene diamine tetraacetic
acid (EDTA) test in the same subjects; and to compare and contrast the predictors
of lead excretion after DMSA with those after EDTA. A metal chelating agent given
orally, DMSA may mobilise and enhance the excretion of lead from the storage
sites in the body that are most directly relevant to the health effects of lead. 
A provocative chelation test with DMSA could thus have wide potential application
in clinical care and epidemiological studies. METHODS--34 male lead workers in
the Republic of Korea were given a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg DMSA, urine was
collected over the next eight to 24 hours, and urine volume and urinary lead
concentration determined at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours. Either two weeks before 
or two weeks after the dose of DMSA 17 of these workers also received 1 g
intravenous EDTA followed by an eight hour urine collection with fractionation at
0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours. RESULTS--Urinary lead concentration peaked at two hours 
after DMSA and four hours after EDTA. Lead excretion after DMSA was less than
after EDTA, and cumulative excretion after DMSA plateaued at six to eight hours. 
The two hour and four hour cumulative lead excretions after DMSA were highly
correlated with the eight hour total (r = 0.76 and 0.95). In multiple linear
regression analyses, blood lead was found to be an important predictor of
EDTA-chelatable lead, whereas urinary aminolevulinic acid (ALAU) was associated
with DMSA-chelatable lead. Notably, lead excretion after DMSA was greatly
increased if EDTA was given first. An earlier dose of EDTA also modified the
relation between ALAU and DMSA-chelatable lead in that workers who received EDTA 
before DMSA showed a much steeper dose-response relation between these two
measures. CONCLUSIONS--The predictors of lead excretion after DMSA and EDTA are
different and an earlier dose of EDTA may increase lead excretion after a
subsequent dose of DMSA. The results suggest that two hour or four hour
cumulative lead excretion after DMSA may provide an estimate of lead in storage
sites that are most directly relevant to the health effects of lead.

Urinary excretion of lead and mercury after oral administration of
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in patients with motor neurone disease.

Author information:

Department of Neurology, The Netherlands.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are
progressive neurodegenerative disorders involving motor neurones. The aetiology
of the non-familiar forms is still unknown but it has been suggested that
long-term exposure to heavy metals such as lead and mercury may play a role in
the pathogenesis of these diseases. In 53 patients suffering from ALS (n = 42)
and SMA (n = 9) the oral administration of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, 20
mg/kg) did not result in a greater mobilization of lead and mercury from
peripheral depots than in control subjects. Although it cannot be excluded that
the amount of lead or mercury excreted after DMSA administration may not be a
reflection of the amount accumulated in the motor neurons, this study does not
provide support for the hypothesis that heavy metals play a significant role in
the occurrence of motor neurone diseases.

Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid(DMSA) renal scintigraphy in patients with acute
pyelonephritis.

Lee KW(1), Bin KT, Jeong MS, Shong MH, Shin YT, Ro HK.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Chungnam National
University Hospital, Taejon, Korea.

OBJECTIVES: Recently, several authors reported that Tc-99m DMSA renal scan
frequently showed cortical defects of the involved kidneys even in the patients
with acute pyelonephritis who did not show abnormal findings in the
ultrasonography and intravenous pyelography (IVP).
METHODS: In order to evaluate the utilities of Tc-99m DMSA renal scan and the
clinical meaning of cortical defects in the Tc-99m DMSA renal scan of the
patients with acute pyelonephritis, ninety two patients with acute
pyelonephritis, from March 1991 to February 1994 in Chungnam National University 
Hospital(CNUH), were included in this study. Patients were subdivided as Group
A:Patients showing normal Tc-99m DMSA renal scan (n = 42) and Group B:Patients
with definite cortical defects on the Tc-99m DMSA renal scan (n = 50). We
compared clinical characteristics such as age and sex, recurrency, duration of
fever, bacterial culture study, incidence of renal insufficiency and the results 
of renal ultrasonography and intravenous pyelography between the two groups.
RESULTS: Fifty four percents of 92 patients with acute pyelonephritis showed a
significantly longer febrile period after admission, higher positive rates on the
urine and blood culture studies and higher incidence of renal insufficiency than 
those of the Group A patients. Sixty nine percents of Group B patients showed
normal results in ultrasonography or IVP study.
CONCLUSIONS: Tc-99m DMSA renal scan was a more sensitive imaging test than
ultrasonography in kidneys and IVP to detect pyelonephritis lesions and may be
useful to predict the patient group with a severe disease course. These patients 
may need more careful management and further studies to evaluate the possibility 
of complications.

(1)Department of Paediatrics, Gazi University Hospital, Turkey.

This prospective study was designed to investigate the most relevant radiological
approach for the evaluation of urinary tract infections (UTI) in childhood. In
the first 48 hours following the diagnosis of UTI, all patients underwent 99mTc
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning, ultrasonography (US) and intravenous
urography (IVU). For the imaging of renal parenchymal infection the sensitivity
of IVU and US as compared to DMSA scanning were found to be 9.09% and 25%,
respectively. It was concluded that 99mTc DMSA, where available, should be the
first step for the accurate diagnosis and follow-up of patients with UTI.

Congenital urinary malformations associated with congenital heart disease are
very rare. We present a case of horseshoe and supernumerary kidney associated
with coarctation of aorta diagnosed by a combination of techniques of
teleradiography, aortography, intravenous pyelography; ultrasonography, magnetic 
resonance imaging, and Dimercapto Succinic Acid (DMSA) and Diethylene Triamine
Pentacetate (DTPA) imaging. This case represents the first reported instance of
horseshoe and supernumerary kidney associated with coarctation of aorta.

Renal dysplasia in infants: appearance on 99mTc DMSA scintigraphy.

Roach PJ(1), Paltiel HJ, Perez-Atayde A, Tello RJ, Davis RT, Treves ST.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

Infantile renal dysplasias, including multicystic dysplastic kidneys (MCDK), are 
reported rarely to accumulate radiopharmaceuticals on renal scintigraphy. 99mTc
DMSA is a highly sensitive tracer for detecting functioning renal cortical tissue
and may be more suited to studying renal dysplasia than 99mTc DTPA. We reviewed
the ultrasound studies and 99mTc DMSA scintigrams of 42 infants (age range 1-12
months) with known or suspected MCDK. Overall, uptake on 99mTc DMSA scintigraphy 
was evident in 6/41 (15%) dysplastic kidneys. Of the 18 patients who underwent
nephrectomy, histopathological examination revealed that uptake correlated
closely with the presence of mature renal cortical tissue in the affected kidney.
Our study shows that a small, but significant number of MCDK will show low-grade 
uptake on DMSA scintigraphy. This finding may be relevant given the reliance
placed on renal scintigraphy in planning treatment for infants with suspected
MCDK, particularly with the increasing trend for the non-operative management of 
this condition.

17 children from 18 months to 16 years old were treated by ESWL for calculi of
the upper urinary tract using a Sonolith 3000 lithotriptor. 31 calculi (5 to 60
mm) have been treated on 16 renal units and 3 pelvic ureters. The renal
parenchyma of all treated kidneys was considered normal on preoperative
ultrasound and IVU; 8 patients had a preoperative DMSA. The treatment required 1 
to 4 sessions delivering 400 to 3000 shocks per session and 400 to 6000 shocks
per treatment at 14 kV. Within three months post treatment, 14 patients (88.23%) 
were stone free and 3 patients had residual fragments (2 needed further surgical 
extraction). With a follow up of three months to five years, all patients have a 
normal blood pressure, serum creatinine and sterile urine. In no instance, IVU or
ultrasound revealed a lesion imputable to ESWL. Seven patients had a DMSA six
months or more after the last session; 4 of these were normal but the three other
patients had a loss of function and an heterogeneous fixation on the treated
side. These preliminary results confirm that ESWL is efficient for upper urinary 
tract calculi destruction in children. However ESWL seems to be susceptible to
induce parenchymal damage, detected by DMSA, whose incidence and long term
effects particularly on blood pressure need further evaluation.

Narain Hospital, New Delhi, India.

Twenty-five patients with solitary cold thyroid nodules (SCN) were studied by
fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology, radionuclide perfusion scanning (RPS) and 
pentavalent technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (99m Tc DMSA) scanning, with an
aim to distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic nodules. All the patients were 
operated upon and the nodules were subjected to histopathological examination. 13
of the 25 nodules (52%) were malignant (7 papillary carcinomas, 3 medullary
thyroid carcinomas and 1 each of follicular carcinoma, insular carcinoma and
clinically anaplastic thyroid tumour). The specificity of DMSA scanning and FNA
cytology were 100% and that of RPS 60%. The sensitivity of RPS and DMSA scanning 
were 80% and 20% and that of FNA cytology (using a broad definition of
test-positivity), 100%. Additionally, FNA cytology could morphologically type the
majority of neoplasms.

(1)Department of Radiology, Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles, CA 90027.

Post-transplant hypertension can be a diagnostic dilemma. In a select population 
of pediatric patients, in whom other diagnostic methods failed to reveal an
abnormality, renal cortical SPECT imaging, using either Tc-99m GH or Tc-99m DMSA,
revealed information that was not apparent on conventional planar renal
scintigraphy. Abnormalities detected by this methodology included unsuspected
renal infarct and areas of segmental perfusion deficit. The authors conclude that
this methodology is a valuable tool in the evaluation of post renal
transplantation hypertension in pediatric patients.

We report a case of renal polar infarction in a 13-year old boy following
surgical excision of contralateral congenital lobar emphysema. Patient history
was unremarkable and yielded no data suggestive of any other underlying pathology
or systemic disease. The diagnosis was made on the CT, arteriography and DMSA
scan findings. The etiology could not be determined. The patient was treated
conservatively with prophylactic antibiotic therapy and followed closely. There
were no complications; the patient was asymptomatic one month after the episode. 
The control IVP showed residual segmental atrophy and ultrasound evaluation
disclosed cortical atrophy. The most common cause of this condition, the
diagnostic algorithm, treatments and their indications are discussed. Renal graft
infarction, which may be associated with acute rejection or venous and/or
arterial thrombosis, warrants special attention. The treatment and clinical
course are significantly different, although the diagnosis is made using the same
methods.

We compared the efficiency of the IVP, the ultrasound and the DMSA scan in the
detection of pyelonephritic lesions during the evaluation of 165 kidneys in 83
children, aged up to 14 years, with vesicoureteric reflux. Our study showed an
efficiency of 60.20% for the IVP, 29.60% for the ultrasound and 96.90% for the
DMSA scan. These results clearly show that the best imaging method for detecting 
renal scars is the DMSA scan, followed by IVP and ultrasound.

99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy was utilized to investigate the influence of ESWL
on renal function in comparison with that of PNL. In the beginning, the
reproducibility of renal uptake rate by the scintigraphy was examined in eleven
healthy volunteers under both non-diuretic and diuretic states. The renal uptake 
rate was shown to be sufficiently reproducible in the same person in the two
different trials. However, the differences and the standard deviations were shown
to be a few percentages, which were not statistically significant. Changes in the
repeated renal uptake rate seem to indicate not only changes of renal function
with the treatment but also some technical errors. Herein, to investigate changes
in renal function of the therapeutic side, the uptake ratio rate (rate of uptake 
rate in the therapeutic side/uptake rate in the contral lateral side) was
utilized instead of uptake rate. Renal scintigraphy was carried out in 48
patients with unilateral renal stones before and after ESWL or PNL monotherapy or
the combined ESWL and PNL therapies. Within one week of treatment, the uptake
ratio rate significantly decreased in patients with PNL or the combined ESWL and 
PNL, although DMSA uptake rate in the therapeutic side did not significantly
changes. Neither renal uptake rate nor uptake ratio rate significantly changed
after ESWL treatment. There was no significant difference in changes of uptake
ratio rate between Siemens Lithostars Plus and the improved Dornier HM-3
lithotriptors. This study indicated that ESWL monotherapy did not affect the
uptake ratio rate, although PNL monotherapy and the combined ESWL and PNL
therapies may affect the uptake ratio rate to some extent.

Elemental mercury vapour toxicity: treatment and levels in plasma and urine.

(1)Laboratoire de Biochimie-Toxicologie, Hôpital Fernand Widal, Paris, France.

1. We report two cases of acute mercury vapour intoxication in humans. The
mercury vapour was released from smelting alloys (gold-mercury amalgam). The
alloy was apparently contaminated with an unknown amount of mercury. 2. Within
half an hour of the incident, the victims began having moderate headache, nausea,
lumbar pain and shortness of breath at rest. The patients were treated with BAL
(2,3 dimercaptopropanol), followed by DMSA (2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid). 3.
Serial measurements of mercury metal in plasma and in urine were made for ten
days. 4. The results suggest that in spite of the treatment, relatively high
concentrations of mercury remain in the plasma for a very long time, and this
could be explained by the progressive release of mercury from red blood cells and
tissues after oxidation. However, BAL and DMSA did not seem to be the most
efficient antidotes. They reduce the plasma inorganic mercury uptake at
concentrations of < 50 micrograms I-1.

The diagnostic value of 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy, ultrasonography and renal functional parameters [urine
N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG)/creatinine and urine albumin/creatinine
quotients] in acute pyelonephritis (APN) were studied in 39 children (28 girls,
11 boys, median age 9 months, range 2 weeks to 9.4 years, 28 patients < 1 year,
11 patients > 1 year) with first-time urinary tract infection. Ultrasonography of
the urinary tract was performed on admission and together with DMSA scintigraphy 
(< 10 days from admission). Urine NAG/creatinine and urine albumin/creatinine
quotients were measured daily and after 6-8 weeks. Ultrasonography revealed
abnormalities in 12 of 39 (31%) patients [11/32 patients (34%) with positive DMSA
scintigraphy], while DMSA uptake defects were present in 32 of 39 (82%) patients 
[21/28 < 1 year (75%), 11/11 > 1 year (100%), P = 0.08]. Urine NAG/creatinine and
urine albumin/creatinine quotients were significantly higher in children < 1 year
with APN, as well as in non-renal fever controls, than in older children.
However, in both age groups the urine NAG/creatinine and urine albumin/creatinine
quotients were significantly higher in APN than in non-renal fever. The urine NAG
and albumin excretion decreased rapidly after the initiation of antimicrobial
therapy and had normalized at 6-8 weeks. The size and grade of the DMSA uptake
defect (DMSA score) did not correlate with duration of disease at admission,
maximum C-reactive protein or maximum fever. The urine NAG/creatinine quotient in
the children < 1 year showed, however, a significant correlation with the DMSA
score (r = 0.58, P < 0.05), while no correlation was found in the older children.
We conclude that DMSA scintigraphy is a sensitive method to confirm the clinical 
diagnosis of APN, although a substantial number of infants appear to have normal 
scans. Early determination of the urine NAG/creatinine and albumin/ creatinine
quotients may further improve the diagnostics in the infant.

Imaging methods in the study of urinary tract infections in children.

Almeida HN(1), Ribeiro M, Colarinha J, Santos JF, Rosa FC.

Author information: 
(1)Nuclear Medicine Institute, Radiology Department, Santa Maria Hospital-Lisbon 
University.

When studying a child with urinary tract infection it is important to detect and 
localize any renal (scar) or urologic anomaly. Here we study the information
obtained using: renal and vesical ultrasound (US), DMSA scan and radiologic or
isotopic cystogram.METHODS: We studied 148 children with more than one urinary
infection and/or pyelonephritis; their mean age was 35.9 months (1-148 months);
55% were girls. The three diagnostic examinations--US, DMSA scan and cystogram
were made in this order; the DMSA scan or cystogram was never made sooner than
one month after the UTI.
RESULTS: In 42% of the children the three exams were normal; 4 of these children 
had another UTI and the urodynamic study revealed vesical disfunction. 11% had
renal scars (DMSA scan) with normal US and cystogram; 30% had VUR, 50% of which
had an altered US and 57% had renal scars on the DMSA scan. 12% of the children
had an altered US with a cystogram showing no VUR; 66% of these had renal scars. 
4% had vesical anomalies in the US and cystogram.
CONCLUSION: The three exams chosen were able to direct the diagnostic approach of
UTI, being sufficient in most of the cases. We would like to emphasize the
importance of the DMSA scan in diagnosing unsuspected renal scars.

Effect of cell growth rate on expression of the anaerobic respiratory pathway
operons frdABCD, dmsABC, and narGHJI of Escherichia coli.

Tseng CP(1), Hansen AK, Cotter P, Gunsalus RP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of California,
Los Angeles 90024.

The fumarate reductase (frdABCD), dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)-trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) reductase (dmsABC), and nitrate reductase
(narGHJI) operons in Escherichia coli encode enzymes involved in anaerobic
respiration to the electron acceptors fumarate, DMSO or TMAO, and nitrate,
respectively. They are regulated in response to anaerobiosis and nitrate
availability. To determine how each operon is regulated in response to changes in
cell growth rate and in oxygen availability, expression of frdA-lacZ, dmsA-lacZ, 
and narG-lacZ fusion genes was examined during continuous culture. After a change
in the cell growth rate, each anaerobic electron transport pathway operon fusion 
responded somewhat differently. Whereas frdA-lacZ expression increased by
fivefold as the growth rate decreased from 0.60 to 0.12/hour during aerobic
growth, little change was seen under anaerobic conditions. In contrast, growth
rate-dependent expression of narG-lacZ expression occurred under anaerobic
conditions but not under aerobic conditions. Finally, dmsA-lacZ expression did
not vary greatly for any of the growth rates tested. When cells were shifted from
aerobic to anaerobic growth conditions, expression of each fusion increased at a 
moderate rate and peaked or "overshot" before reaching a new equilibrium value.
This "overshoot" phenomenon was independent of the fnr gene product, which
functions as a transcriptional activator of each respiratory operon during
anaerobic conditions. In contrast to the moderate rate of anaerobic induction
seen for narG-lacZ expression, the addition of nitrate caused a rapid induction
response. The cell appears to have many ways to adjust cell respiration in
response to changes in cell growth conditions.

Effects of chelating agents on tissue distribution and excretion of nickel in
mice.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Hygienic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto
University, Japan.

N-Benzyl-D-glucaminedithiocarbamate (BGD), diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC),
di-hydroxyethyldithiocarbamate (DHED), trans-1,2-cyclohexanediamine
N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid (CDTA), and 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were
studied for their relative efficacies in the distribution and excretion of nickel
in mice exposed to nickel. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with NiCl2
(5mgNi/kg) and 30 min or 24 hr later, they were injected intraperitoneally with
chelating agents (400 mumol/kg). At 30 min after treatment with nickel, these
chelating agents all significantly enhanced the fecal excretion of nickel, and
DMSA significantly increased the urinary excretion of the metal. At 24 hr after
nickel treatment, BGD, DDTC, and DHED significantly increased the fecal excretion
of nickel and BGD was the most effective on the fecal excretion of nickel. CDTA
and DMSA significantly enhanced the urinary excretion of the metal. At 30 min
after nickel treatment, chelating agents other than CDTA effectively depressed
nickel concentration in the kidney, lung, and testes. BGD, CDTA, and DMSA
significantly reduced the nickel concentration in the liver. However, DDTC and
DHED caused the redistribution of nickel to the brain. At 24 hr after nickel
treatment, these chelating agents were effective in mobilizing nickel from the
kidney, and chelating agents other than DHED were effective in mobilizing nickel 
from the liver, lung, and testes. These results indicate that the injection of
BGD or DMSA at both 30 min and 24 hr after treatment with nickel can remove
nickel from the body without redistribution of nickel to other tissues, such as
brain, more effectively than DDTC, DHED, and CDTA. Furthermore, the pattern of
excretion of nickel after treatment with the chelating agents was related to the 
partition coefficients of the nickel-chelating agent complexes.

Author information:

of Cincinnati Medical Center, OH 45267-0577.

INTRODUCTION: The treatment of primary thyroid cancer requires protracted
follow-up because of to the possibility of the development of recurrent
metastases many years after the initial diagnosis. Often such follow-up involves 
imaging at regular intervals with diagnostic I-131 studies. However, not all
thyroid cancer concentrates I-131. The purpose of this article is to review the
efficacy of alternative diagnostic imaging modalities for follow-up of thyroid
carcinomas that do not concentrate radioiodine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: These procedures include the use of nuclear medicine
imaging with thallium-201 (TI-201), Tc-99m-sestamibi, Tc-99m pentavalent
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), radiolabeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen
antibodies, and radioiodinated-131 meta-iodobenzyl guanidine, as well as
computerized x-ray tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound
(US).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Thallium-201, MRI, and pentavalent DMSA provide adequate 
sensitivity for follow-up of selected patients with suspected recurrent noniodine
concentrating thyroid carcinoma.

The interrenicular septum. A normal anatomical variant seen on DMSA SPECT.

Rossleigh MA(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia.

SPECT imaging has been shown to identify additional defects when applied to
Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy. However, the nature of these defects is uncertain. They
may be because of small scars or anatomical variants. The interrenicular septum
(IRS) is a normal finding that may mimic a scar on ultrasound examination or
tomography. In this study, it was found that the IRS may be identified on Tc-99m 
DMSA SPECT and that it was present in 32% of patients. Its characteristic
appearance is a linear area of absent tracer uptake extending from the renal
hilum into the parenchyma, usually anterosuperiorly. The preservation of renal
cortical uptake differentiates it from a scar, which results in a defect in the
rim of cortical Tc-99m DMSA accumulation.

Conformations of zinc chelates of meso- and rac-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in
aqueous solution.

Fang X(1), Fernando Q.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721.

rac-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was found to be superior to
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinc acid in mobilizing in vivo heavy metals such as Cd,
Hg, and Pb. The disadvantage of using rac-DMSA alone as a clinical antidote for
heavy metal poisoning is that it causes a greater loss of endogenous zinc than
its meso isomer. The difference between the two diastereoisomers of DMSA in the
excretion of endogenous zinc has been rationalized on the basis of the
differences in the conformations of their zinc complexes. The zinc complexes of
rac-DMSA in aqueous solution are more stable than the corresponding complexes of 
its meso isomer because the rac-DMSA ligands always adopt staggered anti
conformations, in which the electrostatic repulsion between two bulky carboxylate
groups is minimized; in contrast, unlike in the crystal lattice, meso-DMSA
ligands always adopt staggered gauche conformations in their zinc complexes. The 
conformations of various monomeric and dimeric zinc complexes with rac- and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in aqueous solution were determined by IR
spectroscopy and proton NMR spectroscopy as a function of zinc:ligand ratio, by
proton NMR spectroscopy as a function of pD, and by variable-temperature 13C NMR 
spectroscopy. rac-DMSA in ZnL2(6-) coordinates with zinc ion via two thiolate
groups and one carboxylate group, whereas in Zn2L2(4-) each ligand complexes two 
zinc ions by using one carboxylate group and one thiolate group in the
beta-position to bind to the same zinc ion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

A comparative study of meso- and rac-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acids and their zinc 
complexes in aqueous solution.

Fang X(1), Fernando Q.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721.

The conformations of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (meso-DMSA) in aqueous
solution have been postulated from proton NMR titrations. The complexes formed
with zinc(II) and the ligands rac-DMSA and meso-DMSA have been postulated from
potentiometric titrations of solutions containing varying ratios of zinc:ligand. 
The complex formation behavior of rac-DMSA with zinc(II) is dramatically
different from that of meso-DMSA. These differences are reflected in the complex 
formation constants of the zinc(II) species and their distributions in solution
as a function of zinc:ligand ratios and as a function of pH. On the basis of
these results we have predicted that rac-DMSA is more effective than meso-DMSA in
mobilizing lead in vivo and that the 1:2 zinc complex of rac-DMSA can be used
effectively for the treatment of heavy metal poisoning because endogenous zinc
will not be depleted by this chelation treatment.

Renal pathology and the 99mTc-DMSA image before and after treatment of the
evolving pyelonephritic scar: an experimental study.

(1)Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.

This study reports the effects of 3-weeks' antimicrobial treatment on the
pathology and appearance of the 99mTc-DMSA renal image in piglets with
pyelonephritis induced by a combination of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and
urinary infection. Before treatment, either photon-deficient (B1, B2) or
photon-absent (C) scintigraphic abnormalities were present in the refluxing
kidney in all 22 animals examined. All (100%) of the initially B1 and the
majority (71%) of B2 photon deficient defects resolved with treatment, leaving
only insignificant residual pathologic lesions. Conversely almost all (93%) of
the C photon-absent scintigraphic abnormalities persisted after treatment and
were always associated with significant scarred or cratered pathologic lesions in
the refluxing kidney at sacrifice.

Tc-99m DMSA renal scintigraphy was performed in 40 renal grafts. Cyclosporin A
and glucocorticoids were given to all patients as antirejection therapy, and 11
also were given azathioprine. The kidneys were transplanted 1 to 97 months before
the investigation. Seventy percent of kidneys had diffusely altered distribution 
of Tc-99m DMSA, and 43% had focal clear-cut parenchymal defects. The frequency of
parenchymal defects observed on the DMSA scans was higher in patients who
suffered manifest acute rejection episodes (8/16 versus 9/24 patients, borderline
significance, P < 0.06), but had no relation to the living or cadaveric donor
transplant or its function. A combination of peritubular edema and interstitial
fibrosis is considered the most probable explanation of diffuse changes. The high
frequency of clear-cut parenchymal defects most likely results from symptomatic
or asymptomatic rejection episodes complicated by renal transplant infarcts.

Monoisoamyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate as a delayed treatment for mercury
removal in rats.

Kostial K(1), Kargacin B, Blanusa M, Piasek M, Jones MM, Singh PK.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Mineral Metabolism, University of Zagreb, Croatia.

Monoisoamyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (Mi-ADMS) was found to be superior to
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in decreasing the body burden of 203Hg in
rats under conditions of early treatment. In this experiment Mi-ADMS was used as 
late treatment for mercury removal. Albino rats aged 6 weeks and 7-day-old
sucklings received a single intraperitoneal injection of 203Hg (as nitrate). Two 
weeks later they were treated with DMSA or Mi-ADMS (0.25 mmole/kg bw) on two
consecutive days. The radioactivity in the carcass (whole body after removal of
the gastrointestinal tract), liver, kidneys and brain was determined by solid
crystal gamma scintillation counting six days after chelation therapy
administration (3 weeks after 203Hg application). Both chelators reduced the body
burden of mercury compared to controls. The effect of Mi-ADMS was superior to
DMSA treatment in older rats for decreasing carcass and kidney retention, and in 
suckling rats for decreasing carcass, liver, and kidney retention. They were
equally effective in decreasing brain retention in older rats and had no effect
on brain retention in sucklings. The efficiency of Mi-ADMS in reducing the body
burden of mercury was generally higher than the efficiency of the DMSA treatment.
Therefore, Mi-ADMS deserves further attention as a late treatment for mercury
removal.

The binding of arsenite, As(III), and arsenate, As(V), by molecules in the
intracellular compartment of rabbit erythrocytes has been studied by 1H- and
31P-NMR spectroscopy, uptake of 73As, and ultrafiltration experiments. For intact
erythrocytes to which 0.1-0.4 mM arsenite was added, direct evidence was obtained
for entry of 76% within 1/2 h and subsequent binding of As(III) by intracellular 
glutathione and induced changes in the hemoglobin structure (NMR), likely due to 
binding of As(III). These results were compared with the effect of addition of
As(V) on intact erythrocytes and revealed that a smaller amount of As(V)
(approximately 25%) enters the cells; the main fraction of As(V) enters the
phosphate pathway, depletes ATP, and increases Pi. In contrast, As(III) did not
affect the ATP level. Both 1H- and 31P-NMR data indicated striking differences
between As(III) and As(V) behavior when incubated with rabbit erythrocytes. These
differences were confirmed by 73As uptake and binding experiments.

Efficacy of combined chelation in lead intoxication.

Tandon SK(1), Singh S, Jain VK.

Author information: 
(1)Industrial Toxicology Research Center, Lucknow, India.

The combination of a bone lead mobilizer, viz., CaNa2EDTA, and a soft tissue
depleter such as meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or the sodium salt of
2,3-dimercapto-1-propane-sulfonic acid (DMPS) was investigated for its efficacy
to enhance the excretion of lead, to reduce its body burden, and to reverse
certain lead-induced biochemical alterations by either of them alone in rats. The
administration of CaNa2EDTA or DMSA was more effective than that of DMPS, and the
combination of CaNa2EDTA and DMSA was more efficient than that of CaNa2EDTA and
DMPS or the individual chelators in enhancing urinary/fecal excretion of lead, in
reducing hepatic, renal, and femur concentration of lead, and in restoring
lead-induced inhibition of blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and
increase in blood zinc protoporphyrin and urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid
levels. The brain lead was depleted by DMSA only, but the combined chelation
failed to improve upon the ability of DMSA. However, chelation therapy increased 
diuresis and tissue depletion of zinc.

The value of urinalysis in differentiating acute pyelonephritis from lower
urinary tract infection in febrile infants.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nephrology, George Washington School of Medicine, Washington,
DC.

There is an ongoing debate on the best way to screen febrile infants for urinary 
tract infection. We examined the urinanalysis (UA) findings on admission among
infants less than 16 weeks old, with and without acute pyelonephritis (APN), as
defined by the dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan findings, performed
during a 57-month period. Forty-nine cases with a positive DMSA scan were
compared with 79 negative study cases. A negative UA for leukocytes (< 5 white
blood cells/high power field) was found in 4 of 49 (8.1%) cases with APN by DMSA,
and in 34 of 79 (43%) cases with a negative DMSA (odds ratio 10.88 (95%
confidence interval, 2.31 to 70.3; P < 0.001)). Three of the 4 infants not
suspected to have APN by their UA findings would have been admitted for a full
sepsis workup based on their clinical presentation and/or their laboratory
findings on admission. We conclude that a fresh UA may be a sufficient screening 
method for the exclusion of APN in infants assessed for fever of no obvious
origin.

Over the past 4 years 18 children were observed at the La Timone-Enfants Hospital
in Marseille with renal lesions consequent to nonpenetrating abdominal traumas.
Hematuria was reported in 14 cases (7 macroscopic and 7 microscopic) and all
cases suffered from abdominal and/or lumbar pain. In relation to the diagnostic
iter used: 18 echographies, 15 urographies, 13 TAC, 2 ascendant pyelographies, 2 
scintigraphies with DMSA, 1 echo-Doppler and one angiography were performed.
Renal lesions were classified as: 8 type 1, 5 type 2, 4 type 3, 1 type 4. Four
cases were operated and one case underwent percutaneous drainage of an
urohematoma. Following an analysis of these case and a revision of the
literature, the authors emphasise that the evolution and progress in the
diagnosis and treatment of this important aspect of traumatic pathology in
children enables an almost complete recovery of kidney function in almost all
cases.

Developmental toxicity evaluation of monoisoamyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate in 
mice.

Bosque MA(1), Domingo JL, Corbella J, Jones MM, Singh PK.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Toxicology and Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Rovira i
Virgili University, Reus, Spain.

Monoisoamyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (Mi-ADMS), a new dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) analog with enhanced lipophilic properties, was evaluated for potential
developmental toxicity. Intraperitoneal injections of Mi-ADMS were given to
female Swiss mice (0, 47.5, 95, and 190 mg/kg) on gestational d 6-15. The
maternal clinical status was monitored daily during treatment. At termination
(gestational d 18), dams were evaluated for clinical status and gestational
outcome. Each live fetus was weighed and examined for external, visceral, and
skeletal abnormalities. Although no maternal mortality was observed, treatment
with 95 and 190 mg/kg resulted in maternal toxicity, manifested as reduced body
weight gain during treatment and increased relative liver weight. Embryo/fetal
toxicity, consisting of a significant increase in the number of late resorptions 
as well as in the percentage of postimplantation loss, reduced (nonsignificant)
fetal body weight, and an increase in the incidence of skeletal defects, was also
observed at 190 mg/kg/d. However, no treatment-related external or soft-tissue
malformations or developmental variations were found in any group. The
no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for maternal toxicity was 47.5 mg/kg/d, 
whereas the NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 95 mg/kg/d. These results
indicate that Mi-ADMS did not produce developmental toxicity in mice in the
absence of maternal toxicity.

Comment in
    J Pediatr. 1994 Aug;125(2):233-4.

We compared the pharmacokinetics of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in
three children with lead poisoning, three adults with lead poisoning, and five
healthy adult volunteers. All subjects received DMSA orally. Maximum blood
concentration and time to maximum blood concentration of total DMSA concentration
were not statistically different among the groups. Unaltered DMSA was detected in
the blood of all poisoned patients but in only one of five healthy volunteers.
Elimination half-life of total DMSA (parent drug plus oxidized metabolites) was
longer in children with lead poisoning (3.0 +/- 0.2 hours) than in adults with
lead poisoning (1.9 +/- 0.4 hours) and healthy adults (2.0 +/- 0.2 hours). Renal 
clearance of total DMSA was greater in healthy adults (77.0 +/- 13.2 ml/min per
square meter) than in either adults (24.7 +/- 3.3 ml/min per square meter) or
children with lead poisoning (16.6 ml/min per square meter); renal clearance of
the metabolites of DMSA was also greater in healthy adults (64.6 +/- 10.1 ml/min 
per square meter) than in either adults (35.4 +/- 8.4 ml/min per square meter) or
children with lead poisoning (19.5 ml/min per square meter). The DMSA appeared to
enter the erythrocytes of patients with lead poisoning to a greater extent than
in healthy adults. We conclude that renal clearance of DMSA and its metabolites
may be impaired and that the distribution of DMSA in children with lead poisoning
may be different from that in adults.

The selective use of dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans in children with
vesicoureteral reflux.

Scherz HC(1), Downs TM, Caesar R.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Urology, Children's Hospital and Health Center, San
Diego, California.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans were performed on 75 children (115
refluxing renal units) to determine the efficacy of routine scanning in patients 
with various grades of vesicoureteral reflux. Cystourethrography demonstrated
grades I and II reflux in 75 renal units and grades III to V in 40. Of the
patients 51 presented with febrile urinary tract infection and 24 were
asymptomatic (patients presenting with nonfebrile urinary tract infections or
those undergoing sibling screening). Renal ultrasounds were performed in 60
patients. All patients were initially managed with medical therapy and 19 (25%)
ultimately underwent antireflux surgery. DMSA scans demonstrated scarring in 17
of 40 renal units (43%) of patients with high grade vesicoureteral reflux and 6
of 75 renal units (8%) of those with low grade reflux. Renal ultrasounds that
were interpreted as normal always correlated to a normal DMSA scan in
asymptomatic patients. In patients presenting with febrile urinary tract
infections the correlation between ultrasound and DMSA scan was inconsistent. We 
advocate a tailored approach in the evaluation of patients with vesicoureteral
reflux. Renal sonography may be sufficient in the assessment of renal scarring in
asymptomatic patients with reflux and those with low grade reflux. Conversely, in
patients with high grade vesicoureteral reflux, a history of febrile urinary
tract infections and abnormal renal ultrasound DMSA renal scans appear to be most
useful.

To answer the question about the best therapeutic procedure in duplex

group we summarized the patients operated from 1971 to 1986. These infants and
children were compared to a group operated from 1987 to 1992. In the first group 
the operative procedure was chosen according to the presence or absence of reflux
into the lower pole system. All patients with reflux were corrected radically in 
one operation. The control showed a reoperation rate of 45% (8 of 18 patients). 3
patients lost a functioning renal unit. In the second group the operative
procedure was chosen according to the function of the upper pole. It was resected
if its function was below 10% measured by DMSA-scintigraphy. In cases with
functioning upper pole a pyeloureterostomy was performed. Only in two cases the
ureterocele was resected primarily. In this group a second operation was
necessary in only 3 of 16 patients and renal function was preserved in all cases.
Our results show that radical surgery in duplex ureteroceles is seldom necessary 
and a staged procedure is the method of choice.

Paediatric nuclear medicine procedures: routine sedation or management of
anxiety?

Pintelon H(1), Jonckheer MH, Piepsz A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, AZ VUB, Brussels, Belgium.

In our department, examinations of long duration are performed without sedation. 
It is exceptional that a test has to be postponed because of lack of cooperation 
by the patient. Good quality images, taking into account the recommended
paediatric amounts of radioactivity, are achieved for procedures such as MIBG
whole body scanning (10 min frame-1), gastro-oesophageal reflux studies (60 min
acquisition), renography and furosemide challenge (45 min) or pinhole views for
bone or renal DMSA studies (20-30 min). While drug sedation remains in some
conditions the only way to obtain a satisfactory nuclear medicine examination in 
children, we still believe that in most cases this can be achieved by taking the 
emotional life of the child into account. For that purpose, people in charge of
the paediatric procedure have to be adequately trained.

The value of ultrasound in the child with an acute urinary tract infection.

MacKenzie JR(1), Fowler K, Hollman AS, Tappin D, Murphy AV, Beattie TJ, Azmy AF.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of an ultrasound examination in children with a
proven urinary tract infection.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The results of renal ultrasound and
99mTc-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) studies were compared in 112 children with 
a first documented symptomatic Escherichia coli urinary tract infection.
RESULTS: Ultrasound was particularly effective in detecting the presence of
obstruction, renal swelling and parenchymal change consistent with acute
pyelonephritis. However, ultrasound failed to detect half of the kidneys with
photon deficient areas on 99mTc DMSA scan and was unreliable in detecting the
presence of scarring.
CONCLUSION: An ultrasound examination alone should not be relied on in the child 
with an acute urinary tract infection.

The radionuclide assessment of pre-natally diagnosed hydronephrosis.

Upsdell SM(1), Gupta S, Gough DC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Pendlebury, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if a pre-operative non-invasive radionuclide study can
predict the results of surgery in infants with pre-natally diagnosed
hydronephrosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight male infants with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis
were treated by pyeloplasty within the first 4 months of life. All infants
underwent a pre-operative diuresis renogram and a dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA)
scan, followed by a further renogram 6 months after surgery to assess renal
function and drainage.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the results of the relative
renal function estimates obtained by the pre-operative renogram and the
pre-operative DMSA scan (P = 0.001). In all patients the recovery in renal
function following surgery was accurately predicted by the pre-operative DMSA
scan.
CONCLUSION: The results of this preliminary study suggest that a pre-operative
DMSA scan could replace the use of invasive nephrostomy drainage to assess the
potential for recovery in the poorly functioning neonatal kidney and give an
indication of those kidneys most likely to benefit from reconstructive surgery.

99Tcm-DMSA as a dynamic imaging agent for estimating renal blood flow. A
comparison with 99Tcm-DTPA.

Bunce CJ(1), Godley ML, Snell ME.

Author information: 
(1)Urology Unit, Institute of Child Health, London, UK.

A technique for estimating fractional renal blood flow (RBF) from the early part 
of the 99Tcm-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) renogram has been described
previously and its reproducibility validated in the pig model. The technique is
assumed to be applicable to any recirculating gamma-emitting tracer compound. The
aim of this study was to determine whether the same method could be applied to
99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) which has been largely neglected as a
dynamic imaging agent. Paired estimates of fractional RBF were obtained in Large 
White (n = 16) and Göttingen miniature pigs (n = 6) in three groups: group 1,
paired 99Tcm-DTPA studies; group 2, paired 99Tcm-DMSA studies; group 3, alternate
99Tcm-DTPA and 99Tcm-DMSA studies. The results showed good agreement between
paired results independent of whether 99Tcm-DTPA or 99Tcm-DMSA was used,
supporting the assumption that the technique is applicable to any recirculating
gamma-emitting tracer compound. The demonstration that fractional RBF can be
reliably estimated from the DMSA renogram means that, if required, it may be
combined in a single nuclear medicine procedure with conventional static DMSA
renal imaging.

Beryllium-induced biochemical alterations and their prevention following
co-administration of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid or 2,3-dimercaptopropane
sulphonate in rats.

(1)School of Studies in Zoology, Jiwaji University, Gwalior, India.

The effects of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 2,3-dimercaptopropane 
sulphonate (DMPS) on body beryllium burden, hepatic lipid peroxidation,
glutathione, alkaline and acid phosphatase and some biochemical variables of
porphyrin metabolism were studied in beryllium-poisoned rats. It was observed
that beryllium poisoning is associated with a slight increase in lipid
peroxidation, significant depletion of alkaline phosphatase and elevation of acid
phosphatase activities in the liver and increased beryllium concentration in
blood and other soft organs. Evidence is presented that both DMSA and DMPS during
concomitant administration prevented most of the above beryllium-induced
biochemical alterations. Tissue beryllium concentration and histopathological
lesions in liver and kidneys were also significantly less marked following
simultaneous administration of DMPS compared to beryllium-exposed controls; DMSA 
was comparatively less effective.

Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid and ifosfamide tubular dysfunction in
children with cancer.

Royen EA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatrics, Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Centre,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Quantitative 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy was
used to asses ifosfamide-induced changes in renal function in 11 children who
received chemotherapy for various malignancies. Serial measurements of absolute
99mTc-DMSA renal uptake, calculated on conjugated views, were performed during
and after chemotherapy. Data of 37 studies obtained before and at different
cumulative dose levels of ifosfamide were analysed in relation to clinical and
biochemical parameters. A highly significant relationship between 99mTc-DMSA
uptake and cumulative ifosfamide dose was found (P < 0.001). The most frequently 
observed abnormal pattern on scintigraphic images was decreased kidney uptake
together with increased accumulation in bladder. 99mTc-DMSA uptake was more
consistent than beta 2-microglobulin values in urine and more sensitive than
quantitative hyperaminoaciduria and tubular resorption of phosphate for the
detection of ifosfamide-induced tubular dysfunction. 99mTc-DMSA uptake was
decreased in both patients with and patients without clinical toxicity.
Persistently reduced 99mTc-DMSA uptake was observed in four patients during
follow-up; in one of them, who was asymptomatic after ifosfamide therapy, sudden 
onset of Fanconi syndrome was observed when he was retreated with carboplatin 1
year later. It is concluded that 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy is a suitable
method to assess progressive ifosfamide-induced tubular injury whereas
scintigraphic imaging is helpful for interpreting renal uptake changes. The test 
is able to detect subclinical injury and may potentially predict high risk at
retreatment.

within 24 h. Fecal excretion was not significantly elevated vs control. Tissue
radioactivities showed a remarkable decrease in the levels of 210Pb and 203Hg in

Metal-induced developmental toxicity in mammals: a review.

Domingo JL(1).

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Toxicology and Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Rovira i
Virgili University, Reus, Spain.

It is well established that certain metals are toxic to embryonic and fetal
tissues and can induce teratogenicity in mammals. The main objective of this
paper has been to summarize the toxic effects that excesses of certain metals may
cause on mammalian development. The reviewed elements have been divided into four
groups: (a) metals of greatest toxicological significance (arsenic, cadmium,
lead, mercury, and uranium) that are wide-spread in the human environment, (b)
essential trace metals (chromium, cobalt, manganese, selenium, and zinc), (c)
other metals with evident biological interest (nickel and vanadium), and (d)
metals of pharmacological interest (aluminum, gallium, and lithium). A summary of
the therapeutic use of chelating agents in the prevention of metal-induced
developmental toxicity has also been included. meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) and sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) have been reported to 
be effective in alleviating arsenic- and mercury-induced teratogenesis, whereas
sodium 4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonate (Tiron) would protect against
vanadium- and uranium-induced developmental toxicity.

Multicystic dysplastic kidney: another application of 99mTc MAG3.

Tyrrell PN(1), Boivin CM, Burrell DN, Mountford PJ, Chapman S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital, Birmingham.

The value of 99mTechnetium-mercapto acetyl triglycine (99mTcMAG3) in the
investigation of 10 children with suspected multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) 
has been assessed. The condition has to be distinguished from hydronephrosis,
usually caused by pelviureteric junction obstruction. Based on our findings, we
propose that 99mTc MAG3 replace 99mTc DMSA because it allows a better assessment 
of the contralateral kidney and permits a full assessment where the diagnosis is 
hydronephrosis rather than MCDK.

The significance of vesicoureteric reflux on kidney development assessed by
dimercaptosuccinate renal scintigraphy.

Wallin L(1), Bajc M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Clinical Physiology, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of vesicoureteric reflux on kidney parenchyma
and renal length, and identify typical distribution patterns by
dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) renal scintigraphy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: DMSA renal scintigraphies in 101 children (152 renal units)
with vesicoureteric reflux grade 1-5 were reviewed.
RESULTS: Three main types of pathological DMSA patterns were found: (i)
dysplasia; (ii) medial defect; and (iii) pole defects. In children with no
history of pyelonephritis a normal distribution pattern was found in 31%,
dysplasia in 23%, medial defect in 25%, pole defects in 17% and no typical
pattern in 4%. In those with a history of pyelonephritis a normal distribution
pattern was found in 28%, dysplasia in 24%, medial defect in 21%, pole defects in
24% and no typical pattern in 3%. A normal pattern was significantly more
frequent in kidneys with reflux grade 1-2. Dysplasia was significantly more
frequent in kidneys with reflux grade 4-5. In children with no history of
pyelonephritis 42% of the renal units had reduced length, 8% with no other sign
of pathology. The frequency of reduced kidney length at reflux grade 1-2 did not 
differ significantly from that at higher grades of reflux. In children with a
history of pyelonephritis 52% of the renal units had reduced length, 13% with no 
other sign of pathology. The frequency of reduced kidney length with a normal
DMSA pattern did not differ significantly from that with a pathological pattern.
CONCLUSION: The pathological DMSA distribution with vesicoureteric reflux
generally conforms to one of three main patterns. Reduced kidney length is
frequent even at lower grades of vesicoureteric reflux even in patients with no
history of pyelonephritis, and can be the only sign of pathology.

Design of in vivo cadmium-mobilizing agents: synthesis and properties of
monobenzyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate.

Jones MM(1), Singh PK, Basinger MA, Gale GR, Smith AB, Harris WR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37235.

A novel method for the synthesis of monoesters of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) is presented which utilizes the reaction of the vicinal
sulfhydryl-protected anhydride with the corresponding alcohol in the presence of 
a base. The product is then treated successively with mercuric chloride to remove
the protecting group and form the mercuric complex, and hydrogen sulfide to
regenerate thiol groups by removal of mercury as HgS. This strategy was exploited
to synthesize monobenzyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (MBzDMS),
C6H5CH2O(O)CCH(SH)CH(SH)C(O)OH, and demonstrates a feasible synthesis of
monoesters difficult to obtain by direct esterification, via the use of the
reactive anhydride. The resultant compound was found to be an effective
cadminum-mobilizing agent when used with cadmium-exposed rats or mice and when
administered by any one of several routes (ip, iv, po). This monobenzyl ester
(MBzDMS) of DMSA was found to be somewhat less effective than the corresponding
monoisoamyl ester (Mi-ADMS) in mobilizing cadmium from such cadmium deposits. The
ability of MBzDMS to mobilize cadmium into the urine is significantly decreased
by the coadministration of p-aminobenzoic acid, in support of the hypothesis that
MBzDMS enters renal cells via an anion transport system. An analysis of the
structural features of vicinal dithiols examined as antagonists for chronic
cadmium intoxication allows a hypothesis to be formulated indicating essential
features required for the design of effective new cadmium antagonists of this
type.

A comparative study of evaluating renal scars by 99mTc-DMSA planar and SPECT
renal scans, intravenous urography, and ultrasonography.

Yen TC(1), Chen WP, Chang SL, Huang YC, Hsieh CP, Yeh SH, Lin CY.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan,
Republic of China.

The purpose of this prospective study is to compare 3 types of 99mTc-DMSA renal
scan [(a) planar, (b) x-ray type film static SPECT presentation (SPECT-1) and (c)
dynamic three-view display of SPECT slices (SPECT-2)], intravenous urography, and
ultrasonography in the diagnosis of renal scars. All these studies were performed
in 130 pediatric patients, with urinary tract infection (42 patients),
vesicoureteral reflux (37), and unilateral or bilateral small kidney(s) (51). The
number of renal scars detected was highest with the 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT-1 scan
and next came the 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT-2 studies. There is a significant
difference (p < 0.05) between the ability of planar and SPECT-1 to recognize
renal defects. However, SPECT-2 may provide the best stereotactic localization
and image quality of all the methods.

Imaging in systemic hypertension in paediatrics.

Gordon I(1).

Author information: 
(1)Hospital for Sick Children, London, UK.

The role of imaging is to establish the cause of systemic hypertension, the main 
focus being the kidneys. All children require a Doppler ultrasound examination
followed by a radioisotope study, usually 99mTc-DMSA. This combination will
resolve most clinical situations. There is no role for the intravenous urogram in
the majority of children. Arteriography and renal vein renin sampling are
reserved for a small proportion of children. Imaging should always start with the
least invasive procedure with the lowest radiation burden and high radiation
techniques reserved for selected cases. The use of ACE inhibition may allow the
diagnosis of renovascular disease in paediatrics noninvasively.

Scintigraphy using gallium-67 (67Ga) citrate and penvaralent technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid ([99mTc(V)]DMSA) and other radiological examinations were
performed in three patients with solitary muscular sarcoidosis who had tumor-like
muscular lesions. Although distinction from other invasive soft tissue tumors was
difficult using plain and enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance
imaging, marked uptake of 67Ga and moderate uptake of [99mTc(V)]DMSA were shown
at the sites of granulomatous inflammatory lesions of sarcoidosis. Both 67Ga and 
[99mTc(V)]DMSA scintigraphy could be of value in the diagnosis and detection of
distribution of granulomas of sarcoidosis in the soft tissue and in determining
the appropriate region for biopsy.

Does routine ultrasound have a role in the investigation of children with urinary
tract infection?

Mucci B(1), Maguire B.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Diagnostic Radiology, West Cumberland Hospital, Whitehaven,
Cumbria.

The results of investigations in children with urinary tract infection (UTI) were
studied in a district general hospital in order to assess the relative value of
the two most widely used screening tests, namely ultrasound (US) and 99mTc
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. A total of 193 children had
undergone both US and DMSA scintigraphy as part of an investigation of proven
single or multiple urinary tract infections over a 27 month period. DMSA
scintigraphy revealed abnormalities in 22 of the children (11%). The
abnormalities ranged from cortical defects to congenital anatomical
abnormalities. US revealed abnormalities in six children (3%) but did not
contribute any additional information in any. In our institution, the DMSA
scintigram alone would have been an adequate screening test for children with
UTI. Hydronephrosis is a common abnormality detected by US. Although none were
seen in the study group, several children were examined during the study period
with dilated collecting systems detected at ante-natal US. No cases of
hydronephrosis presented as UTI. We question whether the use of routine US is
justifiable in the investigation of children with UTI, and discuss whether a more
selective investigation protocol should be adopted.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem,
Israel.

In-111 pentetreotide scintigraphy of 10 patients with residual or metastatic
medullary thyroid carcinoma is described. Six patients had sporadic tumor and 4
had MEN IIB. Foci of increased tracer uptake were observed in 9 patients: in the 
thyroid bed (4 patients), the mediastinum (3 patients.), the shoulder area and
left lower abdomen (1 patient), and the left upper abdomen (1 patient). The 10th 
patient had no abnormal uptake. CT confirmed 2 mediastinal lesions and 2 out of 3
thyroid masses, but did not detect the thyroid remnants or the lesions in the
shoulder area and abdomen. Lung lesions < or = 1 cm in diameter and ill-defined
liver foci (2 patients) were seen on CT, but not on scintigraphy. Small liver
metastases not demonstrated on CT or on scintigraphy were identified at surgery
in a MEN IIB patient. Elevated urinary epinephrine was found in 2 out of 4 MEN
IIB patients. In one, tracer uptake in the left adrenal corresponded to a mass on
CT, to pathological uptake of MIBG and DMSA, and to a tumor removed at surgery.
The second patient had peritoneal spread of malignant pheochromocytoma (at
surgery), but negative CT and only a single focus in the left lower abdomen on
scintigraphy. Somatostatin-receptor imaging is useful for the detection of
residual and recurrent medullary thyroid carcinoma, and may identify
pheochromocytoma in MEN IIB patients.

Evaluation of three antidotes on arsenic toxicity in the common earthworm
(Lumbricus terrestris).

Li W(1), Chien PK, Furst A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, University of San Francisco, CA 94117-1080.

The common earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris) is being evaluated in our
laboratories as a substitute for mice in metal toxicity studies. These two
disparate species have enzymes in common, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase 
and glutathione-S-transferase. Also, worms respond similarly to these rodents for
selenium and nickel toxicity. Worms are less sensitive, however, to metal
toxicity. In this study earthworms were challenged with three different arsenic
compounds: arsenite, arsenate and the vesicant phenyldichloroarsine (PDA). The
median lethal dose for each arsenic compound was determined. The order of
toxicity of the arsenic compounds to the worms was PDA > arsenite > arsenate (24 
h LD50 values were 189.5, 191.0 and 519.4 mumol kg-1, respectively). Individual
mammalian dithiol antidotes, namely the sodium salt of
2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
or 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (BAL), were injected into the worms 5 min after
various doses of the arsenic compound were administered. The decreases in acute
toxicity values were recorded. All three antidotes protected the worms against
arsenic toxicity with varying degrees of effectiveness. The protective action for
the inorganic arsenic compounds was in the order DMPS > DMSA > BAL. For the
organic arsenical, PDA, the most effective antidote was BAL.

Effect of chelate treatments on kidney, bone and brain lead levels of
lead-intoxicated mice.

Jones MM(1), Basinger MA, Gale GR, Atkins LM, Smith AB, Stone A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37235.

The effects of chelating agent treatment with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA), Na2CaEDTA, Na2ZnEDTA, and Na3ZnDTPA on the organ lead levels of
lead-loaded mice have been determined. At 1 mmol/kg/day i.p., all caused
reductions in the lead levels of the kidney after four injections, but only
Na2CaEDTA produced a significant reduction in brain lead. All chelating agents
caused significant reductions in kidney and brain lead levels when administered
at a daily dose of 1 mmol/kg/day for eight days, but only DMSA reduced the bone
lead level. In animals given 50 mg Pb/kg or 100 mg Pb/kg, the administration of
Na2CaEDTA or DMSA at 1 mmol/kg/day x 8 produced significant reductions in kidney,
bone and brain lead levels, but DMSA produced greater reductions of bone lead in 
both groups and of kidney lead in the group given 100 mg Pb/kg. An examination of
published data describing the effect of chelating agent treatment on brain lead
levels indicates that DMSA produces a reduction in brain lead levels under all
conditions examined to date.

Effect of chelation treatment with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on lead-related
blood pressure changes.

An elevation in mean blood pressure was found in rats treated with low lead
(0.01%) for 6 months and then only water for an additional 6 months
(discontinuous low lead). No change in blood pressure was found in rats similarly
treated with high lead (0.5%) (discontinuous high lead). Administration of DMSA
(0.5% in drinking water), for 5 days every 2 months following cessation of lead
administration, resulted in a significant lowering of blood pressure in both
groups of animals. In the low-lead but not the high-lead group, this was
associated with an increase in plasma cyclic GMP (acting as a second messenger
for endothelium-derived relaxing factor, EDRF) and a decrease in the plasma
concentration of a 12-kDa hypertension-associated protein. Plasma endothelin-3
(ET-3) levels were decreased in discontinuous high-lead rats, increased in
discontinuous low-lead rats, but were unaltered by DMSA treatment. We infer that 
the elevated blood pressure in the discontinuous low-lead rats is related to an
increase in the putative vasoconstrictors, ET-3 and the hypertension-associated
protein, without a change in the vasodilator, EDRF. With DMSA treatment, plasma
cyclic GMP in low-lead rats increased above normal, and the
hypertension-associated protein decreased, resulting in lowered blood pressure.
DMSA was shown to act as an antioxidant in vitro. Thus the DMSA effect on plasma 
cGMP (EDRF) may occur via a scavenging effect on EDRF-inactivating reactive
oxygen species.

infection (UTI) and compared with the technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) renal scan results, in order to evaluate a noninvasive means to
localize the site of UTI. Increased urinary B2M and NAG were not associated with 
renal inflammation (pyelonephritis), as defined by positive dimercaptosuccinic
acid scan. Median NAG concentrations were 114.2 mumol/hour/mg creatinine (CR)
(range, 5.7 to 305.4) in 17 febrile UTI patients vs. 13.8 (range, 3.4 to 104.3)
in 17 age and sex-matched febrile controls with negative urine cultures, P =
0.0001. The sensitivity and specificity of NAG > or = 40 mumol/hour/mg of CR in
predicting UTI in febrile patients, regardless of the site of infection, were 88 
and 88%, respectively. Increased urinary NAG is associated with UTI in febrile
patients regardless of the level of infection (scan status), and may be an
informative indicator of UTI.

Multiple pathways of electron transfer in dimethyl sulfoxide reductase of
Escherichia coli.

Trieber CA(1), Rothery RA, Weiner JH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

The catalytic subunit of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) reductase, DmsA, contains six
blocks of sequence that are homologous to other members of the superfamily of
prokaryotic molybdoenzymes. The amino-terminal block contains 5 conserved
residues (Cys38, Cys42, Cys75, Lys28, and Arg77). Site-directed mutagenesis of
these residues did not alter membrane localization but in some cases less enzyme 
accumulated. The activity of Me2SO reductase was monitored by measuring
Me2SO-dependent anaerobic growth, benzyl viologen, or dimethylnaphthoquinol
oxidase activity, and using a quinol pool-coupling assay. Only Cys75 and Lys28
mutant enzymes were able to support anaerobic growth with Me2SO suggesting a
critical role for Cys38, Cys42, and Arg77. Benzyl viologen oxidase activity was
retained in the mutants although with reduced efficiency in Cys42-Ser. Electron
transport with dimethylnaphthoquinol was reduced in Cys38-Ser, Cys42-Ser, and
Cys75-Ser and almost totally eliminated in the Arg77-Ser mutant. Cys38-Ser,
Cys42-Ser, and Arg77-Ser were unable to support quinol oxidation although
electron transfer from the quinol pool to the [Fe-S] centers in DmsB was normal. 
These results indicate that the amino-terminal region is involved in functional
electron transfer from the quinol pool to Me2SO and that electrons from benzyl
viologen, dimethylnaphthoquinol, and menaquinol may follow different paths within
the catalytic subunit.

Renal pathology and the 99mTc-DMSA image during the evolution of the early
pyelonephritic scar: an experimental study.

Risdon RA(1), Godley ML, Parkhouse HF, Gordon I, Ransley PG.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.

This study describes the pathologic changes underlying the appearances of the
99mTc-DMSA renal image during acute pyelonephritis induced in piglets by a
combination of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and urinary infection. In a total of
42 animals examined, pathologic lesions were identified in 36 of the 46 kidneys
subjected to VUR and urinary infection, but no lesions developed in the remaining
10 refluxing kidneys. While scintigraphic defects were invariably associated with
pyelonephritic lesions (specificity 100%), some small lesions were not identified
(sensitivity 80%). There was a significant association (p = < 0.001) between the 
degree of photon deficiency seen scintigraphically and the histologic changes
(early and late lesions). However, the scintigraphic appearance of individual
lesions was also influenced by factors such as their extent and density, so that 
consideration of the macroscopic characteristics was also important for precise
correlation.

How good is technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine indirect cystography?

Author information:

The aim of the present study was to estimate the sensitivity of indirect
radionuclide cystography (IRC) performed with technetium-99m
mercaptoacetyl-triglycine (MAG3), in comparison with the micturition
cystourethrography (MCUG) and direct radionuclide cystography (DRC), for the
diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux. Two groups of patients were selected: group I
comprised 40 children who underwent IRC during the acute phase of urinary tract
infection and an MCUG 6 weeks later; group II comprised 42 (other) children with 
known reflux, who underwent IRC and DRC during follow-up. Taking as the reference
the total number of refluxing kidneys detected by means of any cystographic
technique, 99mTc-MAG3 ICR missed two-thirds of the refluxing kidneys. Most of the
small refluxes were missed, but so too were 50% of the major refluxes. Taking as 
the reference 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, MCUG detected
91% of the patients with DMSA abnormalities on at least one kidney, DRC detected 
95%, and IRC detected 46% and 43% respectively, in groups I and II. The use of
99mTc-MAG3 IRC as the sole technique for the detection of vesicoureteric reflux
gives rise to an unacceptable number of false-negative results.

Synthesis, structure, and properties of rac-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, a
potentially useful chelating agent for toxic metals.

Fang X(1), Fernando Q.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721.

rac-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (rac-DMSA) may be a more effective antidote for
the treatment of heavy metal poisoning than meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(meso-DMSA), which is used at present. A comparative study of these two chelating
agents has been undertaken in order to investigate this possibility. The
structures of rac-DMSA and the precursor in its synthesis,
rac-2,3-bis(acetylthio)succinic acid, have been determined by single-crystal
X-ray analysis and compared with the structures of the corresponding meso
compounds. The concentration distributions of the various ionic and molecular
species of rac-DMSA that are present in aqueous solutions in the pH range
1.8-12.8 have been calculated from the four acid dissociation constants that have
been determined potentiometrically at an ionic strength of 0.10. The
conformations of these species in aqueous solutions have been determined by 1H
NMR spectroscopy as a function of pH. The rac-DMSA exists in the crystal lattice 
as a double-stranded structure in which each molecule is in a gauche
configuration. The meso-DMSA, however, exists in a single strand in which each
molecule has adopted an anti configuration and the individual molecules are
joined together at each end by hydrogen bonds. These differences in the
conformations of rac- and meso-DMSA may account for the significant difference in
the solubilities of the two compounds in aqueous solutions. In acidic solutions
at elevated temperatures of about 95 degrees C, rac-DMSA is slowly but
irreversibly converted to meso-DMSA. This conversion does not occur at ambient
temperatures.

DMSA administration to patients with alleged mercury poisoning from dental
amalgams: a placebo-controlled study.

O, Larsson KS.

Author information:

Sweden.

The present investigation was performed to determine the effect of 14-day oral
administration of meso-2.3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on the urinary mercury 
excretion and the potential reduction of blood and plasma mercury concentrations,
and also to relate these effects to possible decrease of symptoms, allegedly
associated with amalgam fillings. Twenty subjects, relating their symptoms to
mercury from amalgam fillings, received 20 mg/kg DMSA or placebo for 14 days.
Their symptoms and mood states were recorded during the study and at a check-up 3
months later. Interpretation was based on intra-individual differences.
DMSA-treatment resulted in an average increase in urinary mercury excretion by
65% and a decrease in blood mercury levels of 0.04 microgram/L/day. At the
check-up after 3 months, urinary mercury excretion had returned to the
pre-treatment level. No treatment effect of DMSA was apparent on subjective
symptoms and mood state. One statistically significant treatment effect was
noted-a decrease in fatigue-inertia in the DMSA-group-but there was no
demonstrable correlation with increased urinary excretion or decreased blood
concentration of mercury. Three subjects showed hypersensitive reactions,
probably DMSA-specific, at the end of the treatment period. This
placebo-controlled study provides no scientific support for diagnostic or
therapeutic administration of DMSA for symptoms allegedly associated with chronic
mercury exposition from dental amalgam fillings.

Comment in
    J Nucl Med. 1994 Mar;35(3):449-50.

Quantitative SPECT was used to evaluate renal functional volume (cc), percent of 
injected dose/cc (%ID/cc) and renal uptake (%) in 11 children with unilateral
vesicoureteral reflux grade 3 or greater, and in 19 normal control children
without reflux.METHODS: Studies were performed 4-6 hr after intravenous injection
of 0.750-2 mCi of 99mTc-DMSA.
RESULTS: Control kidneys (n = 38) had a volume of 99.7 +/- 29.5 cc. The %ID/cc
was 0.27 +/- 0.08, and the uptake in one kidney was 24.8% +/- 3.9%. Global renal 
uptake (right plus left) was 49.6% +/- 7.3%. Functional volume of the control
kidneys showed an increase with age, and the %ID/cc showed a steeper decrease
with age, resulting in a trend of the kidney uptake to decrease with age. Kidneys
with reflux had a decreased kidney uptake of 15.7% +/- 29.5%, compared to age-
and sex-matched controls (t = 4.7, p < 0.001). The contralateral kidneys without 
reflux had a significantly increased total uptake of 33.4% +/- 6.8% as compared
to controls (t = 3.44, p < 0.01). Global uptake by the kidneys was 49.2% +/- 8.6%
and was not statistically different from controls (t = 1.0, ns).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that SPECT quantitation of 99mTc-DMSA uptake in
each kidney separately could be used as a noninvasive method to assess impairment
and compensation of the function of the individual kidney in children with
vesicoureteral reflux.

TMAO anaerobic respiration in Escherichia coli: involvement of the tor operon.

Méjean V(1), Iobbi-Nivol C, Lepelletier M, Giordano G, Chippaux M, Pascal MC.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratoire de Chimie Bactérienne, CNRS, Marseille, France.

The trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) respiratory system is subject to a strict
positive control by the substrate. This property was exploited in the performance
of miniMu replicon-mediated in vivo cloning of the promoter region of gene(s)
positively regulated by TMAO. This region, located at 22 min on the chromosome,
was shown to control the expression of a transcription unit composed of three
open reading frames, designated torC, torA and torD, respectively. The presence
of five putative c-type haem-binding sites within the TorC sequence, as well as
the specific biochemical characterization, indicated that torC encodes a 43,300
Da c-type cytochrome. The second open reading frame, torA, was identified as the 
structural gene for TMAO reductase. A comparison of the predicted amino-terminal 
sequence of the torA gene product to that of the purified TMAO reductase
indicated cleavage of a 39 amino acid signal peptide, which is in agreement with 
the periplasmic location of the enzyme. The predicted TorA protein contains the
five molybdenum cofactor-binding motifs found in other molybdoproteins and
displays extensive sequence homology with BisC and DmsA proteins. As expected,
insertions in torA led to the loss of TMAO reductase. The 22,500 Da polypeptides 
encoded by the third open reading frame does not share any similarity with
proteins listed in data banks.

Comment in
    J Pediatr. 1994 Aug;125(2):333-4.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the response to oral meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) treatment in children with an initial blood lead (BPb) concentration less 
than versus more than 2.17 mumol/L (45 micrograms/dl).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Regional referral lead treatment program in an urban children's
hospital.
PATIENTS: Thirty consecutive children, median age 34 months (range, 5 to 161
months), with an initial BPb concentration 0.97 to 2.90 mumol/L (20 to 60
micrograms/dl) selected for DMSA use. Reasons for DMSA use included BPb
concentration > 2.17 mumol/L (11 children), complications with penicillamine
therapy (11), chronic renal failure (1), and compassionate use (7). All patients 
received required environmental hazard reductions before drug administration.
RESULTS: Group 1 (n = 23) had a mean BPb concentration of 1.50 mumol/L (31
micrograms/dl), and group 2 (n = 7) had a mean BPb concentration of 2.41 (51
micrograms/dl). Sixteen patients (70%) in group 1 and five patients (71%) in
group 2 had had previous chelation therapy (p value not significant). No
significant difference was found in the mean percentage of the reduction of BPb
concentration during treatment of group 1 (60%) versus group 2 (58%). The mean
BPb concentration in group 1 rebounded to 70% of pretreatment values by mean day 
41; the BPb concentration in group 2 rebounded to 69% by day 37 (p value not
significant). Prior chelation therapy did not result in a significant difference 
in either the percentage reduction of BPb concentration or the percentage of
rebound BPb.
CONCLUSION: DMSA is equally effective in acutely lowering BPb concentration in
children with BPb concentrations less than and greater than 2.17 mumol/L.

Cadmium mobilization by monoaralkyl- and monoalkyl esters of
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and by a dithiocarbamate.

Jones MM(1), Singh PK, Basinger MA, Gale GR, Smith AB.

Author information:

Syntheses and relative cadmium mobilizing properties are described for three new 
monoaralkyl esters (HOOCCH(SH)CH(SH)COOR, where R = phenylethyl ((CH2)2C6H5),
MPhEDMS; R = 3-phenylpropyl ((CH2)3C6H5), MPhPDMS; and R = 2-phenoxyethyl
((CH2)2OC6H5). MPhOEDMS) of meso-2,3-dimercaptusuccinic acid. These were prepared
by the reaction of the corresponding alcohol with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) in aqueous HCl. When administered intraperitoneally to cadmium-loaded
mice at 0.50 mmol/kg/day for four consecutive days, all induced significant
reductions in the whole body cadmium levels. MPhEDMS, 60%; MPhPDMS, 66%; and
MPhOEDMS, 58% in comparison with control levels. At the same dosage monoisoamyl
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (Mi-ADMS) and a dithiocarbamate, sodium
N-benzyl-4-O-(beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-D-glucamine-N-carbodithioate++ + (BLDTC)
induced reductions of 65% and 57%, respectively. Hepatic and renal cadmium were
also depleted significantly, while brain cadmium levels were unchanged. These
compounds induced a significant reduction in the cadmium levels of the spleen,
and one, MPhOEDMS, produced a 10% decrease in pancreatic cadmium. The manner in
which the later injections removed smaller fractions of the total body cadmium is
consistent with a bodily distribution of these compounds by which they are
concentrated primarily in the kidneys and the liver, with much smaller amounts
reaching other organs. It is proposed that these compounds enter renal and
hepatic cells through an anion transport system.

Measurement of the extravascular concentration of renal agents following
intravenous bolus injection.

Peters AM(1), Brown H, Cosgriff P.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.

The extravascular concentration (Ce) of some renal agents, in relation to the
simultaneous plasma concentration (Ci), was calculated as a function of time
after intravenous injection. Four agents were studied: 51Cr-ethylenediamine
tetraacetate (EDTA) (n = 11), 125I-hippuran (n = 11), 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) (n = 11) and 99Tcm-mercaptoacetyl triglycine MAG3 (n = 20). Plasma
clearance curves were constructed from data acquired from multiple blood sampling
and fitted with two exponentials. The extravascular content of tracer at any time
is equal to the injected dose remaining after subtraction of the intravascular
tracer content and the total amount of tracer cleared from plasma. Mean Ce/Ci at 
equilibrium (defined as the time, > 120 min, when Ce/Ci reaches its maximum
value) was 1.087 (S.D. 0.019) for EDTA, 1.73 (0.48) for hippuran, 0.37 (0.2) for 
DMSA and 0.64 (0.3) for MAG3. Corresponding clearance (F) values were 68 (13),
415 (149), 15.6 (9.5) and 214 (52) ml min-1 1.73 m-2. Ce/Ci correlated with F and
was also related to protein binding in plasma. Extrapolation of the regressions
of Ce/Ci on F to F = 0 at several time points after injection gives a curve of
Ce/Ci (at F = 0) against time which represents the rate of equilibration of the
tracer throughout its distribution volume that would be seen with zero clearance,
and therefore allows measurement of the in vivo protein binding of the tracer in 
plasma. Protein binding was zero for EDTA, 30% for hippuran, 86% for DMSA and 88%
for MAG3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

An extensive study to compare planar and single photon emission computed
tomographic (SPECT) 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) determination of
differential kidney function (DKF) has been carried out. The study has
demonstrated that it is possible to use SPECT differential kidney function in
place of that obtained using planar scintigraphy. The SPECT DKF value correlated 
with the planar DKF value. Gradient shaded three-dimensional surface images,
reoriented transaxial, sagittal and coronal slices were produced during the same

Kidney volume estimation using 99Tcm-DMSA RSPECT: evaluation by phantom study.

Author information: 
(1)Nuclear Medicine Department, Dubai Hospital, DOH&MS, United Arab Emirates.

Renal parenchymal volume is important for clinical interpretation. The phantom
study was carried out to validate the volume calculation. The volume of kidney
phantom was determined using reoriented single photon emission computed
tomography (RSPECT). The phantom volume range was 20-300 ml. There are two major 
factors in the determination of volume which are radioactivity concentration and 
organ/background ratio. Our results showed that the effect of radioactivity
concentration on the volume in the kidney phantom is -3.3 to 7.5% whereas the
effect of organ/background ration was only 2.2%. Our relative volume deviation,
therefore, from the real volume was 1.43%. We concluded that it is feasible to
use kidney volume in clinical work.

Comment in
    Arch Dis Child. 1994 Oct;71(4):386-7.

Seventy six children, 18 boys and 58 girls, aged 0-15.9 (median 1.0) years, with 
acute pyelonephritis were prospectively studied with a technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan during infection and two months later. Fifty 
nine of these children were also studied two years after the infection. Seventeen
children with a normal DMSA scan during infection or at two months after
infection, or both, were not investigated by a DMSA scan at two years after acute
pyelonephritis. A micturition cystourethrogram was performed in all the children 
after two months. Changes on the DMSA scan were found in 65 (86%) children during
acute pyelonephritis, in 45 (59%) children at two months, and in 28 (37%)
children at two years after infection. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was found in
19 (25%) children at two months. Renal scarring was significantly correlated with
the presence of gross VUR and recurrent pyelonephritis, but 62% of the scarred
kidneys were drained by non-refluxing ureters. Children with scars were older at 
the time of acute pyelonephritis than those without scars but no difference was
found between the groups with regard to duration of illness, levels of C reactive
protein and maximum white cell count, glomerular filtration rate, nor renal
concentration capacity at the time of infection. It is concluded that renal
scarring after acute pyelonephritis in children is more common than has been
previously thought. Although children with gross VUR and recurrent pyelonephritis
are at the greatest risk, renal scarring is more often seen without these risk
factors.

The newly developed 99mTc-labeled renal imaging agent, mercaptoacetyltriglycine
(MAG3), is a tubular secreted compound. It is expected the most suitable agent to
measure renal function and image urinary tract because of the excellent imaging
properties and availability of 99mTc and preferred biological qualities of
radiohippurates. We examined 15 patients (8 males, 7 females, mean age 55 years
old) with renal and urinary tract disease. After drinking 400 ml of water, 185,
370 or 555 MBq of 99mTc-MAG3 was injected with the supine position. Dynamic scans
were acquired for 20 minutes on a large field of view gamma camera (ZLC-7500
Siemens Medical Inc.) linked to a computer system (Scintipac-2400 Shimadzu Co.)
in a 64 x 64 matrix. Regions of interest (ROI) were placed around each kidney.
Curves of 12 seconds frame rate were generated from all two ROIs over the 20
minutes study. The time to peak count (Tmax) and time from peak count to a half
count (T1/2) were calculated from the curve data. 99mTc-DTPA renal imaging was
examined to the same patients with the same method like 99mTc-MAG3. The renogram 
of 131I-orthoiodohippurate (OIH) was performed with probe method. The excellent
quality of the renal image was obtained with 185-555 MBq of 99mTc-MAG3 compared
with the same dose of 99mTc-DTPA respectively. The diagnostic value of 99mTc-MAG3
renal imaging was as well as 99mTc-DMSA renal imaging. The Tmax of 99mTc-MAG3
renogram was same value of that of both 99mTc-DTPA and 131I-OIH renogram. The
T1/2 of 99mTc-MAG3 renogram was significantly lower than that of 99mTc-DTPA
renogram. The T1/2 of 99mTc-MAG3 renogram was slightly higher that of 131I-OIH
renogram. We conclude that the renal imaging of 99mTc-MAG3 was able to acquire
the most excellent image and the proper renogram pattern as same as 131I-OIH
renogram.

Poor renal uptake of technetium-99m-DMSA and technetium-99m-MDP in a patient with
Fanconi syndrome and near normal glomerular filtration rate.

Kim SE(1), Cho JT, Lee DS, Chung JK, Kim S, Lee MC, Lee JS, Koh CS.

University College of Medicine, Korea.

We present a patient with Fanconi syndrome who demonstrated poor renal uptake of 
99mTc-DMSA and high urinary concentration of the tracer. A 99mTc-DTPA scan was
normal and the creatinine clearance only minimally decreased. These findings
suggest that 99mTc-DMSA may be accumulated in the kidney by glomerular filtration
and subsequent tubular reabsorption, with the nonabsorbed fraction appearing in
the urine. In Fanconi Syndrome the tubular reabsorption of DMSA may also be
reduced, thus explaining the poor renal uptake in this patient. A 99mTc-MDP bone 
scan showed faint renal uptake and diffuse high uptake mainly in the spine,
demonstrating that the metabolic bone disease associated with Fanconi Syndrome
can be another mechanism for poor renal visualization on bone scan.

Lead may be an industrial and an environmental hazard which becomes of greater
importance every year. Classical symptoms of plumbism are rare, whenever minor
clinical signs increase in frequency. Erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin and
delta-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase are reliable indicators of the importance 
of the lead poisoning in individuals. The concentration of lead in blood is also 
a suitable biological indicator as is EDTA mobilization test. The treatment is
based on the use of chelating agents such as calcium EDTA or DMSA, but the only
solution is reduction or removal of the sources of lead exposure.

PURPOSE: To assess the potential of technetium-99m (V) dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scintigraphy for diagnosis of soft-tissue tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tc-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy was performed in 76 patients 
with histologic proof of soft-tissue tumors. In 57 of these patients, gallium-67 
citrate scintigraphy was performed within 2 weeks after Tc-99m (V) DMSA
scintigraphy.
RESULTS: Uptake of Tc-99m (V) DMSA was clearly detected in almost all sarcomas,
metastatic carcinomas, highly recurrent benign tumors (ie, extra-abdominal
desmoids and tenosynovial giant cell tumors), superficial and deep hemangiomas,
and granulomatous soft-tissue lesions but was not found in other benign solid
tumors of soft tissue. Uptake of Ga-67 citrate was clearly detected in all
inflammatory lesions and metastatic carcinomas, eight of 14 sarcomas (57%), and
two of 10 highly recurrent benign tumors (20%) but was not found in hemangiomas
or benign soft-tissue tumors.
CONCLUSION: Low-grade malignant and highly recurrent benign lesions, which often 
recur after surgery, were detected more accurately with Tc-99m (V) DMSA
scintigraphy than with Ga-67 citrate scintigraphy.

Captopril-enhanced renal scintigraphy with Tc-99m DMSA was performed in an
11-year-old boy with hypertension. This showed a significant reduction in
function of the right kidney. Renal arteriography was performed and showed two
renal arteries on the right, the major one with stenosis. This case illustrates
the possible role that scintigraphy with Tc-99m DMSA can play in the diagnosis of
renovascular hypertension.

A 7-year-old girl was hospitalized with urinary incontinence. Intravenous
pyelography showed the dilatation of upper segment of the right kidney, in which 
slight radioisotopic accumulation was detected on renal scintigraphy with
99mTc-DMSA. On computerized tomographic (CT) scan, a cystic mass shadow occupied 
the retroperitoneal space. During surgery, the right kidney was found to be
completely duplicated and the ectopic ureter opened in Vestibule vaginae
accompanied with midureteral stricture. The ectopic ureter was incised above the 
strictural site and anastomosed with the ureter of the lower segment. Although
approximately 700 cases of ectopic ureter have been reported in Japan, congenital
midureteral stricture accompanying ectopic ureter is extremely rare.

We describe a simple method of pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid
[99mTc(V)-DMSA] preparation for the imaging of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid
using commercially available kits. 99mTc(V)-DMSA is available at high pH
(approximately 7.5) by adding NaHCO3 solution in the presence of a small amount
of reducing agent (SnCl2). On the other hand, trivalent 99mTc-DMSA
[99mTc(III)-DMSA] can be obtained at low pH (below 3) in the presence of an
excess amount of reducing agent. In the clinical evaluation of a patient with a
medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, only 99mTc(V)-DMSA revealed an area of
intense accumulation.

Estimation of normal chromium-51 ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid clearance in 
children.

In order to estimate the normal range of chromium-51 ethylene diamine
tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) clearance in children, we selected a series of 256
patients with past or present urinary tract infection who showed, at the time of 
the clearance determination, normal technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy and normal left to right DMSA relative uptake. The clearance was
calculated by means of either the simplified second exponential method or the
120-min single blood sample; Chantler's correction was used in order to correct
for having neglected the first exponential. There was a progressive increase in
clearance from the first weeks of life (mean value around 1 month: 55 ml/min/1.73
m2), with a plateau at around 18 months. Between 2 and 17 years of age, the
clearance values remained constant, with a mean value of 114 ml/min/1.73 m2 (SD: 
24 ml/min); this is similar to the level described for inulin clearance. No
significant differences were observed between boys and girls, or between
clearance values calculated with one or with two blood samples. Taking into
account the hour of intravenous injection of the tracer, we did not observe any
influence of the lunchtime meal on the distribution of the 51Cr-EDTA clearance
values.

Lead poisoning is an unusual complication of gunshot wounds that occurs when
retained lead bullet fragments are in contact with body fluids capable of
solubilizing lead. The epidemic of violence by gunfire may result in increasing
numbers of lead poisoning cases from this exposure. The use of oral chelation for
toxicity resulting from this mode of exposure has not been previously discussed. 
Cases of lead poisoning arising from bullet lead in the synovial cavity of the
hip, synovial cavity of the chest, and pleural space are reported. A combination 
of surgical debridement and chelation therapy with oral succimer produced a
satisfactory outcome in all three cases. Oral succimer may be a safe and
effective chelation agent for treating lead toxicity in adults with high lead
levels secondary to gun shot wounds.

The value of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) planar renal scintigraphy, DMSA
single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) in the assessment of renal injury related to vesicoureteral reflux 
(VUR) was examined in 60 kidneys of 32 pediatric patients (28 bilateral, 4
unilateral) with primary VUR. The results were: (1) detection of minor renal
lesions was best with MRI, then DMSA-planar and DMSA-SPECT, and (2) in comparing 
the positive rate, DMSA-SPECT (85%) and MRI (83.3%) were superior to intravenous 
pyelography (55%) and DMSA-planar scintigraphy (65%). These results suggest that 
DMSA-SPECT or MRI may be more sensitive than DMSA-planar scintigraphy and
intravenous pyelography in detecting renal injury related to VUR in pediatric
patients.

A lead poisoned adult (blood lead level 384 micrograms/dL) had a specific urinary
porphyrin profile of elevated porphyrins including coproporphyrin III and
5-carboxylic acid derivatives. A multilinear gradient elution, modified with an
ion-pair and a reversed phase column were employed for the separation of the
diagnostically important porphyrin isomers. Fluorescence detection enhanced both 
sensitivity and selectivity. Both compounds were restored to normal levels
following two courses of meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid: 90 mg/kg/d x 5 d at
one month intervals. The decrease of clinical symptoms was associated with
increase of delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase from 53 to 230 U/mL blood and
hemoglobin from 8.4 to 12.7 g/dL. Blood lead decreased from 384 to 24
micrograms/dL, urine lead from 1286 to 188 micrograms/L and urine coproporphyrin 
III from 5712 to 25 micrograms/L.

Clinical value of DMSA planar and single photon emission computed tomography as
an initial diagnostic tool in adult women with recurrent acute pyelonephritis.

Seoul, Korea.

Routine DMSA scintigraphy, ultrasound (US) of the kidney, intravenous pyelography
(IVP) and voiding cystoureterography (VCU) were performed in 27 consecutive adult
women with recurrent acute pyelonephritis (APN) during a 12-month follow-up. Both
planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were
obtained for DMSA scan. DMSA scans were repeated in those patients with abnormal 
initial scan. DMSA-SPECT showed normal findings in 2, single renal cortical
detect (RCD) in 9 and multiple RCD in 16 (including nonvisualization in 2). Of
the 11 kidneys with normal findings or single RCD on DMSA-SPECT, only 1 (9%)
showed vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on VCU (grade I). A large proportion of those 
with multiple RCDs showed abnormal findings on IVP (44%, 7/16), US (38%, 6/16) or
VCU (31%, 5/16); 63% in any of these three studies. 5 of 6 patients with VUR had 
multiple RCDs on DMSA-SPECT, and 3 of these 5 showed no abnormality on IVP or US.
7 patients who needed other managements besides initial standard antibiotic
treatment had multiple RCDs on DMSA-SPECT. 15 normal women were also studied and 
showed normal DMSA-SPECT, US and IVP, in all cases. Follow-up DMSA-SPECT was done
in 16 patients (7 with single RCD, 9 with multiple RCD). All 7 patients with
single RCD showed improvement, in those with multiple RCDs improvement was
observed in 2, no change in 7 on follow-up studies. We conclude: (1) DMSA-SPECT
is a useful initial diagnostic tool in adult women with recurrent APN to identify
patients who need more extensive radiological studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

Urine interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in children with acute pyelonephritis, in
relation to DMSA scintigraphy in the acute phase and at 1-year follow-up.

The relationship between urine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8
(IL-8)/creatinine quotients and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy, performed within 10 days of acute first-time pyelonephritis and
after 1 year, was studied in 41 children. The urine IL-6 and IL-8/creatinine
quotients were also related to the urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG)
and albumin/creatinine quotients. Presence of DMSA uptake defects, reflecting
local inflammation, in children in the acute phase of pyelonephritis, were
associated with elevated urine IL-6/creatinine quotients (median 27 pg/mumol); in
children without DMSA changes there was no increase in quotients (median
non-detectable) (P < 0.05). Persistent DMSA changes at the 1-year follow-up,
probably reflecting renal scarring, were only seen in children with increased
urine IL-6/creatinine quotients in the acute phase (P < 0.01). No correlation was
found between urine IL-8 and DMSA uptake defects. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) at 
6-8 weeks did not correlate with the urine cytokine levels in the acute phase.
The urine excretion of NAG and albumin, reflecting renal dysfunction, was
associated with values of both urine IL-6 and IL-8/creatinine quotients, but not 
with DMSA defects or VUR. Thus, the initial urine IL-6/creatinine quotients might
be used as an indicator of risk for persistent renal damage in acute
pyelonephritis.

99mTc-DMSA imaging with tomography in renal transplant recipients with abnormal
lower urinary tracts.

This study examined whether renal parenchymal imaging using 99mTc DMSA
scintigraphy with tomography is a sensitive measure of renal scarring in renal
transplant recipients with an abnormal lower urinary tract and whether such scars
correlate with impairment of renal function. Three groups of patients were
compared: group 1, patients with an abnormal lower urinary tract and
deteriorating renal function (n = 9); group 2, abnormal lower urinary tract and
stable renal function (n = 5); and group 3, normal lower urinary tract and
deteriorating renal function (n = 8). Eight of the nine patients in group 1 had
multiple scars visible on 99mTc DMSA scans and this correlated with histology
when a renal biopsy was performed; the only patient without scars had a
transplant glomerulopathy. The presence of scars was associated with either
raised intravesical pressures or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Only 
one patient in each of groups 2 and 3 had visible scars and both these patients
had a history of recurrent UTIs. Patients in group 3 with deteriorating renal
function due to chronic rejection documented by biopsy did not have cortical
scars visible with 99mTc DMSA tomography. 99mTc DMSA scanning with tomography is 
a useful investigation in the management of renal transplant patients with
declining renal function; multiple scars may indicate abnormal lower urinary
tract function and are not seen in chronic rejection.

The effect of various antidotes on the excretion of arsenic into the feces in
vivo and on the biliary and enteric excretion in situ was investigated on
segments of jejunum and colon in anesthetized guinea-pigs using the pendular
perfusion technique, according to Henning and Forth (1982). In the in situ
experiments guinea-pigs received As2O3 (0.02 mmol As(III)/kg) and 30 min later,
British-Anti-Lewisite (BAL), dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS),
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or 2,3-bis-(acetylthio)propanesulfonamide (BAPSA) 
(0.1 or 0.7 mmol/kg each) into the jugular vein. In the in vivo experiments
guinea-pigs received As2O3 s.c. (same dose as above) and 30 min later the same
antidotes (0.1 mmol/kg i.p.). The feces were collected for 24 h and the arsenic
content measured. During the 60-min perfusion period the amount of arsenic
excreted into the jejunum or colon was only 3% or 0.4% of the dose administered, 
respectively. Of the arsenic dose, 8% was found in the bile. None of the
antidotes had an effect on the arsenic excretion into the jejunum or colon. No
change in biliary excretion was found in animals treated with BAL, 0.1 or 0.7
mmol/kg, respectively. DMSA, BAPSA or DMPS, 0.1 mmol/kg, increased the biliary
excretion of arsenic to 14, 33, or 43% of the dose administered and after 0.7
mmol/kg to 29, 37, or 42%, respectively. Furthermore, a significant increase (P >
0.05) was found for the bile/blood concentration ratio in the following order:
control < BAL < DMSA < BAPSA approximately DMPS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Dimercaptosuccinic acid in the treatment of depression following lead exposure.

Frumkin H(1), Gerr F.

(1)Division of Environmental and Occupational Health, Emory University School of 
Public Health, Atlanta, GA 30329.

Long-term exposure to lead is known to cause a variety of neurotoxic
manifestations, including symptoms of depression. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),
a recently approved oral chelating agent, can diminish the body burden of lead,
but few cases of documented clinical improvement following treatment have been
reported. We report a case of moderate to severe depression in a long-term lead
worker that appeared to respond dramatically to DMSA. This response suggests a
possible therapeutic role for DMSA in the treatment of depression in lead-exposed
patients.

Determination and metabolism of dithiol chelating agents. XV. The
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid-cysteine (1:2) mixed disulfide, a major urinary

rat.

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in humans is an effective p.o.
therapeutically useful chelating agent of Pb. In humans given DMSA p.o., the
major urinary metabolite is DMSA-cysteine (1:2) mixed disulfide. In order to
determine its efficacy in mobilizing Pb and increasing urinary Pb excretion, the 
mixed disulfide was given to rats treated previously with Pb acetate. The mixed
disulfide was as effective as DMSA in increasing the urinary excretion of Pb and 
mobilizing Pb from the kidney. DMSA, however, appears to be superior for
mobilizing Pb from the liver and the brain. After the mixed disulfide was given
s.c. to rats, DMSA was found in the blood and urine. Twenty-four hours after
administration, 0.7% of the administered mixed disulfide was found in the urine
as DMSA, indicating the mixed disulfide can be reduced to DMSA. The mixed
disulfide was also reduced in vitro to DMSA during incubation with rat blood.
Although in the rat the DMSA-cysteine (1:2) mixed disulfide mobilized Pb from the
kidney, increased the urinary excretion of Pb and was to some extent reduced to
DMSA, its fate and pharmacological properties in the human, where it is found
after DMSA administration, are unknown.

Preoperative localization of occult medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland with
single-photon emission tomography dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Udelsman R(1), Ball D, Baylin SB, Wong CY, Osterman FA Jr, Sostre S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Md. 21287-5674.

BACKGROUND: Patients who undergo thyroidectomy for medullary carcinoma of the
thyroid gland (MTC) often have elevations of postoperative serum calcitonin
levels, which are indicative of metastatic or residual disease. It has been
extremely difficult to localize tumor in these patients with standard diagnostic 
studies such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance
imaging scans. Previous studies have suggested that planar technetium 99m (V)
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphic scans can localize MTC in these
patients. We have recently increased the sensitivity of planar scintigraphic
images by using single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). This study was
performed to compare the sensitivity of planar DMSA scans with that of SPECT DMSA
scans.
METHODS: Two normal volunteers and three patients with occult MTC after previous 
total thyroidectomy underwent planar and SPECT DMSA scans. Each patient
subsequently underwent surgical exploration based on the DMSA scans.
RESULTS: Physiologic DMSA uptake was noted in the nasopharynx, axial skeleton,
breast, liver, spleen, heart, kidneys, urinary bladder, great vessels, and
skeletal muscles in both normal volunteers and patients with occult MTC. Planar
DMSA scans and dynamic computed tomographic scans failed to localize MTC in any
of these patients who had minimal disease. SPECT DMSA scans correctly localized
cervical MTC in two of three patients, as proved by subsequent surgical
resection. One patient who had a negative cervical exploration is presumed to
have had a false-positive SPECT DMSA scan.
CONCLUSIONS: SPECT DMSA scans appear to be a sensitive, safe, and noninvasive
localization technique for patients with occult MTC who have undergone previous
thyroidectomy.

Comparison by SPECT of renal scars after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy
and percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

Lechevallier E(1), Siles S, Ortega JC, Coulange C.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Timone's Hospital, Marseille, France.

Some renal calculi are borderline indications for either extracorporeal shock
wave lithotripsy (ESWL) or percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Our purpose was
to quantify by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) the parenchymal
lesions of these two procedures to make the choice easier. The SPECT study was
done before and 30 days after the stone treatment. The scan was carried out 10
hours after injection of 99mTc-DMSA using a GE400 rotative gamma camera, which
data were reconstructed in three planes. The local uptake and scar of the treated
area were evaluated in 22 patients with symptomatic kidney stones without
previous treatment or renal failure. Twelve patients (mean stone size 12 x 9 mm) 
were treated on a piezoelectric (EDAP LT-01) lithotripter (mean shock wave number
3420), and ten patients (mean stone size 24 x 17 mm) were treated by PCNL (32F
Amplatz sheath in a lower calix). There were no complications, and the stone-free
rate at day 30 was 50% in both groups. In the ESWL group, all of the kidneys
demonstrated a loss of local uptake, whereas 7 of the 10 in the PCNL group did
so. In the ESWL group, 4 of the 12 kidneys had a local loss exceeding 4% but only
2 of 10 kidneys in the PCNL group. There were 7 scars in the treated area in the 
ESWL group and 6 in the PCNL group. Extracorporeal lithotripsy does not seem to
be a nontraumatic procedure for the kidney. For stones that would require several
sessions of ESWL, the use of PCNL must be preferred.

[Lead poisoning following administration of "home specialties"].

[Article in German]

Voack C(1), Kayasseh L, Galeazzi RL.

Author information: 
(1)Medizinische Klinik A, Kantonsspital St. Gallen.

Three cases of lead intoxication after the administration of "house specialties" 
are illustrated. The lead source could be traced to a lead-containing ointment in
all three patients. Two of them suffered lead intoxication as a result of topical
application to the lips, while the third had ingested the ointment orally.
Clinical signs, diagnosis and therapy of lead poisoning are described in the
light of the case reports. The patients were treated with various drugs
(N-acetylcysteine and the complex chelators D-penicillamine and
2.3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (2.3-DMSA). The therapeutic effects were determined
on specific laboratory features in blood and urine. N-acetylcysteine was not
absolutely confirming in our case. D-penicillamine was effective, but only after 
removal of the source of exposure. Because of its known adverse drug reactions,
we preferred the oral lead chelator 2.3-DMSA. Treatment with DMSA resulted in a
considerable decrease in the blood lead concentration and in increase in urinary 
lead output. The urinary excretion of aminolevulinic acid and coproporphyrin
normalized under DMSA. The treatment was well tolerated and no appreciable side
effects were noticed. The literature on metabolism and the characteristic effects
of lead intoxication is reviewed and the production, qualities and administration
of emplastrum plumbi are described. All three lead-containing ointments are
summarized by the characterizing term "house specialties". One wonders whether it
is justified that there is still control and registration of such "house
specialties" in Switzerland.

Increased bone marrow uptake on Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy in a patient with renal 
osteodystrophy.

Caglar M(1), Naldöken S.

Author information: 
(1)Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Nuclear Medicine,

A 16-year-old male patient was evaluated with Tc-99m
Diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA) and Tc-99m 2-3 Dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scintigraphy for renal failure secondary to renal calculi. The uptake in
the renal cortex was significantly decreased both on DMSA and DTPA studies.
Uptake calculation on DMSA scintigraphy in the kidneys disclosed values of less
than 5%. The activity in the liver and bone was significantly increased. A bone
scan performed with Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) revealed increased bone 
uptake with decreased soft tissue activity. Findings on bone scan were compatible
with super scan, most likely due to renal osteodystrophy. This case illustrates
the altered biodistribution of Tc-99m DMSA and a shift of the radiopharmaceutical
to the bone marrow which is not likely related to colloid formation due to
changes in mineral balance in patients with renal failure.

All areas of radiology are constantly evolving. At times rapid advances are made

is gradual as established procedures and techniques are refined. The following
review of selected areas in nuclear medicine includes both dramatic changes due
to new developments and evolutionary changes in established techniques. The first
section reviews the development of monoclonal antibodies for use in
radioscintigraphy of neoplastic disease. Although many articles have been written
about this topic over the years, the clinical applications have suddenly expanded
because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved one monoclonal
antibody for use in the imaging of colorectal and ovarian cancer. It is
anticipated that a number of other antibodies will be approved for clinical
scintigraphy of both malignant and benign disease and immunotherapy. It is
advised that the radiologist performing nuclear medicine procedures become
knowledgeable about this expanding area of clinical application. The second
section reviews several new radiopharmaceuticals that are being used with
increasing frequency for myocardial imaging. The behavior of these tracers is
different from that of thallium, and specialized imaging techniques are required.
Although the clinical value of these agents is still questioned by some, they are
widely used. Familiarity with this topic is recommended. The last section reviews
some of the radiopharmaceuticals available for renal imaging and functional
evaluation. The relatively new technetium-labeled pharmaceutical that
approximates the behavior of hippuran is emphasized. New applications with the
renal cortical imaging agent technetium DMSA are also reviewed. A thorough
knowledge of the biologic behavior of these tracers and appropriate imaging and
measurement techniques is extremely important for their appropriate clinical use.

Nomograms of renal length in children obtained from DMSA scintigraphy.

Sisayan RM(1), Rossleigh MA, Mackey DW.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia.

The aim of this study was to establish nomograms of renal length in children
comparing age, body weight, and height. Renal lengths were obtained from data
derived from Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy in 266 patients with 532 kidneys that
appeared normal on DMSA studies. The children's ages ranged from 6 days to 19
years. Renal length appeared to have nonlinear relationships with patient weight 
and age, but was found to correlate linearly with patient height. On average,
scintigraphic renal length exceeded sonographic renal length by approximately 1
cm. The most likely explanation for this is the effect of respiration causing
renal motion during the acquisition of the scintigraphic images. It is hoped that
the nomograms derived from these data will be of use in routine clinical practice
for nuclear medicine departments performing DMSA scintigraphy in children.

Influence of 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on the renal disposition of mercury in
normal and uninephrectomized rats exposed to inorganic mercury.

The effects of the water-soluble chelating agents 2,3-dimercapto-1-propane
sulfonate (DMPS) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on the renal
disposition of inorganic mercury were studied in normal and uninephrectomized
(NPX) rats injected (i.v.) with a nontoxic 0.5-mumol/kg dose of mercuric chloride
(HgCl2). When a 100-mg/kg dose of either DMPS or DMSA was injected (i.p.) 24 and 
30 hr after treatment with HgCl2, the renal concentration and burden of inorganic
mercury decreased markedly in both normal and NPX rats during the 24 hr after the
first dose of the respective chelating agent was administered. Treatment with
DMPS was more effective than treatment with DMSA in reducing the renal burden of 
mercury in both groups of rats. The fall in the renal concentration and burden of
mercury in both normal and NPX rats was due primarily to a decrease in the
content of mercury in the renal cortex and outer stripe of the outer medulla.
However, the decrease in the concentration of inorganic mercury in the outer
stripe was significantly greater in NPX rats than in normal rats. Both chelating 
agents caused urinary excretion of mercury to increase significantly in normal
and NPX rats. In association with the increased renal release of mercury in NPX
rats, the urinary excretion of mercury per gram of kidney was significantly
greater in NPX rats than in normal rats. These data indicate that the renal
handling of DMPS and DMSA may be altered significantly after a substantial
reduction in renal mass. Findings from the present study also show that treatment
with DMPS, but not with DMSA, causes the content of mercury in the liver and
cellular fraction of blood to decrease in normal and NPX rats. These findings
indicate that there are significant differences in the extrarenal handling of
these two chelating agents. The findings in the present study suggest that DMPS
and DMSA are very effective agents in reducing the renal (and whole body) burden 
of inorganic mercury in normal and NPX rats.

Technetium-99m(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 67Ga-citrate scintigraphy
were performed in three patients with primary and recurrent tenosynovial
giant-cell tumor (one localized type and two diffuse type). In all cases,
99mTc(V)DMSA showed marked accumulation in all primary and recurrent tumors;
however, 67Ga-citrate showed no accumulation in any of the tumors.
Technetium-99m(V)-DMSA scintigraphy was useful in detecting tenosynovial
giant-cell tumor and in diagnosing recurrence of this tumor.

Superiority of Mi-ADMS to DMSA as parenteral treatment for decreasing mercury
(203Hg) body burden in rats.

The efficiency of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and the monoisoamyl
ester of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (Mi-ADMS) in decreasing 203Hg retention
was evaluated in rats in relation to age and time of treatment. The experiments
were performed on six-week- and seven-day-old Wistar rats, which received 203Hg
by intraperitoneal administration. The chelators DMSA or Mi-ADMS were also
administered intraperitoneally, twice, on two consecutive days, in doses of 0.25 
mmol/kg body weight as early (0.5 and 24 h) or delayed treatment (24 and 48 h, or
48 and 72 h) after 203Hg administration. The retention of 203Hg was determined in
the carcass, liver, kidneys and brain six days after administration using gamma
scintillation counters (double crystal, well type). In all experimental
conditions, regardless of the animals' age and time of chelation therapy, Mi-ADMS
was found to be superior to DMSA in reducing the body burden of 203Hg in whole
body and organs. Mi-ADMS therefore seems to be a very promising chelator in the
treatment of mercury poisoning.

Transfer of arsenite from glutathione to dithiols: a model of interaction.

Delnomdedieu M(1), Basti MM, Otvos JD, Thomas DJ.

(1)Center for Environmental Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill
27599-7310.

The interactions of arsenate and arsenite with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) have been characterized using carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance. These 
studies show that DMSA reduces arsenate to arsenite and complexes arsenite.
Monitoring the carbon-13 signals of complexed DMSA and liberated glutathione
shows that DMSA readily extracts arsenite from a (glutathione)3-arsenite complex,
proving the affinity of arsenite for dithiols is greater than that for
monothiols. Competition between DMSA (vicinal thiols) and dithioerythritol
(1,4-dimercapto-2,3-butanediol) for binding of arsenite indicates that the
binding affinity is inversely related to the distance between the two thiol
groups. On the basis of these findings, a model for the interaction of arsenic
with mono- and dithiol-containing molecules is proposed.

Decreasing 203Hg retention by intraperitoneal treatment with monoalkyl esters of 
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in rats.

The effect of nine monoalkyl esters of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on
203Hg retention after a single i.p. dose was evaluated in 6-7 week-old female
albino rats. The monoesters were the monomethyl (MMDMS), monoethyl (MEDMS),
mono-n-propyl (Mn-PDMS), monoisopropyl (Mi-PDMS), mono-n-butyl (Mn-BDMS),
monoisobutyl (Mi-BDMS), mono-n-amyl (Mn-ADMS), monoisoamyl (Mi-ADMS) and
mono-n-hexyl (Mn-HDMS). Dimercaptosuccinic acid or one of the monoesters were
administered at a dose of 0.25 mmol kg-1 body wt. twice, i.e. 30 min and 24 h
after 203Hg administration. The whole body (WB) radioactivity was determined on
the 2nd, 4th and 6th days. The radioactivity in the carcass (C) (whole body
without the gastrointestinal tract), liver (L), both kidneys (K) and brain (B)
was determined 6 days after 203Hg administration. All treated animals had a
significantly lower body burden of mercury than the controls. The reduction of
203Hg retention in WB and other body compartments was higher in animals treated
with monoesters than in rats treated with DMSA. The relative effectiveness of the
monoesters was dependent on the nature of the alkyl groups, the efficiency being 
higher in higher analogues. Maximum activity was attained with the C5 (Mn-ADMS,
Mi-ADMS) and C6 (Mn-HDMS) esters. These chelators reduced WB, C, L, K and B
mercury retention by 90, 89, 76, 93 and 80%, respectively. Iso derivatives were
more efficient than the normal isomers (Mi-PDMS > Mn-PDMS; Mi-BDMS > Mn-BDMS;
Mi-ADMS > Mn-ADMS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The value of performing both IVU and DMSA scan in patients with urinary stone
disease.

(1)Section of Urology, Jordan University Hospital, Amman.

A study of 60 patients with stone disease was done, all patients had an IVU and
DMSA scan. A DMSA scan helps to show clear cortical images, diagnose cortical
scars and absence of cortical tissue. While the IVU allows gross evaluation of
kidney function and morphological changes, the DMSA scan is an accurate measure
of functioning renal mass. Anyhow, both studies are complementary to each other
in patients with stones disease.

[Multiple myeloma presenting with amyloid arthropathy].

[Article in Japanese]

(1)Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University.

Amyloid arthropathy rarely occurs in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) or
primary amyloidosis (PA). Amyloid infiltration in and about the joints may be so 
extensive as to simulate the findings of rheumatoid arthritis. Some cases have
been reported in which the articular manifestations were present for many months 
prior to the diagnosis of amyloid arthropathy. The delay of the diagnosis can
result in the development of a fatal complication of MM or PA, which is not
always unavoidable. We have encountered an unusual case of MM which the articular
manifestations were present prior to the diagnosis of MM. A 59-year-old woman had
a four-month history of hypesthesia in the median-nerve distribution of both
hands and polyarthralgia. Far advanced renal insufficiency was evident, but its
etiology was not determined. The patient was maintained on hemodialysis. The
shoulders, wrists, hips and finger joints were symmetrically involved with
articular swelling. All of these joints showed the avid uptake of Tc-99m (V)
DMSA. The serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis demonstrated the presence of
IgG-lambda type M-component and lambda type Bence Jones proteins, respectively.
The bone marrow findings and bone roentgenograms supported the diagnosis of MM.
Biopsy specimens from the synovial membrane revealed amyloid deposition. Her
condition was much improved with melphalan and prednisolone.

Hypertension in paediatrics: can pre- and post-captopril technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans exclude renovascular disease?

Minty I(1), Lythgoe MF, Gordon I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Hospital for Sick Children, London, UK.

In children over 1 year of age, renal disease is the commonest cause of
hypertension. Arteriography is considered the reference method to establish the
diagnosis of renovascular disease; however, it is an invasive technique with a
high radiation burden for children. This was a retrospective study of pre- and
post-capto-technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) imaging compared with
arteriography in 18 children between the ages of 3 and 17 years. Alone, the
99mTc-DMSA scan is a sensitive indicator of renal parenchymal disease, although
non-specific in suggesting the pathology. The combination of pre- and
post-captopril studies may increase the sensitivity and specificity in the
diagnosis of renovascular disease in the presence of hypertension. This work
suggests that a screening investigation with a low radiation burden can be
carried out at most institutions; if the investigation is positive, there will be
a high index of suspicion that renovascular disease is the cause of the
hypertension.

The 10-year survival rate for medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MCT) is 50%;
thus, good tumor-seeking radiopharmaceuticals are needed to localize foci of
recurrence and metastasis during follow-up. Two patients with metastatic MCT were
studied with Tl-201, I-131 MIBG, Tc-99m (V)-DMSA, and Tc-99m MIBI. A SPECT study 
with the latter agent allowed the visualization and precise localization of a
metastatic mediastinal lymph node. More studies need to be done to evaluate the
role of Tc-99m MIBI in the detection of recurrence and metastases of MCT.

The current role of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in the management of
childhood lead poisoning.

Glotzer DE(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Boston City Hospital/Boston University School of
Medicine, Massachusetts.

2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is an orally active chelating agent used in
the treatment of lead and other heavy metal poisonings. In animals, DMSA chelates
lead from soft tissues, including the brain, without clinically evident adverse
effects or histopathological changes. In lead-poisoned children and adults, DMSA 
significantly increases urinary lead excretion, and, at least transiently,
reduces the blood lead concentration. The safety profile of DMSA in both children
and adults is encouraging, with few clinically apparent or biochemical adverse
effects reported. However, clinical experience with DMSA is limited, and is not
sufficient to exclude the possibility that other more serious drug-related
adverse events including hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions may occur.
No data currently exist to determine whether drug-enhanced lead excretion with
DMSA (or any other chelating agent) is beneficial in reducing lead-related
neurotoxicity. The efficacy of DMSA in reducing neuropsychological morbidity, and
additional safety data, are key areas requiring additional study before DMSA can 
be clearly recommended as the chelating agent of choice for the treatment of
lead-poisoned children.

The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in the piglet using single photon emission

correlation.

Center, Washington, D.C. 20007.

Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scintigraphy has proved to
be an extremely sensitive renal imaging modality in children with genitourinary
pathology, including pyelonephritis, particularly when compared to 2-dimensional 
planar imaging. This study was undertaken to corroborate SPECT dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) scintigraphic findings with specific histopathology in acute
pyelonephritis. Unilateral vesicoureteral reflux was produced in 19 Yorkshire
piglets 3 to 4 weeks old. The bladders of 12 animals were inoculated with
Escherichia coli 2 weeks later, after baseline SPECT DMSA scans had been
obtained. The animals were then re-imaged at 3 (4), 7 (4) or 14 (4) days after
infection and sacrificed for histological evaluation. Seven purposefully
uninfected piglets with unilateral reflux served as controls and were followed
for up to 6 weeks before imaging and sacrifice. SPECT proved to be 97% sensitive 
and 93% specific in providing the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. The SPECT
findings were manifest by a spectrum of abnormal findings (mottling, striations, 
inner cortical scalloping and focal cortical defects), which correlated precisely
with the extent and severity of cortical involvement in the acute pyelonephritic 
process. We propose a new classification scheme for SPECT DMSA renal
scintigraphic imaging, and believe that this modality is exquisitely sensitive in
providing the diagnosis as well as in evaluating the extent of renal parenchymal 
involvement when acute pyelonephritis is induced in the animal model.

Effects of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on methyl mercury-induced
teratogenesis in mice.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Toxicology and Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of
Barcelona, Reus, Spain.

Methyl mercury has been reported to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in numerous
systems such as fish, birds, and mammals. meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
has been useful for prevention and treatment of mercury poisoning. In this study,
the protective activity of DMSA on methyl mercury-induced embryo/fetotoxicity was
evaluated in mice. A series of four DMSA injections was administered
subcutaneously to pregnant Swiss mice immediately after oral administration of 25
mg/kg methyl mercury chloride (MMC) given on Day 10 of gestation, and at 24, 48, 
and 72 hr thereafter. DMSA effectiveness was tested at 0, 80, 160, and 320
mg/kg/day. Oral administration of MMC resulted in a high rate of resorptions and 
dead fetuses as well as a reduced fetal body weight. Moreover, cleft palate
(46.9%) and various developmental variations were found in the positive control
group. Treatment with DMSA at 160 and 320 mg/kg/day significantly decreased the
embryolethality of MMC, whereas at 320 mg DMSA/kg/day the incidence of skeletal
anomalies and cleft palate (2.8%) was also significantly reduced. According to
these results, DMSA offers encouragement with regard to its therapeutic potential
for pregnant women exposed to methyl mercury.

meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid monoalkyl esters: effects on mercury levels in
mice.

Author information: 
(1)Ralph H. Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Charleston,

Seven monoesters of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were evaluated for
relative activities in mobilizing and promoting excretion of mercury in
mercury-laden mice. Compounds assessed were the ethyl (M-EDMS), n-propyl
(Mn-PDMS), isopropyl (Mi-PDMS), n-butyl (Mn-BDMS), isobutyl (Mi-BDMS), n-amyl
(Mn-ADMS), and isoamyl (Mi-ADMS) esters. 2,3-Dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS)
and DMSA were used as positive controls. After the first oral dose of each
compound at 0.5 mmol/kg, DMSA and DMPS reduced the corporal mercury burden 16%
and 24%, respectively, compared to controls, while the monoesters effected
reductions of 35% (M-EDMS) to 49% (Mi-ADMS). After the second treatment at the
same dose, the respective reductions produced by DMSA and DMPS were 24% and 38%, 
and those conferred by the monoesters ranged from 52% (M-EDMS) to 61% (Mn-BDMS). 
Determination of the comparative dose-response relationships of DMSA and Mi-ADMS 
on corporal and renal mercury concentrations revealed the monoester to be more
active than DMSA on both parameters at each dose used. The cumulative amount of
mercury excreted in urine by control mice over a 3-day period was 7.08
micrograms; this was increased 22%, 85%, and 94% by daily i.p. injections of
DMSA, DMPS, and Mi-ADMS, respectively, at a daily dose of 0.1 mmol/kg. The
respective cumulative 3-day totals recovered in feces from control mice and from 
mice treated with DMSA, DMPS, and Mi-ADMS were 9.76, 8.21, 10.44, and 11.73
micrograms. Parallel daily measurements of retained whole body radioactivity from
203Hg in mice were in good agreement with the values calculated from the
excretion data.

München, Federal Republic of Germany.

Gluconeogenesis is one of the metabolic pathways severely affected in acute
arsenic poisoning. We have studied gluconeogenesis in isolated kidney tubules of 
male Sprague-Dawley rats to screen various sulfur compounds for antidotal
properties against inorganic and organic arsenicals. Freshly prepared kidney
cells from starved rats synthesized glucose from added pyruvate (10 mmol/liter)
at a rate of 9.74 +/- 0.90 nmol/min/mg protein (mean +/- SD; n = 61).
Gluconeogenesis was inhibited almost 90% in the presence of phenylarsonate (700
mumol/liter), arsenate (350 mumol/liter), arsenite (30 mumol/liter), or PhAsO (1 
mumol/liter). mumol/liter). With effective antidotes the rate of gluconeogenesis 
was restored to almost control values within 10 min. Among 21 sulfur compounds
tested, only BAL, DMPS, and DMSA were effective in PhAsO poisoning. With
inorganic arsenic also DTE and DTT restored the rate of glucose formation. The
observed in vitro efficacies were in good agreement with in vivo results obtained
with male NMRI mice severely poisoned with arsenite (As2O3, 20 mg/kg
approximately 0.2 mmol As/kg) or PhAsO (3.4 mg/kg approximately 0.02 mmol As/kg).
We conclude that isolated kidney tubules are a useful in vitro screening system
(a) to compare the metabolic toxicity of various arsenicals and (b) to evaluate
potential antidotes.

Sonographic measurement of relative renal volume in children: comparison with
scintigraphic determination of relative renal function.

Sargent MA(1), Gupta SC.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Pendlebury,
United Kingdom.

OBJECTIVE: Observer error in the sonographic estimation of renal volume in
children has not been reported. Knowledge of the possible magnitude of error is
important in assessing abnormalities of renal growth. This study was undertaken
to determine the error of sonographic measurements of relative renal volume by
comparing them with measurements of relative renal function from
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 52 children, 2 months to 16 years old, 
who had DMSA scintigraphy and renal sonography on the same day. The sonographic
and scintigraphic studies were interpreted independently. Relative function of
the right kidney as shown by DMSA scintigrams in the direct posterior view was
compared with relative volume as determined with sonography. Renal volumes were
calculated by using the formula for a prolate ellipsoid. The standard deviation
of the differences (SDD) between relative renal function and relative renal
volume was calculated, and the limits of agreement were derived.
RESULTS: Thirty-three children had normal renal morphology on both studies.
Twenty-five kidneys in 19 children were abnormal on one or both studies,
including 14 definitely scarred kidneys in 12 children. Relative function of the 
right kidney in patients with normal kidneys was 50.1 +/- 2.5%, including one
possible outlying value. Normal relative volume of the right kidney was 49.1 +/- 
3.1%. In patients with normal kidneys, the difference between relative function
and relative volume of the right kidney was 1.0 +/- 2.8% with 95% limits of
agreement of 6.7% and -4.7%. Agreement between relative function and relative
volume was worse for children with abnormal kidneys; the mean difference was
2.0%, and the largest observed difference was 10.9%. Correlation between relative
renal volume and relative renal function for all patients was high (r = .94),
with 95% limits of agreement of 8.6% and -5.8%.
CONCLUSION: The agreement between relative renal function and relative renal
volume was good. In children with normal kidneys, estimated relative renal volume
derived from sonography can be expected to lie within 6.7% of the relative renal 
function determined scintigraphically.

In a patient with metastatic Hurthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid, a subgroup of
follicular carcinoma, scintigraphy with pentavalent 99mTc-labeled
dimercaptosuccinic acid (V)DMSA showed a significant uptake of the
radiopharmaceutical in all tumor sites. We suggest that the accumulation of
99mTc-(V)DMSA within metastases of Hurthle cell thyroid tumor may have a useful
role in the staging of these patients, especially when radioiodine fails to
concentrate.

In this report, we present the case of a patient suffering from recurrent acute
pyelonephritis and who had a hypertrophic right kidney following left
nephrectomy. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan is known to be of value in
the diagnosis of pyelonephritis, based on the detection of parenchymal
abnormalities. The kidney accumulation of
99mTc-mercaptoacetyl-glycylglycylglycine (MAG3) at 2-3 minutes also proves to
supply useful information on cortical function. This case illustrates that
99mTc-MAG3 study may be an efficient complementary examination to 99mTc-DMSA scan
in the detection and assessment of pyelonephritis.

Can renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate or 99mTc-DMSA uptake predict
outcome in experimental unilateral renal obstruction?

Kelleher JP(1), Anderson PJ, Gordon I, Ransley PG, Snell ME.

Single kidney glomerular filtration rate (SK GFR), single kidney blood flow (SK
BF) and differential renal function (DRF), using both technetium labelled
diethylene-pentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) and dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc-DMSA), were examined as predictors of outcome in a pig model of complete
unilateral ureteric obstruction. SK GFR and SK BF were unable to predict outcome 
following relief of obstruction but there was a high curvilinear correlation
between DRF assessed at the end of defined periods of obstruction and after
relief of obstruction using 99mTc-DMSA. Functional recovery was near complete
using DMSA when the loss in DRF did not exceed 30%, after which there was an
exponential decline in expected recovery. There was no difference between DRF
using 99mTc-DTPA or 99mTc-DMSA in controls or before or after obstruction but
significant differences between assessment by these radionuclides existed in the 
obstructed kidney at 24 h, 5 days, 10 days and 20 days. 99mTc-DMSA is a sensitive
agent in the prediction of outcome following acute complete obstruction in the
pig but its assessment of DRF in the obstructed kidney differs markedly from that
of 99mTc-DTPA.

Technetium-99m(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy was performed in two
patients with pathologically confirmed primary amyloidosis. Both patients had
tumor-like deposits of AL-type amyloid in the abdomen. Marked uptake of the
tracer by the amyloid deposits was noted. Technetium-99m-(V)DMSA scintigraphy
appears to be useful in detecting the distribution of amyloid deposits and in
determining the appropriate site for biopsy.

Comment in
    Arch Fr Pediatr. 1993 Dec;50(10):930-1.

BACKGROUND: The site of a urinary tract infection (UTI) is located by clinical
findings plus imaging techniques. Renal imaging with technetium
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) has shown promise but its efficacy for
detecting acute pyelonephritis is still debated as is its ability to
differentiate between acute, potentially curable disease and scarring, definitive
changes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The files of all the 166 patients that underwent one or two
(32 patients) 99mTc-DMSA imaging sessions for UTI in 1989 and 1990 in our
department were analysed. The results of this technique were compared with the
clinical and laboratory data and with those of other imaging techniques
(ultrasonography and retrograde voiding cystourethrogram). The patients (92 girls
and 74 boys, mean age: 5 years, range 15 days-17 years) were assigned to one of 3
categories: 1) acute pyelonephritis (27 patients), 2) low UTI (60 patients) and
3) uncertain UTI (79 patients), on the basis of the clinical and laboratory data.
RESULTS: The first 99mTc-DMSA imaging was normal in 110 children; changes were
unilateral in 45 and bilateral in 11 children. Images suggesting either acute or 
chronic changes were observed respectively in 19 and 48 children. 4 of the 7
acute changes were normalized on the second radioisotope scanning while 2 became 
worse; 19 of the 23 chronic changes were unchanged at the second scanning.
Radioisotope scanning changes were seen in 81% of the patients classified as
acute pyelonephritis and in only 27% of those with lower UTI. Reflux was detected
in 56% of abnormal kidneys and in 36% of normal kidneys. The results of
radioisotope scanning and ultrasound scan findings were not correlated in 24
patients (19 only abnormal radioisotope imaging, 5 only abnormal ultrasound
scan).
CONCLUSIONS: DMSA scans are useful for investigating and following UTI. They help
to distinguish acute pyelonephritis and lower UTI. It is a reliable method of
detecting structural abnormalities and identifying children at risk of
progressive renal damage.

Efficacy of dimercapto chelating agents for the treatment of poisoning by
percutaneously applied dichloro(2-chlorovinyl)arsine in rabbits.

Inns RH(1), Rice P.

Author information: 
(1)Clinical Toxicology and Pathology Section, Chemical & Biological Defence
Establishment, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK.

The efficacy of three chelating agents, BAL, DMPS and DMSA has been evaluated in 
rabbits as treatments for systemic dichloro(2-chlorovinyl)arsine [lewisite]
poisoning by the percutaneous route. Chelating agent treatment reduced the
incidence and severity of pathological liver changes following lewisite
poisoning. There was no marked difference between the three chelating agents for 
protection against lethality when screened at an equimolar dose of 40 mumol kg-1.
The results indicated DMPS and DMSA may prolong survival time compared with BAL. 
The low toxicity of DMPS and DMSA compared to BAL enabled doses of 160 mumol kg-1
on a more prolonged dosing schedule to be used for DMPS and DMSA. This schedule
showed DMPS and DMSA to give a significant improvement in protection against the 
lethal effects of percutaneous lewisite compared to that of BAL. It was concluded
that DMPS and DMSA have significant advantages over BAL for use as treatment for 
systemic lewisite poisoning.

Complexes of technetium-99m with phosphomycin, obtained by pH shifting:
biological characteristics, whole-body autoradiography, gamma-camera study.

Castanheira I(1), Sawas-Dimopoulou C.

Author information: 
(1)LNETI, Sacavem, Portugal.

Phosphomycin (phos), a large spectrum antibiotic with preferential localization
into the kidneys, can be labeled with technetium-99m at various pHs. However, the
final pH in the labeling of phos by [99mTc]pertechnetate in the presence of SnCl2
seems to play a significant role in determining the biological properties of the 
final labeled product. Radiopharmacological characteristics of various forms of
99mTc-phos obtained at pHs 6.8, 4.5 and 2.5 were studied in mice, rats and
rabbits. Significant differences in these products were shown by biodistribution 
studies in Balb/C mice and Wistar rats and confirmed by whole-body
autoradiographies in mice and gamma-camera studies in rats and rabbits.
99mTc-phos, pH 6.8, has a high uptake in kidneys from 2 min after injection
(10.25 +/- 1.11 %ID) to 3 h after injection (8.26 +/- 0.42 %ID) and a rapid
urinary excretion (19.9 +/- 7.35 %ID at 2 min after injection and 75.11 +/- 3.48 
%ID at 3 h). Intrarenal pharmacokinetics studied by autoradiography showed a high
concentration in the inner medulla and pelvis at 1 min after injection followed
by an increased localization in kidney cortex, like 99mTc-DMSA. Preferential
uptake in bones was shown by 99mTc-phos, pH 2.5, from 5 min to 3 h after
injection (15.05 +/- 2.67 %ID at 3 h compared to 1.79 +/- 0.19 %ID of 99mTc-phos,
pH 6.8, at the same time). A high urinary excretion of 99mTc-phos, pH 2.5, is
shown as in the case of other bone agents (76.5 +/- 3.46 %ID at 3 h
post-injection) but without any kidney retention (1.80 +/- 0.26 %ID in kidneys 3 
h post-injection).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Preparation and biological characteristics of 99mTc-diol a renal agent.

Castanheira I(1), Sawas-Dimopoulou C, Paulo A, Neves M, Patricio L.

Author information: 
(1)LNETI, Sacavem, Portugal.

The present work concerns the production of 1,2-dihydroxypropyl-1-phosphonic acid
(diol) by acid hydrolysis of (-cis) 1,2-epoxypropylphosphonic acid
(phosphomycin), and its formulation as a kit easily labeled with
[99mTc]pertechnetate. Biodistribution studies and whole-body autoradiographies in
mice show that 99mTc-diol has a specific affinity for the kidneys: it is rapidly 
cleared from the blood and excreted in urine (12.09 +/- 6.40% ID are excreted in 
urine at 5 min and 70.81 +/- 2.41% ID at 30 min post-injection). Part of the
injected activity remains in the kidney cortex sufficiently long to permit kidney
imaging (5.66 +/- 0.91% ID is still in kidneys 1 h post-injection). In comparison
with other agents which also localize in the kidney cortex, such as 99mTc-DMSA
and 99mTc-glucoheptonate (99mTc-GHA), the main differences are the following: the
peak of renal activity is reached early in the 5 min post-injection period for
99mTc-diol, only at about 10 min post-injection for 99mTc-GHA and after 3 h
post-injection for 99mTc-DMSA. The uptake of 99mTc-diol by other organs,
especially by bones, is much smaller than in the case of 99mTc-DMSA (1.25 +/-
0.11% ID of 99mTc-diol compared to 11.31 +/- 1.17% ID of 99mTc-DMSA, 1 h
post-injection). Unlike 99mTc-DMSA, the biodistribution of 99mTc-diol is not
significantly influenced by acid-base imbalance, in addition, its renal uptake
decreases in the presence of probenecid whereas its urinary excretion
increases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Scintigraphy and sonography in reflux nephropathy: a comparison.

Riccabona M(1), Ring E, Maurer U, Füger G, Nicoletti R.

Author information: 
(1)University Hospital Graz, Department of Pediatrics, Austria.

The evaluation of reflux nephropathy (RNP) is a major task in the following up of
children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Adequate monitoring of RNP development
depends on the frequent use of sonographical and scintigraphical examinations. In
order to evaluate the accuracy of sonography in monitoring RNP 63 patients
suffering from VUR (mean age: 8.8 years, range: newborn to 18 years, male:female 
= 19:44) were examined prospectively. We calculated renal size sonographically
and compared our data to static and dynamic renographic findings. Our results
showed a good correlation between relative DMSA uptake and sonographically
estimated relative renal size (r = 0.95, P < 0.001), whereas not unexpectedly the
correlation between relative kidney function and sonographically estimated renal 
size was poor (r = 0.83, P < 0.01). We therefore believe, that in monitoring
children with VUR, sonography can offer accurate information on questions about
renal size and renal parenchymal structure as well as pelvic distention. With
very small kidneys as well as with kidneys showing severe dilatation and above
all for evaluating renal function, scintigraphy proved to be the better method.

DMSA scintigraphy in renal duplex system.

Kullendorff CM(1), Wallin L.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Surgery, University of Lund, Sweden.

During a 4-year period 40 children (13 boys and 27 girls) with renal duplex
system were examined with DMSA scintigraphy. The age at the investigation varied 
from 18 days to 9 years, mean 2.5 years. Duplicated system existed in 52 kidneys,
bilaterally in 12 cases, right-sided in 10 and left-sided in 18 cases. The renal 
DMSA scintigraphy of the 52 duplicated kidneys revealed insignificant parenchymal
damage in 19 kidneys. Moderate parenchymal damage existed in 10 kidneys. In the
remaining 23 kidneys, severely deteriorated function of the upper moiety was
found in 15 cases and of the lower pole in 9 cases, as both moieties were
affected in one kidney. The function of the severely deteriorated moiety varied
between 0% and 14%, mean 5.7% of the total renal function. All the 23 cases with 
severely deteriorated function were operated upon, 22 with heminephrectomy and
one with nephrectomy. The assessment of parenchymal function of the separate
parts of the kidney with duplex system by DMSA scintigraphy is of great value in 
the decision of management and surgical procedure.

The detection of nasopharynx carcinoma in technetium-99m (V) dimercaptosuccinic
acid SPECT imaging.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan,
Republic of China.

Twenty-seven patients (24 men, 3 women; ages: 39-74 years) were diagnosed as
having squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx (NPC) as confirmed by
pathologic findings of biopsies. In addition, three of the 27 patients had
metastases to neck lymph nodes. The results of 2-4-hour SPECT images of the head 
and neck after intravenous injection of 15-20 mCi of Tc-99m (V) DMSA were
compared with normal Tc-99m (V) DMSA images and CT of heads and necks. The
results showed that of the 27 NPC cases, none of the patients had a significant
uptake of Tc-99m (V) DMSA. However, in the three cases complicated with
metastases of neck lymph nodes, the metastatic lesions could be detected by
Tc-99m (V) DMSA. Our results challenge previous reports in which carcinomas of
the head and neck were detected by Tc-99m (V) DMSA. The tumor-seeking agent
Tc-99m (V) DMSA is not a good choice for the detection of NPC among malignancies 
of the head and neck.

Can ultrasound reliably detect renal scarring in children with urinary tract
infection?

Tasker AD(1), Lindsell DR, Moncrieff M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.

One hundred children with a proven urinary tract infection were studied
prospectively using both ultrasound (US) and 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scintigraphy to assess the efficacy of US in the detection of renal scarring.
Sixty-nine girls and 31 boys with an age range of 0.5-11.8 years were studied.
DMSA scintigraphy detected 19 scarred kidneys in 17 children. Scarring was
classified as mild, moderate or gross. US detected a total of seven of the
scarred kidneys (sensitivity 37%). US detected 0/6 kidneys with mild scarring,
1/7 kidneys with moderate scarring and 6/6 kidneys with gross scarring. Four
kidneys with scarring on DMSA showed abnormalities other than scarring on US.
8/19 scarred kidneys were thought to be normal on US. It is important to detect
renal scarring in young children and US cannot be relied upon for this purpose.
It should therefore be supplemented with DMSA scintigraphy.

Studies on the preparation and isomeric composition of 186Re- and

The preparative conditions for 186Re(V)DMSA and 188Re(V)DMSA (DMSA =
meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid), beta-emitting radiopharmaceuticals that have been 
shown to localize in medullary thyroid carcinoma, require modification depending 
on the amount of carrier rhenium and the chemical form and medium in which the
rhenium is supplied. Preparative conditions are described for use with
carrier-free 188ReO4- in saline, and for use with 186ReO4- in saline, sodium
hydroxide or nitric acid. Preparation of 186Re(V)DMSA (carrier present up to 2 mg
per 2.5 ml reaction volume) requires a DMSA:SnCl2:Re ratio of 10:5:1 at 100
degrees C for 30 min. Addition of excess nitric acid or hydrochloric acid up to a
concentration of 155 mM does not reduce the yield from 100%. A commercial DMSA
kit vial (e.g. Amerscan DMSA) can be used for preparation of 188Re(V)DMSA
(carrier free) provided the required activity is in a volume of less than 1 ml
per vial. A convenient method of concentrating the 188Re generator eluate to the 
required volume is described.

When studying a child with urinary tract infection it is important to detect and 
localize any renal (scar) or urologic anomaly. Here we study the information
obtained using: renal and vesical ultrasound (US), DMSA scan and radiologic or
isotopic cystogram.METHODS: We studied 148 children with more than one urinary
tract infection and/or pyelonephritis; their mean age was 35.9 months (1-148
months); 55% were girls. The three diagnostic examinations--US, DMSA scan and
cystogram were made in the order; the DMSA scan or cystogram was never made
sooner than one month after the UTI.
RESULTS: In 42% of the children the three exams were normal; 4 of these children 
had another UTI and the urodynamic study revealed vesical disfunction. 11% had
renal scars (DMSA scan) with normal US and cystogram; 30% had VUR, 50% of which
had an altered US and 57% had renal scars on the DMSA scan. 12% of the children
had an altered US with a cystogram showing no VUR; 66% of these had renal scars. 
4% had vesical anomalies on the US and cystogram.
CONCLUSION: The three exams chosen were able to direct the diagnostic approach of
UTI, being sufficient in most of the cases. We would like to emphasize the
importance of the DMSA scan in diagnosing unsuspected renal scars.

[Renal function of contralateral kidney after total or partial removal of kidney 
with ectopic ureter].

[Article in Japanese]

Kaneda T(1), Konda R, Orikasa S, Sakai K, Ota S, Abe Y, Hatakeyama T, Ikeda S,
Kuji S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Tohoku University School of Medicine.

The effects of partial or total removal of the kidney with ectopic ureter on the 
contralateral kidney were evaluated using DMSA renal uptake rate on 8 patients.
After partial nephrectomy on 6 cases, the affected residual kidneys showed
significant decrease in DMSA renal uptake rate in 2 cases in which the extirpated
kidneys had normal renal tissue in part but did not show significant change in
DMSA uptake rate in 4 cases in which the extirpated kidneys were dominated mainly
with dysplasia. Post-operative increase in DMSA uptake rate of the contralateral 
kidneys were significant in 3 of 4 patients who had the operation before they
became 2 years old. In 2 of these 3 cases, pre-operative scintigram showed
extremely low rate of DMSA renal uptake. Four cases aged 2 years old and over did
not show post-operative increase in the uptake rate. As we have previously
reported on the cases with hydronephrosis, these results suggest that 1)
existence of obstruction caused by ectopic ureter inhibit the development of the 
contralateral kidney and 2) the growth of the kidney can resume the release of
that obstruction, if the release is made while the kidneys are still in
developing stage.

Reversal of gallium arsenide-induced suppression of the antibody response by a
mixed disulfide metabolite of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Burns LA(1), Butterworth LF, Munson AE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Virginia,
Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been demonstrated to be an effective 
chelator of lead, mercury and arsenic in humans and in rodent experiments.
Studies involving cadmium exposure have typically shown DMSA to be less effective
than 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid, and this is possibly due to an
inability of DMSA to cross cell membranes and bind intracellularly-bound metal
ions. The present studies were designed to determine whether in vitro addition of
DMSA could effectively reverse arsenic-induced immunosuppression in splenocytes
exposed in vivo to gallium arsenide (GaAs; 200 mg/kg, intratracheally). In those 
investigations, DMSA (25-100 microM) was incapable of reversing suppression of
the in vitro-generated antibody response induced by in vivo exposure to GaAs.
Addition of the recently synthesized 2:1 mixed disulfide (L-cysteine-DMSA)
metabolite of DMSA (0.1-100 microM) to cultures of splenocytes exposed in vitro
to GaAs (50 microM) dose-dependently reversed GaAs-induced suppression of the
antibody-forming cell response with no effect on the vehicle (complete media)
response or on cell viability, indicating that the metabolite retained binding
capacity. Unlike DMSA, however, addition of the 2:1 mixed disulfide metabolite to
splenocyte cultures exposed in vivo to vehicle (0.05% Tween 80 in saline) or GaAs
dose-dependently partially reversed GaAs-induced suppression. The reversal of
suppression could not be attributed to cleavage of L-cysteine from the 2:1 mixed 
disulfide metabolite, as addition of equimolar concentrations of L-cysteine or
L-cystine (0.2-200 microM) to in vitro generated antibody cultures of splenocytes
exposed in vivo to vehicle or GaAs had no effect on the GaAs-induced
suppression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Comparison of planar and SPECT 99Tcm-DMSA scintigraphy for the detection of renal
cortical defects in children.

Mouratidis B(1), Ash JM, Gilday DL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Renal cortical scintigraphy with 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid is an excellent
imaging modality for the detection of renal cortical defects in children
presenting with vesicoureteric reflux and urinary tract infections. Single photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT) has proven increased sensitivity over planar
scintigraphy for lesion detection in the heart, liver and brain. However, its
role in the evaluation of renal cortical defects compared to planar scintigraphy 
has not been fully assessed. We wished to determine whether SPECT increases the
sensitivity for detecting renal cortical defects in children compared to
high-resolution planar scintigraphy. Forty-one children (90 renal units) with
underlying vesicoureteric reflux and/or recently treated urinary tract infection 
(UTI) were evaluated. There was no statistically significant difference in the
number of defects detected between a single-head SPECT system and high-resolution
planar scintigraphy, 24 and 20, respectively (P = 0.54). There were four defects 
detected by SPECT not reported by planar scintigraphy; two of these were only
seen retrospectively on planar scintigraphy. There were two children with renal
cortical defects detected by SPECT and not by planar scintigraphy. All defects
defected by planar scintigraphy were detected by SPECT. It is concluded that
although the risk of missing renal cortical defects is low when using
high-resolution, three-view planar scintigraphy, SPECT should be employed
whenever feasible. Single photon emission computed tomography detected renal
cortical defects in children not diagnosed by planar scintigraphy and hence
patient management may be altered.

Nine different sulphur-based chelators, including dithiols and dithiocarbamates, 
were examined for their ability to remove Po-210 from the rat. In general,
treatments merely caused a redistribution of Po-210 in the body. Greatest
reduction of Po-210 in blood was achieved by 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BAL), sodium
diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), and N-(2,3-dimercaptopropyl) phthalamidic acid
(DMPA). Nearly all the compounds tested decreased Po-210 in the spleen and
muscle. On the other hand, BAL and DDTC substantially increased the accumulation 
of Po-210 in the brain while DMPA, DMPS (sodium
2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulphonate) and DMSA (meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid)
increased by several times the Po-210 in kidneys. A less pronounced increase of
Po-210 was sometimes observed in liver (due to DDTC and DMPA) and in muscle (due 
to BAL and DDTC). Three of the dithiocarbamates (BGDTC, MeOBGDTC and BLDTC) did
not increase accumulation of Po-210 in the brain and muscle but they reduced
Po-210 in blood to a lesser degree than DDTC. A derivative of DMSA (Mi-ADMS)
reduced Po-210 in blood, bone and muscle more than DMSA, but at the same time
increased Po-210 in the kidney. When BAL or DDTC were combined with other agents 
there was a greater reduction in the whole-body burden of Po-210. Removal of
Po-210 from the bone, spleen and kidneys by BAL was increased by repeated
treatment. However, under similar experimental conditions the effect of a single 
injection of BAL on Po-210 in blood was less pronounced when the period of
observation was prolonged. Total-body retention of Po-210 could not be reduced to
less than 85% of the untreated controls by any of the chelators tested. In spite 
of this some of them (BAL, DMPS, DMSA, DMPA) could still have a useful role in
reducing the toxicity of Po-210.

Measurements were performed on beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-MG), alpha
1-microglobulin (alpha 1-MG), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) as indices of
renal tubular damage and microalbumin as an index of renal glomerular damage in
204 cases with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Investigations were made on
the relationship between each index and extent of renal cortical damage from the 
findings of 99mTc-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) renoscintigraphy, and also on
the changes of each index before and after antireflux operation. At the first
examination, high values of urinary beta 2-MG, alpha 1-MG, NAG and albumin were
noted in 36%, 40%, 50% and 34% of cases with VUR respectively. Almost all the
cases with high indices values before the operation showed improvement in those
values accompanied with disappearance of VUR after the operation. These findings 
suggest that renal tubular and glomerular damage were induced by the sterile
reflux itself. High values of urinary indices were confirmed in 16% (beta 2-MG), 
40% (alpha 1-MG), 27% (NAG) and 32% (albumin) cases after a lapse of 2 years or
longer since antireflux operation or spontaneous disappearance of VUR. In some of
these cases indices values showed some improvement but have not returned to
normal levels, and in other cases indices were within normal limits
preoperatively but turned out to be high levels during the observation period
even after the disappearance of VUR. Most of these cases were accompanied with
severe cortical damage of unilateral or bilateral kidneys on DMSA
renoscintigraphy. Based on these findings, we suggest that overload to residual
nephron, caused by reduced mass of functional nephron, is playing an important
role on raising the values of various urinary indices.

Study of group of 61 patients, nephrectomized as a result of various diseases and
who before and three months after surgery underwent blood pressure, effective
renal plasma flow (EPFF) and unilateral renal function determinations in order to
verify the compensating ability of the remaining kidney. Effective renal plasma
flow was determined by a single injection and removal of six serial blood samples
with 125-I-Hippuran. Unilateral renal function was determined from the relative
uptake of 99mTc-DMSA 24 hours after injection. The patients were divided into
four groups according to their overall and unilateral renal function as well as
the presence or absence of hypertension. Patients with normal EPFF and
symmetrical renal function showed a significantly increase in the function of the
remaining kidney after surgery (p < 0.001). Patients with normal or slightly
reduced EPFF (< 10%) and highly asymmetrical unilateral function as well as those
with decreased EPFF (> 10%) and symmetrical or asymmetrical unilateral renal
function did not increased the function of the remaining kidney after
nephrectomy, and hypertensive patients whose blood pressure returned to normal
values after nephrectomy had a decreased function of the remaining kidney after
surgery (< 0.001). It is concluded that it is possible to predict the functional 
behaviour of the remaining kidney after nephrectomy, and that the compensating
ability will basically depend on the previously existing (overall and unilateral)
renal function as well as the presence or absence of hypertension.

Rational use of CT in acute pyelonephritis: findings and relationships with
reflux.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Radiology, Hôpital Charles Nicolle, University
Hospital, Rouen, France.

Enhanced renal CT scanners were performed in 38 children (82% girls) to rule out 
acute pyelonephritis. Patients were divided in 2 groups on the basis of clinical 
presentation and bacteriology data. In patients of group A (n = 16, preliminary
study), upper urinary tract infection (UTI) was certain. CT confirmed the
diagnosis in all but 3 patients (a 2-year-old child and 2 patients with UTI
developed on prior obstruction). In subsequently studied patients of group B (n =
22), clinical findings or bacteriology data were negative or questionable. CT
made the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in 11 patients. As well as DMSA
scintigraphy, CT scanner can help to diagnose or to rule out upper UTIs in
difficult cases. In all boys of both groups, ipsilateral vesico-ureteric reflux
(VUR) was found by subsequent voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) on the side of
pyelonephritis. In girls, this correlation was shown in only 7 of the 25 kidneys 
with pyelonephritis. This result supports the hypothesis of a gender-dependent
contamination. We believe that absence of radiologic reflux cannot exclude the
possibility of bacterial crossings of ureteric meatus capable to lead to genuine 
upper UTIs.

The importance of 99mTc DMSA scanning in the localization of childhood urinary
tract infections.

Buyan N(1), Bircan ZE, Hasanoğlu E, Oztürk E, Bayhan H, Rota S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatrics, Gazi University Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.

The use of 99mTechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc DMSA) scanning for the
early diagnosis of upper urinary tract infections has been preferred for a few
years. In this research we investigated the use of 99mTc DMSA scanning in the
localization of renal parenchymal involvement in urinary tract infection.
Twenty-four children presenting with first acute urinary tract infection were
studied. Investigations included physical examination, white blood cell count
(WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP),
antibody-coated bacteria (ACB) and early 99mTc DMSA scanning. 99mTc DMSA scanning
was taken as the gold standard method in determining renal parenchymal
inflammation. According to the 99mTc DMSA scanning the sensitivity of clinical
findings was 57.14%, WBC 23.80%, ESR 33.33%, CRP 14.28% and ACB 71.42% in the
localization of urinary tract infection. We propose early 99mTc DMSA scanning
performed around the time of infection as a good technique for localization of
the level of infection in the urinary tract.

Intra- and interobserver variability in interpretation of DMSA scans using a set 
of standardized criteria.

Patel K(1), Charron M, Hoberman A, Brown ML, Rogers KD.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Nuclear Medicine, Children's Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA.

A set of criteria was developed to standardize assessment of DMSA renal
scintigraphy which were performed to evaluate children for acute pyelonephritis
and renal scarring. This study was undertaken to assess intra- and interobserver 
variability in the interpretation of DMSA renal scintigraphy using these
criteria. Renal contours and parenchyma were assessed in three zones. Contours
were assessed as normal or abnormal and parenchymal defects were evaluated in
terms of character, shape and degree in three regions (upper and lower pole and
midzone). Two nuclear medicine physicians blindly reviewed 57 DMSA scintigraphy
on two occasions each. Disagreement of each observer's evaluation of the same
scintigraphy on two different occasions was described as intraobserver
variability, and the comparison between readings by each of the two observers was
described as interobserver variability. High levels of intra- (95.9% and 90.6%
respectively, p < 0.05) and interobserver agreement (84.4%, p < 0.05) were
demonstrated. There were minor differences in inconsistencies between the two
kidneys or different kidney zones. We conclude that standardization of criteria
resulted in higher intra- and interobserver consistency in interpretation of DMSA
scintigraphy.

Conceptual and practical advances in the measurement and clinical management of
lead toxicity.

Graziano JH(1).

Author information: 
(1)Division of Environmental Sciences, Columbia University Medical Center, New
York, New York 10032.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss issues which relate to the risks and
benefits of pharmacologic intervention in children with elevated blood lead (BPb)
concentrations. In January, 1991, 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA; succimer or 
CHEMET) was approved by the FDA for administration to children with blood lead
concentrations of 45 micrograms/dl or higher. Thus, it is now considerably
simpler to treat children with elevated BPb's. DMSA is orally actively,
relatively safe and specific, and can, in some situations, be used on an
out-patient basis. The author is concerned that the recent CDC statement on lead 
poisoning, whose aim is to reduce (by various means) children's BPb's below 10
micrograms/dl, may unintentionally encourage pediatricians to treat children with
relatively low BPb's with DMSA, both for medical and legal reasons. Should
children with BPb's of less than 45 ug/dl be treated, and why? The risks and
benefits of treatment in such children are uncertain. A randomized, placebo
controlled, double-blind drug intervention trial is needed (and justified) in
order to more carefully assess the benefits and the risks associated with the
treatment of lower BPb's.

Trends in the management of childhood lead poisonings.

Rosen JF(1), Markowitz ME.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore
Medical Center, Bronx, New York 10467.

It is unknown whether prompt medical management (with or without chelation
therapy) and environmental intervention have beneficial effects other than
stopping the progression towards symptomatic childhood lead poisoning. Stated
differently, does prompt intervention have substantive beneficial effects or are 
untreated lead toxic children with blood lead values between 25-54 micrograms/dl 
irrevocably damaged by the time of their identification. We are carrying out a
prospective treatment outcome study with CaNa2EDTA (when indicated) at our Center
to hopefully answer this critical question, within the context of a
multidisciplinary study. The results in 162 children indicate that environmental 
and medical management produce significant reductions in blood lead, erythrocyte 
protoporphyrin and the lead diuresis during a CaNa2EDTA provocative test.
However, CaNa2EDTA treatment failed to decrease bone lead values dramatically,
measured by L-line x-ray fluorescence, six months after enrollment in any patient
group (treated or untreated with CaNa2EDTA). The uses of L-line x-ray
fluorescence in this study and K-line x-ray fluorescence measurements of lead in 
bone in other reported studies open a wide time window of months to years of lead
exposure, compared to 30-45 days, the time of exposure captured by blood lead
levels. As with all chelating agents, DMSA should be administered to children in 
lead free housing, after this drug's toxicity is more widely assessed. The
potential capability of DMSA to ameliorate neurobehavioral deficits produced by
lead must be systematically assessed and compared with CaNa2EDTA in a randomized,
controlled study before the use (s) of either drug become uncritically accepted
as the treatment of choice for childhood lead poisoning, in addition to full
abatement.

Acute effects of the heavy metal antidotes DMPS and DMSA on circulation,
respiration, and blood homoeostasis in dogs.

Klimmek R(1), Krettek C, Werner HW.

Author information: 
(1)Walther-Straub-Institut für Pharmakologie und Toxikologie,
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, München, Germany.

The heavy metal antidotes sodium-2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were investigated in anaesthetized dogs
for their effects on a variety of physiological variables and parameters. In
addition, the influence of both dithiols on oxygen consumption and
ferrihaemoglobin production was studied in blood and red blood cells in vitro.
DMPS (15 and 75 mg/kg i.v.) did not affect respiration, central venous pressure, 
left ventricular pressure or cardiac output and showed only marginal,
statistically non-significant effects on aortic and effective perfusion pressure.
In contrast to the slight, non-significant changes due to DMPS (15 mg/kg i.v.),
an equimolar dose of DMSA (12 mg/kg i.v.) led to a slight transient decrease in
femoral blood pressure with strong reflex tachycardia and increase in blood flow.
The higher DMPS dose (75 mg/kg i.v.), however, caused marked decreases in femoral
blood pressure and blood flow, strong changes in blood gases and pH, and
lactacidosis. Most of the physiological variables and parameters did not return
to the initial level by 60 min. The R-spike of the electrocardiogram decreased,
and the T-wave increased. Experiments on the denervated hind leg indicate that
DMPS may be a direct vasodilator. The fall of blood pressure due to DMPS was
markedly reduced when 30% ferrihaemoglobin had been formed by
4-dimethylaminophenol.HCl (DMAP). The highest DMPS dose (150 mg/kg i.v.) provoked
circulatory failure and respiratory arrest. Artificial ventilation with room air 
restored spontaneous respiration, but one of three animals did not survive this
dose for more than 90 min. DMPS and DMSA reacted with oxygen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

Compensatory renal response after unilateral partial and whole volume high-dose
irradiation of the human kidney.

Leeuwenhoek Huis), Amsterdam.

Renal function was prospectively analysed in 26 patients treated with
radiotherapy for various types of malignancies. In patients with gastric
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma stage I-II (gNHL, n = 5), the
99mTc-diethylene-triamine-penta-acetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) renal uptake and the
relative 99mTc-dimercapto-succinyl acid (99mTc-DMSA) accumulation decreased
gradually and concomitantly in the high-dose, whole-volume irradiated left kidney
(40 Gy/5, 5 weeks), down to 25 +/- 10% (mean +/- 1 S.E.M.) and 31 +/- 11%,
respectively, after 6-9 years. The absolute 99mTc-DMSA uptake in the left kidney 
declined down to 33 +/- 12% whereas in the low-dose, whole-volume irradiated
right kidney (12-13 Gy/3 weeks) it increased up to 187 +/- 11%. When considering 
renal volume changes with single photon emission computed tomography, the left
kidney in the gNHL patients was reduced to 30 +/- 13%, with, surprisingly, a
contralateral enlargement up to only 119 +/- 7% (P < 0.05). The overall renal
function in this group of patients, as assessed by creatinine clearance and by
[125I]iothalamate/[131I]hippuran clearance was reduced to 48-68%. In the
Hodgkin's disease patients (HD, n = 7) given 40 Gy in 4 weeks to 30-50% of the
left kidney, the 99mTc-DTPA filtration and the relative 99mTc-DMSA uptake in the 
left kidney was reduced to 75 +/- 4% and 81 +/- 3%, respectively. The absolute
99mTc-DMSA changes were 78 +/- 10% and 135 +/- 13%, respectively. No significant 
renal functional alterations were observed in patients with either ovarian
carcinoma (n = 7) or seminoma (n = 7). These data suggest a significant,
compensatory response of the non-irradiated or low-dose irradiated kidney which, 
however, appears to be incomplete after contralateral, whole-volume, high-dose
irradiation. Such compensatory response might be overestimated when considering
only relative or absolute changes in radioactivity uptake.

Therapeutic efficacy of new dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) analogues in acute
arsenic trioxide poisoning in mice.

Gesundheitswesens der Bundeswehr, BSW, Garching, Germany.

The therapeutic efficacy of six newly synthesized analogues of dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) was investigated in acute arsenic trioxide poisoning in mice.
Meso-2,3-di(acetylthio)succinic acid (DATSA) and meso-2,3-
di(benzoylthio)succinic acid (DBTSA) are analogues of DMSA with protected thiol
groups ("prodrugs"), and DMDMS, DEDMS, DnPDMS, and DiPDMS are various di-esters
of DMSA with methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and isopropyl alcohols, respectively.
Thirty minutes after s.c. injection of an LD80 of arsenic trioxide (65 mumol/kg) 
male NMRI mice were treated with a single equimolar dose (0.7 mmol/kg) of DMSA
i.p. or one of the analogues i.p. or via gastric tube (i.g.). Control animals
received arsenic trioxide and saline 30 min later. The survival rate was recorded
for 30 days. All of the animals treated with DMSA i.p. survived and all controls 
died within 2 days. Administered i.g., DATSA and DBTSA increased the survival
rate to 29% and 43%, and injected i.p. to 86%. Treatment with DMDMS i.p. and
i.g., and with DEDMS, DnPDMS, and DiPDMS i.g. did not reduce lethality. Given
i.p., DnPDMS increased the survival rate to 72%, and DEDMS and DiPDMS to 86%,
respectively. To investigate the efficacy of the DMSA analogues in reducing the
tissue content of arsenic, male NMRI mice received an s.c. injection of an LD5 of
arsenic trioxide containing a tracer dose of 73-As(III) (42.5 mumol/kg body wt). 
Thirty minutes later, saline (controls) or a single equimolar dose (0.7 mmol/kg) 
of DMSA i.p., or one of the analogues i.p. or i.g. was administered. The arsenic 
content of various organs (blood, liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, spleen, small
intestine, large intestine, brain, testes, skeletal muscle, and skin) at 30 min, 
2 h, 4 h, 6 h, and 8 h after the arsenic injection was measured using a gamma
counter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The effect of iron limitation on expression of the aerobic and anaerobic electron
transport pathway genes in Escherichia coli.

Cotter PA(1), Darie S, Gunsalus RP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of California,
Los Angeles 90024.

To determine whether the aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathways of
Escherichia coli are regulated in response to iron availability, strains
containing lacZ reporter fusions to the cydAB, cyoABCDE, narGHJI, dmsABC and
frdABCD operons were grown in medium limited for iron by use of the chelator,
2,2'-dipyridyl. Under anaerobic conditions, expression of the anaerobic
respiratory pathway operons, narG-lacZ, dmsA-lacZ and frdA-lacZ, was reduced
14-16 fold when iron was limited. In contrast, expression of the aerobic pathway 
operons, cyoA-lacZ and cydA-lacZ, was elevated modestly. Iron-dependent
transcriptional control of these operons was independent of the fur gene which
encodes an iron-and-DNA-binding regulatory protein. The expression of fnr-lacZ
was relatively unaffected by iron limitation suggesting that Fnr levels in the
cell do not change in response to iron. The above findings suggest that in
addition to Fur, some other cellular protein may bind iron for reporting and
regulating iron-dependent cell functions.

Mobilization of lead in mice by administration of monoalkyl esters of
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid.

The following six monoalkyl esters of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
were synthesized and evaluated for relative activities in mobilizing lead from
kidneys and brains of lead-bearing mice: n-propyl (Mn-PDMS), i-propyl (Mi-PDMS), 
n-butyl (Mn-BDMS), i-butyl (Mi-BDMS), n-amyl (Mn-ADMS) and i-amyl
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (Mi-ADMS). DMSA was used as a positive control. When
each was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) as a single dose of 2.0 mmol/kg,
DMSA lowered the kidney lead concentration 52%, while the monoesters effected
reductions of 54-75%. Mn-ADMS was toxic at this dose. DMSA lowered the brain lead
level 20% when given as a single dose, while the monoesters conferred reductions 
of 64-87%. When given as 5 daily i.p. injections at 0.5 mmol/kg, DMSA reduced the
kidney lead concentration 45%, while the monoesters caused reductions of 56-73%. 
DMSA lowered the brain lead concentration 35% on the 5-day treatment regimen,
while the monoesters evoked reductions of 59-75%. Mi-ADMS was equally effective
when given orally or i.p. The i.p. LD50 value of this analog in mice is 3.0
mmol/kg, a value which lies between the reported LD50 doses of DMSA (16.0
mmol/kg) and dimercaprol (1.1 mmol/kg). It is suggested that the ability of these
monoesters to cross cell membranes may account for their superiority to DMSA in
mobilizing brain lead in this animal model.

An essential element in the histological differentiation of medullary thyroid
cancer (MTC) from other thyroid tumors is the use of immunohistochemical methods.
The detection of calcitonin in the tumor cells is decisive. Factors which impair 
the prognosis of MTC are age (> 40 y), male sex, elevated DNA-content and mitotic
activity of the tumor cells, immunoreactivity against dopa decarboxylase,
histaminase and Leu-M1-antigen. Family screening is based mainly on
calcitonin-stimulation tests (using pentagastrin or calcium) as a genetic marker 
for routine screening is not available yet. Scintigraphic methods using
99mTc-(V)-DMSA, 201Tl-chloride or 99mTc-anti-CEA antibodies become more
important, especially in the detection of recurrent disease. Selective venous
blood sampling is another sensitive method for localizing recurrent disease.
Surgical treatment plays the dominant role in the management of MTC. Complete
thyroidectomy in conjunction with systematic lymphadenectomy is now the primary
treatment of choice.

Can technetium-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine replace
technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid in the exclusion of a focal renal defect?

Gordon I(1), Anderson PJ, Lythgoe MF, Orton M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Hospital for Sick Children, London, England.

The presence of focal renal damage dictates different management of a child with 
urinary tract infection (UTI) compared with children who have normal kidneys.
Technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic (DMSA) has a high sensitivity in the detection 
of a focal defect, and allows estimation of differential function. The
introduction of 99mTc-MAG3 with high renal extraction suggests that this may be
useful in children with UTI but its role remains speculative. Fifty-nine children
with previous UTI underwent both 99mTc-DMSA and MAG3 within 4 wk of each other.
Differential function and assessment of the images were undertaken. There is
close correlation (R2 = 0.97) between the differential function. Analysis of the 
99mTc-DMSA and functional MAG3 images showed that the functional image had a
specificity of 88% and a sensitivity of 88% in the detection of a focal
parenchymal defect. Technetium-99m-MAG3 in the clinical setting of a child with
UTl allows accurate assessment of differential function and a high probability of
detecting a focal renal abnormality.

99mTc(V)-DMSA accumulation in the damaged myocardium was clearly demonstrated.
These results suggested the possibility that 99mTc(V)-DMSA could be used as a

In patients with cervical metastases conventional examination by ultrasound, CT
or MRI imaging often fails to identify an unknown primary tumor. Also the
retrieval of a recurrent malignancy may be difficult. Scintigraphy, utilizing
technetium-99m (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid was chosen for a prospective study in 
17 patients to evaluate its properties for imaging metastasizing squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck. Scintigraphic findings were correlated with the
results of clinical examination and conventional imaging techniques. In all cases
the primary tumor revealed good uptake of 99mTc(v)DMSA. Manifest cervical
metastases could only be imaged in some cases. In future, therefore, 99mTc(v)DMSA
scanning may be used for the detection of unknown primary tumors. However, it
does not appear helpful in the evaluation of cervical nodes.

Diagnostic significance of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in
urinary tract infection.

A total of 106 children with symptomatic urinary tract infection (73 girls and 33
boys, 0-15.9 years of age) were studied by means of a dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scan, renal ultrasound, and a desmopressin test during infection and at
follow up approximately two months later. At follow up they were also
investigated by means of intravenous urography (IVU) and micturition
cystourethrography (MCU). During infection 23 children had a normal DMSA scan
while 83 children had an abnormal one. The median C reactive protein and SD score
for renal concentration capacity in the former group were 15 (range < 10-178)
mg/l and -1.0 SD score (range -2.4 to 1.8), respectively, and in the latter group
98 (range < 10-320) mg/l and -3.1 SD score (range -5.7 to 1.1), respectively. In 
the former group there was no significant finding in any child on ultrasound or
IVU and only one had significant vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (grade 3). At follow
up 51 children had a normal DMSA scan while 55 children showed persistent
changes. The median SD score for renal concentration capacity in the former group
was -0.9 SD score (range -3.2 to 1.4) and in the latter group -1.6 SD score
(range -4.6 to 2.5). No significant changes were found in the former group on
ultrasound or IVU and only two children had significant VUR (grade 3). In the
latter group 20 children showed changes on ultrasound, 15 showed changes on IVU, 
and 23 had VUR. These results suggest that a normal DMSA scan during or
approximately two months after urinary tract infection in children indicates a
low risk of finding significant pathology of the urinary tract.

Plain radiography, renography, and 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy before and after
extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for urolithiasis.

University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

Eighteen patients were evaluated before and 5 weeks after the first treatment
with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) using abdominal plain
radiography, 131I-hippuran probe renography, and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
scintigraphy. In 6 patients no urolithiasis was present on the post ESWL plain
radiograph, in 7 the size had decreased, and in 5 the stone mass was unchanged.
The renograms were within normal range in the 6 patients who were cured by ESWL, 
whereas this was the case for only 4 of the 12 who still had renal calculi. In 2 
patients pelvic stones had descended into the ureter after ESWL, and the
renograms indicated obstruction. Another 3 patients had ureteral stones, whereas 
in the remaining 7 patients only pelvic stones were found on the plain
radiographs. In no patient did the scintigrams reveal scars. It is concluded that
abdominal plain radiography of the urinary tract and probe renography are
complementary and sufficient in the monitoring of patients with urolithiasis post
ESWL.

Evaluation of acute urinary tract infection in children by dimercaptosuccinic
acid scintigraphy: a prospective study.

Australia.

A prospective study examining the incidence of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
abnormalities in children at the time of acute urinary tract infection, the
progression of these abnormalities following treatment and their correlation with
the presence of vesicoureteral reflux is reported. DMSA scans performed within 72
hours of presentation in 65 previously healthy children with acute urinary tract 
infection were abnormal in 34 (52%). The scan appearances of 30 of 36 (83%)
initially abnormal kidneys improved or became normal on the repeat DMSA study
performed at 3 to 6 months after the acute urinary tract infection. A cystogram
demonstrated significant vesicoureteral reflux in 11 of 45 cases (24%). Of these 
11 cases 10 had abnormal DMSA studies and 1 had dilated upper tracts on
ultrasound. Several conclusions may be drawn from our study. The incidence of
DMSA abnormalities at the time of acute urinary tract infection is high but these
abnormalities tend to resolve with time. An abnormal DMSA study at the time of
urinary tract infection identifies most children with significant vesicoureteral 
reflux, and in our series a combination of ultrasound and DMSA identified all
cases. This study may have major implications for the clinical investigation of
children with urinary tract infection.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy for the evaluation of pyelonephritis
and scarring: a review of experimental and clinical studies.

Rushton HG(1), Majd M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, D.C.

Renal cortical scintigraphy has been reported to be useful in children for
confirmation of the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. Subsequent experimental
studies have demonstrated that dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, when 
compared directly with histopathology, is highly reliable for the detection and
localization of parenchymal inflammatory changes associated with acute
pyelonephritis. Recent clinical studies of acute pyelonephritis using DMSA
scintigraphy reveal that the majority (50 to 91%) of children with febrile
urinary tract infections have abnormal DMSA renal scan findings and that the
majority of these children do not have demonstrable vesicoureteral reflux.
However, when vesicoureteral reflux is present, renal cortical abnormalities are 
demonstrated by DMSA scintigraphy in 79 to 86% of the kidneys. In children with
febrile urinary tract infections routine clinical and laboratory parameters are
not reliable in the differentiation of acute pyelonephritis, documented by DMSA
renal scan findings, from urinary tract infections without parenchymal
involvement. Furthermore, the presence of P-fimbriated Escherichia coli
associated with febrile urinary tract infections does not reliably predict those 
kidneys that have acute parenchymal inflammation demonstrated by DMSA renal
scans. DMSA is also the isotope agent of choice for the detection of renal
scarring. Clinical studies report greater sensitivity of DMSA renal scintigraphy 
for the detection of renal scarring when compared with the excretory urogram,
particularly in infants and young children. In a recent prospective study of
post-pyelonephritic renal scarring in children we found that acquired renal
scarring only occurs in sites corresponding exactly to previous areas of acute
pyelonephritis demonstrated by DMSA scintigraphy at the time of infection.
Furthermore, once acute pyelonephritis occurs, ultimate renal scarring is
independent of the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux. These findings
provide convincing evidence that renal parenchymal infection, rather than
vesicoureteral reflux, is the prerequisite for acquired (postnatal) renal
scarring. Vesicoureteral reflux as a risk factor for acquired renal scarring is
directly related to its role as a risk factor for acute pyelonephritis. We
conclude that DMSA scintigraphy is a valid tool for confirming the diagnosis of
acute pyelonephritis in children and for identifying kidneys at risk for
subsequent renal scarring.

Evaluation of a DMSA kit for instant preparation of 99mTc(V)-DMSA for tumour and 
metastasis scintigraphy.

Chauhan UP(1), Babbar A, Kashyap R, Prakash R.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Nuclear Medicine, Lucknow Marg, Delhi, India.

A kit has been developed to instantly prepare 99mTc(V)-DMSA. The freeze-dried kit
consisting of DMSA, stannous chloride and ascorbic acid in appropriate
proportions, produces quality 99mTc(V)-DMSA when mixed with 0.2 mL of 3.5% NaHCO3
solution and 2-4 mL of (99mTc)pertechnetate. The radiopharmaceutical
characterized by chromatography with ITLC-SG in 0.9% saline and horizontal paper 
electrophoresis in 50 mM vernol buffer, pH 8.6, at a potential gradient of 15
V/cm showed a different mobility with respect to 99mTc(III)-DMSA, a known agent
for kidney imaging. The new agent exhibited less plasma protein binding compared 
to that of 99mTc(III)-DMSA. Biodistribution of the pentavalent DMSA in mouse
demonstrated greater uptake in bone and muscle and lower uptake in liver and
kidney with respect to trivalent DMSA. The soft tissue tumour specificity and its
suitability for tumour scintigraphy was apparent from the scintigrams of mammary 
carcinoma in a C3H Jax mouse and medullary carcinoma in a patient. Brain
metastatic lesions were also visible in a breast carcinoma patient after
administering him with the agent.

[Evaluation of renal function and prediction of renal functional recovery in
children with unilateral hydronephrosis using renal pelvic urine].

[Article in Japanese]

In 29 children with unilateral hydronephrosis who underwent surgery at the age
from 2 months to 15 years (27 patients with ureteropelvic junction stenosis and 2
with obstructive megaureter), beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-MG), alpha
1-microglobulin (alpha 1-MG), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and albumin
were determined in renal pelvic urine from the hydronephrotic kidney to evaluate 
renal dysfunction accompanying urinary tract obstruction. Moreover, it was also
examined whether it is possible to predict functional recovery of the
hydronephrotic kidney on the basis of relation between these indices and pre- and
postoperative changes in renal dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake rate. The
values of beta 2-MG, alpha 1-MG, NAG and albumin in urine from the renal pelvis
were high in 48%, 50%, 75% and 83% of the patients, respectively. Among the
patients of one year and up, those with low preoperative DMSA uptake rate tended 
to have high values of beta 2-MG, alpha 1-MG and NAG. On the contrary, albumin
level was high in 78% of patients who had good preoperative DMSA uptake rate.
With respect to the relation between pre- and postoperative changes in DMSA
uptake rate and each index, beta 2-MG and alpha 1-MG were high in 73% and 62% of 
patients who exhibited a marked increase in postoperative DMSA uptake rate. In
patients without a remarkable change in DMSA uptake rate before and after
surgery, on the other hand, the values of these were high only in 25% and
36%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

A 7-year-old female was discovered to be severely hypertensive. Urinary
noradrenaline excretion and plasma noradrenaline level were elevated. Plasma
renin activity was markedly elevated. She was found to have a mass in the hilus
of the left kidney and left renal artery stenosis. Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) of the mass revealed an extremely bright lesion on T2 weighted image. DMSA 
renal scintigraphy revealed a low uptake rate (4.7%) in the left kidney. A
diagnosis of extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma associated with left sided renal
artery stenosis was made. The mass and left kidney were removed.
Electronmicroscopic examination of the mass revealed characteristic
neurosecretory granules. There was only slight fibrosis in the wall of the
removed left renal artery.

Protective effects of thiol containing chelating agents against liver injury
induced by hexavalent chromium in mice.

Ueno S(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Veterinary Public Health, School of Veterinary Medicine and
Animal Sciences, Kitasato University, Aomori, Japan.

The effects of the chelating agents, L-cysteine ethyl ester (LCEE), L-cysteine
methyl ester (LCME), N-acetyl-L-(+)-cysteine (NAC),
2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine
(MPG), and 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), on the distribution, excretion and
hepatotoxicity of ip injected hexavalent chromium were studied in male mice. The 
chelating agents (500 mg/kg) were injected iv as single doses given immediately
or 30 min after potassium dichromate (20 mg Cr/kg) as hexavalent chromium was
administered. When the chelating agents were injected immediately after the metal
compound was administered, LCEE, LCME, NAC, DMPS, and MPG reduced the chromium
contents in the liver and kidney, and facilitated the urinary excretion of
chromium. The liver injury induced by chromium, which was evaluated by serum
ornithine carbamyl transferase (OCT) activity, was prevented significantly by
LCEE, LCME, DMPS, and MPG. On the other hand, when these chelating agents were
injected at 30 min after the chromium administration, only DMSA could prevent the
liver injury induced by the metal, and decreased the chromium contents in the
liver. However, when DMSA was given at 3 hr after the metal administration, there
was no therapeutic effect on them. These results suggest that the chelating
agents tested may be useful in the treatment of intoxications due to hexavalent
chromium, but there is the difference in the therapeutic effects of the chelating
agents owing to the time intervals after the administration of the metal.

Stable isotopic tracers of lead mobilized by DMSA chelation in low lead-exposed
rats.

Smith DR(1), Flegal AR.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz 95064.

The ability of DMSA to mobilize skeletal lead or effect a redistribution of
endogenous lead to other target organs in low lead-exposed organisms is unclear. 
Discrepant results of past studies of DMSA and other lead chelators (e.g.,
CaNa2EDTA) may be due, in part, to experimental differences and difficulties in
distinguishing mobilized skeletal lead from other endogenous or exogenous lead
sources. Therefore, the influence of DMSA on the mobilization and redistribution 
of lead in skeletal and soft tissue compartments of low lead-exposed female
Wistar (115-125 g) rats was investigated using ultraclean stable lead isotope
tracer techniques. Rats that had been reared on a low lead-level diet (lead
intake approximately 80 ng Pb/g body/day) were fed 206Pb-enriched drinking water 
(210 ng Pb/ml) for 1.5 days and then were chelated with a single ip injection of 
a 0.11 mmol/kg dose of DMSA. Blood, kidney, brain, tibia, urine and feces were
collected 24 hr after chelation and analyzed for lead concentrations by graphite 
furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and for lead isotopic compositions by
thermal ionization mass spectrometry. These analyses demonstrated that DMSA
chelation significantly increased (15-fold) the diuresis of labile soft tissue
lead, but not skeletal lead. DMSA also appeared to effect a redistribution and
input of a comparable amount of lead to the skeleton and smaller relative amounts
of lead to the soft tissues (blood, kidney) of the chelated animals. The clinical
significance of these latter observations beyond the context of this preliminary 
study is not clear.

Current management of duplex-system ureteroceles: experience with 41 patients.

Rickwood AM(1), Reiner I, Jones M, Pournaras C.

Author information: 
(1)Regional Department of Paediatric Urology, Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital
Alder Hey.

Experience is described of 41 infants and children with duplex-system
ureteroceles, 25 presenting clinically and 16 by prenatal ultrasonography.
Bladder outflow obstruction was rare but lower polar vesicoureteric reflux (VUR),
usually of lesser grades, was common. Upper polar function, as assessed by
99mTc-DMSA, was negligible in children with truly ectopic ureteroceles but well
preserved in those where the lesion lay wholly intravesically. Lower polar
function was good, even in the presence of secondary obstruction, except in 2
infants with major VUR. Twenty-three patients were treated by upper polar
nephrectomy plus aspiration of the ureterocele; 2 subsequently required
ureterocele excision. Histology of excised specimens indicated that a more
conservative approach would not have been rewarded. Where upper polar function
was good, conservation was maintained in 3 cases by pyelopyelostomy and in 5 more
by excision of the ureterocele plus bipolar ureteric reimplantation. Other
operative strategies were employed in 2 cases. Finally, a defined group of 8
children was managed expectantly without untoward results. It was concluded that 
the variable anatomy and function associated with duplex-system ureteroceles
require a flexibile approach to treatment, including, possibly, no treatment at
all.

Tumor scintigraphy with 67Ga-citrate, 99mTc(V)-DMSA and 99mTc-MDP were performed 
on a patient with rare primary pulmonary leiomyosarcoma. While 67Ga-citrate
accumulation to the tumor was not recognized, 99mTc(V)-DMSA and 99mTc-MDP
scintigraphy showed relatively intense localization of the tracers in the lesion,
and were very useful in suggesting the characteristics of the tumor.

Characterization of gold in urine and bile following administration of gold
sodium thiomalate with chelating agents to rats.

Kojima S(1), Takahashi Y, Kiyozumi M, Funakoshi T, Shimada H.

Author information:

University, Japan.

Gold was characterized in the urine and bile of rats treated with D-penicillamine
(D-PEN), 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 2,3-dimercaptopropane sulphonate
(DMPS), or N-(2-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl)-L-cysteine (bucillamine) immediately 
after gold sodium thiomalate (AuTM) injection by both gel chromatographic and
electrophoretic methods. It is suggested that the gold in the urine and bile
after AuTM administration was predominantly bound to high molecular weight
compounds. The characterization of gold in the urine after administration of AuTM
with D-PEN, DMSA, or DMPS showed that most of the gold was bound to the chelating
agents. In the treatment with the chelating agents such as D-PEN and DMPS, the
gold was mainly excreted as a gold-chelating agent compound in the bile and a
minor portion of the gold was present in the form of a gold-L-cysteine compound
and high molecular weight compounds. DMSA treatment showed that a major portion
of the gold was bound to high molecular weight compounds in the bile and a minor 
portion of the gold was present in the forms of gold-DMSA and gold-L-cysteine
compounds. The administration of AuTM and bucillamine indicated that the gold was
mainly present as a gold-Me-bucillamine compound in the urine and a
gold-bucillamine compound in the bile.

Comment in
    Pediatr Nephrol. 1993 Oct;7(5):591-2.

Seventy-two children, 59 girls and 13 boys, 0.1-15.9 (median 1.1) years of age,
with acute pyelonephritis (APN) were investigated with the aid of a
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, renal ultrasonography (US) and a
desmopressin test within 5 days of admission. Sixty-two children were
reinvestigated approximately 2 months later when intravenous urography (IVU) and 
micturition cysto-urethrography were also performed. During infection, 92% of the
children showed changes in the DMSA scan with 69% by US, and the two
investigations agreed in 58% of the kidneys. At follow-up, 68% showed changes in 
the DMSA scan, 47% by US and 48% by IVU. The DMSA scan and IVU agreed in 60% of
the kidneys. Twenty-nine percent of the children had vesico-ureteric reflux
(VUR). The presence of grade greater than or equal to 3 VUR was associated with
greater defects on the DMSA scan during infection, and at follow-up with a higher
frequency of persistent changes compared with no VUR (P less than 0.02 and 0.01, 
respectively). During infection the size of the defect on the DMSA scan
correlated with renal volume and C-reactive protein and inversely with the
glomerular filtration rate, and at follow-up it correlated inversely with the
renal concentration capacity. The DMSA scan is a sensitive method for diagnosing 
and localizing APN in children, and findings on DMSA scan show a weak but
significant correlation with routine clinical and radiological parameters. It is 
suggested that persistent renal damage after APN in children without VUR may be
more common than previously assumed.

Involvement of the renal parenchyma in acute urinary tract infection: the
contribution of 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid scan.

Melis K(1), Vandevivere J, Hoskens C, Vervaet A, Sand A, Van Acker KJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatrics and Radiology, Children's Hospital Antwerp, Belgium.

We performed 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and ultrasonography in 146
children during the acute phase of a proven urinary tract infection (UTI). In 99 
a micturating cysto-urethrography and in 83 an intravenous urography was also
done. The occurrence of fever and increased WBC count, CRP and ESR were also
studied. It appeared from this retrospective study that 47% of the kidneys had a 
cortical or patchy pattern of decreased uptake of 99mTc DMSA, as compared to 23% 
with abnormal findings on US. Vesico-ureteral reflux was present in 38% of the
kidneys with parenchymal involvement on 99mTc DMSA scan. Although fever,
leucocytosis and elevated CRP and ESR were significantly correlated with abnormal
99mTc DMSA scan, they were also observed in children without renal parenchymal
involvement. Our results suggest that 99mTc DMSA scan is a sensitive method for
the detection of parenchymal involvement during acute UTI. The exact nature of
these lesions and their relation with scars need, however, to be defined.

We have tried to evaluate the usefulness of an early 99Tcm-MAG3 image, obtained
during the second minute after injection of the tracer, in predicting the renal
alterations seen on a 99Tcm-DMSA scintigraph, in children clinically suspected of
pyelonephritis. It appears that the accuracy of the MAG3 image is population
dependent: when, in most of the patients of a study group, DMSA scintigraphy is
either normal or very abnormal, the MAG3 image will correctly reflect the DMSA
scintigraph. However, when the DMSA alterations are less pronounced, the early
MAG3 image will miss the lesions in about 50% of the cases.

Measurement of kidney depths using computed axial tomographic (CAT) scans,
considered as the gold standard, has been compared in 25 patients with depth
measured using an isotopic method (99Tcm-DMSA). 99Tcm-DMSA underestimates renal
depth in 78% of the cases (mean underestimation: 0.78 cm). The correlation
coefficient between the two methods is 0.82. As a comparison, kidney depths
calculated using Tonnesen's formula are also given and related to CAT scan
results. The presence of renal morphological abnormalities in 18% of the studied 
kidneys allowed the authors to study their potential influence on 99TcmDMSA
measurements. They do not seem to be very different from those obtained in
morphologically normal kidneys. The different methods for kidney depth
measurement described in the literature are briefly reviewed.

Monoisoamyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate: interaction with metallothionein-bound

vivo.

Author information: 
(1)Ralph H. Johnson Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Charleston,
South Carolina 29401.

Monoisoamyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate (Mi-ADMS) and the unesterified
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were evaluated for relative reactivities
against metallothionein (MT)-bound cadmium (Cd) in vitro by elution of the
reaction products through Sephadex G-75 gel. After 3 hr of incubation, Mi-ADMS
removed about 70% of the Cd from Cd-MT, and a new peak emerged which corresponded
to that obtained by elution of a 2:1 molar mixture of Mi-ADMS and Cd. Only about 
15% of the Cd was removed from Cd-MT by DMSA. After 24 hr of incubation with
Mi-ADMS, no evidence remained of the presence of Cd-MT; all of the Cd was
recovered in a very high molecular weight fraction and in a fraction
corresponding to Cd ion. In contrast, after 24 hr of incubation with DMSA, 25% of
the Cd was still present as Cd-MT, while the remainder eluted in a fraction
corresponding to a 2:1 molar complex of DMSA and Cd. When Mi-ADMS was
administered to Cd-bearing mice which had received an inhibitor of organic anion 
transport, probenecid (PBC) or sulfinpyrazone (SPZ), prior to administration of
the monoester, there was a marked attenuation of the Cd mobilizing actions of
Mi-ADMS as reflected in whole body Cd levels. Analysis of organ Cd concentrations
revealed that PBC blocked primarily the mobilization of renal Cd by Mi-ADMS,
while the principal action of SPZ in antagonizing the action of Mi-ADMS was on
hepatic Cd mobilization. It was concluded that Mi-ADMS has a higher affinity for 
Cd in Cd-MT than does DMSA, and that the access of Mi-ADMS to intracellular Cd
is, at least in part, mediated by the organic anion transport system.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to high-dose (0.5%) lead acetate for
periods ranging from 1 to 9 months; then lead exposure was discontinued, and
animals were sacrificed after 12 months. Controls were pair-fed. Two additional
groups of low-dose (0.01%) and high-dose (0.5%) rats were exposed to lead for 6
months, then lead was discontinued and the rats were treated with three 5-day
courses of 0.5% DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) over the next 6 months. Controls
were rats exposed to lead for 6 months, then removed from exposure for 6 months
without receiving DMSA. Low-dose lead-treated rats showed no significant
pathological changes with or without DMSA treatment, but exhibited a significant 
increase in GFR after DMSA. High-dose lead-treated animals showed no functional
or pathological changes when lead exposure was discontinued after 1 month.
However, when duration of exposure was 6 or 9 months, GFR was decreased and serum
creatinine and urea nitrogen were increased as compared to controls.
Tubulointerstitial disease was severe. Administration of DMSA resulted in an
improvement in GFR and a decrease in albuminuria, together with a reduction in
size and number of nuclear inclusion bodies in proximal tubules. However,
tubulointerstitial scarring was only minimally reduced. It may be concluded that,
except for brief initial exposure, discontinuation of high-dose lead exposure
fails to reverse lead-induced renal damage. Treatment with the chelator, DMSA,
improves renal function but has less effect on pathological alterations. As GFR
improved after DMSA treatment in both low-dose and high-dose lead-treated rats,
irrespective of the degree of pathological alterations, it may be concluded that 
the DMSA effect is most likely mediated by hemodynamic changes.

The effect of the dithiols British Anti-Kewisite (BAL), dimercaptopropanesulfonic
acid (DMPS), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and a new metal binding agent
2,3-bis-(acetylthio)- propanesulfonamide (BAPSA) on the biliary excretion of
arsenic in perfused livers of guinea pigs after acute experimental poisoning with
As2O3 was investigated. Guinea pigs received As2O3, 10.0 mg/kg subcutaneously at 
9 a.m. as a single injection. One hour after the injection the livers were
perfused (2.5 ml x min.-1 x g-1 liver) with Krebs-Henseleit buffer and glucose
for 80 min. After 40 min. of saline perfusion (control) 0.1 or 0.7 mmol/l BAL,
DMSA, DMPS, or BAPSA were added to the perfusate and arsenic elimination in the
bile and effluent perfusate was measured. The biliary excretion of arsenic in
control livers between 40 and 80 min. was 0.7% of the total arsenic liver content
before perfusion (= arsenic liver content after perfusion + portion excreted in
the bile+perfusate). After antidote addition (0.1 mmol/l) the excretion was 0.2% 
for livers perfused with BAL, 6.8% for DMSA, 10.6% for DMPS, and 11.1% for BAPSA,
respectively. After 0.7 mmol/l antidote the excretion of arsenic was 0.1% in
livers perfused with BAL, 9.6% for DMSA, 12.3% for DMPS, and 13.3% for BAPSA,
respectively. Except BAL, all compounds and most effectively BAPSA increased
biliary excretion of arsenic. This indicates that excretion of arsenic which
normally is mainly renal is shifted towards faecal excretion by the dithiols.

Development of a therapeutic procedure for bismuth intoxication with chelating
agents.

Slikkerveer A(1), Jong HB, Helmich RB, de Wolff FA.

(1)Toxicology Laboratory, University Hospital Leiden, The Netherlands.

Although bismuth poisoning is still a rare phenomenon, the increasing use of
bismuth-containing drugs warrants a systematic approach to the treatment of
bismuth overdose. An effective method of enhancing the elimination of toxic
amounts of bismuth from the body has not been reported. Therefore we performed a 
study to select the best chelator to treat bismuth poisoning. Dimercaprol (BAL), 
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), D,L-2,3-dimercapto-propane-I-sulfonic
acid (DMPS), D-penicillamine (D-PEN), N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine (Ac-PEN),
thiopronine (TP), sodium-calcium edetate (EDTA) and deferoxamine (DFO) were
tested with an in vitro model of equilibrium dialysis and an in vivo model of
rats poisoned with bismuth. The rats (n = 6 per substance tested) were treated
with the chelators in intraperitoneal doses of 250 mumol/kg.day for 3 consecutive
days. Afterward, tissue and blood samples were collected. Bismuth concentrations 
were determined with electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry in serum,
buffer, urine, blood, brain, kidney, liver, spleen, and bone. Using in vitro
results, we constructed a ranking of chelating agents; it appeared not to predict
the in vivo results. The dithiol compounds (DMPS, DMSA and BAL) were effective in
most organs (especially in kidney and liver) resulting in a higher elimination of
bismuth in urine by DMPS and BAL. BAL was the only chelator effective in lowering
brain bismuth concentrations, whereas treatment with EDTA resulted in increased
brain bismuth levels. For D-PEN and DFO, no effects could be demonstrated. For
clinical practice, DMSA and DMPS may well be the chelators of choice; the
application of BAL should be reserved for very severe cases of poisoning because 
of its own toxicity.

Elemental mercury vapour toxicity, treatment, and prognosis after acute,

neuropsychological findings and chelator effects.

Mercury poisoning occurred after the acute, prolonged exposure of 53 construction
workers to elemental mercury. Of those exposed, 26 were evaluated by clinical
examination and tests of neuropsychological function. Patients received treatment
with chelation therapy in the first weeks after exposure. Eleven of the patients 
with the highest mercury levels were followed in detail over an extended period. 
Observations included the evaluation of subjective symptoms of distress, using
the 'Symptom Check List 90-Revised' (SCL-90R) and tests of visual-motor function 
such as 'Trailmaking Parts A and B', 'Finger Tapping', 'Stroop Colour Word Test' 
and 'Grooved Pegboard.' On day 85 +/- 11 (mean +/- s.d.) after exposure, these 11
men again received either 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or N-acetyl-D,
L-penicillamine (NAP) in a short-term study designed to compare the potential to 
mobilize mercury and the incidence of drug-induced toxicity of these two
chelating agents. Rapidly resolving metal fume fever was the earliest
manifestation of symptoms. CNS symptoms and abnormal performance on
neuropsychological tests persisted over the prolonged period of follow-up. There 
were significant correlations between neuropsychological tests and indices of
mercury exposure. Serial mercury in the blood and urine verified the long
half-life and large volume of distribution of mercury. Chelation therapy with
both drugs resulted in the mobilization of a small fraction of the total
estimated body mercury. However, DMSA was able to increase the excretion of
mercury to a greater extent than NAP. These observations demonstrate that acute
exposure to elemental mercury and its vapour induces acute, inorganic mercury
toxicity and causes long-term, probably irreversible, neurological sequelae.

The properties of 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3), a new radiopharmaceutic 
for dynamic renal scintigraphy, were assessed in a series of 138 patients with
different diseases of the uropoietic system. The physiological values of
renographic curves were determined as well as the characteristics of MAG3
excretion, which closely resembled the values for 131I-OIH. On comparing the
values of separate MAG3 clearance with standard radiopharmaceutics in 26 subjects
examined, very good correlation coefficients (r) were obtained: 0.98, 0.96, and
0.92 for 131I-OIH, 99mTc-DMSA, and 99mTc-DTPA, respectively. Global MAG3
clearance reached 0.64 of the OIH value. The higher quality of scinfigraphic
imaging than seen with the substances used so far, the favorable pharmacokinetic 
properties and the low radiation load (H(E) = 0.51 mSv in adults) of MAG3
determine the indication spheres in which it can best be used to advantage. Of
the radiopharmaceutics used to date, MAG3 yields the best results. It can well
substitute 123I-OIH, which is not readily available in our conditions, and can
thus be expected to be widely used in clinical practice.

Erratum in
    J Urol 1992 Sep;148(3):898.

99mTechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy is the imaging modality
of choice for the detection of acute pyelonephritis and chronic renal scarring in
children. Using the DMSA scan we prospectively evaluated renal scarring after
reflux and nonreflux pyelonephritis in children. The study population consisted
of 33 patients with acute pyelonephritis documented by a DMSA renal scan at
infection. The children were evaluated for renal scarring with a followup DMSA
scan 4 to 42 months (mean 10.7 months) after the acute infection. All new
scarring on followup DMSA scans occurred at sites corresponding exactly to areas 
of acute inflammation on the initial DMSA scan. Therefore, only those kidneys
with acute changes on the initial scan were subsequently analyzed. Of 38 kidneys 
new or progressive scarring developed in 16 (42%), including 6 of 15 (40%) with
associated vesicoureteral reflux and 10 of 23 (43%) without demonstrable reflux. 
New renal scarring developed in 6 of the 7 kidneys (86%) associated with a
neuropathic bladder or posterior urethral valves. In contrast, new scarring
developed in only 10 of 31 kidneys (32%) associated with a normal bladder (p =
0.028). Excluding the kidneys associated with a neuropathic bladder or posterior 
urethral valves, new renal scarring developed in 3 of 12 (25%) with primary
reflux, compared with 7 of 19 (37%) without vesicoureteral reflux. Except for the
white blood count and the species of infecting bacteria, no other statistically
significant differences could be found between those cases in which scars did or 
did not develop. We conclude that acquired renal scarring only occurs at sites
corresponding to previous areas of acute pyelonephritis, the acute parenchymal
inflammatory changes of acute pyelonephritis are reversible and do not lead to
new renal scarring in the majority of cases, and once acute pyelonephritis has
occurred ultimate renal scarring is independent of the presence or absence of
vesicoureteral reflux.

Protective effects of thiol compounds on chromate-induced cytotoxicity in HeLa
cells.

Susa N(1), Ueno S, Furukawa Y.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Veterinary Public Health, School of Veterinary Medicine and
Animal Sciences, Kitasato University, Towada, Japan.

The effects of several thiol compounds on the cytotoxicity induced by chromate
(potassium dichromate) were examined. HeLa cells were incubated in Eagle's
minimum essential medium (MEM) with or without the chromate alone, or with both
chromate and any one of L-cysteine ethyl ester (LCysEE), L-cysteine methyl ester 
(LCysME), N-acetyl-L-(+)-cysteine, 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 2,
3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), or dithiothreitol. After a given
period of incubation, the number of viable cells was counted using the trypan
blue exclusion test and the chromium content of the cells was estimated by atomic
absorption spectrophotometry. The results obtained were as follows. 1)
Chromate-induced cytotoxicity evaluated by inhibition of cell growth at 3 days of
incubation was diminished by all of the thiol compounds tested when the cells
were incubated in MEM with 2.5 to 10.0 microM chromate and 25 to 100 microM thiol
compounds. 2) All of the thiol compounds produced a concentration-dependent
reduction of chromate when a solution of the thiol compound (12.5 to 100 microM) 
was mixed with a solution of chromate (10 microM) in distilled water. 3) When
cells were incubated in MEM with both 10 microM chromate and 25 to 100 microM
thiol compounds, the chromium content of the cells at 6 hr of incubation was
decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. 4) When these thiol compounds were
added to MEM 1 hr before or after chromate, no or little protective effects of
these thiol compounds against chromate-induced cytotoxicity and chromium uptake
by the cells were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Compensatory hypertrophy effectively assesses the degree of impaired renal
function in unilateral renal disease.

O'Sullivan DC(1), Dewan PA, Guiney EJ.

Author information: 
(1)Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, Ireland.

A series of 66 children with unilateral renal disease and normal total renal
function were reviewed with the aim of determining whether clinically detectable 
compensatory hypertrophy indicated severe contralateral renal impairment. The
proportion of total renal function that was contributed by each kidney was
determined using isotope renography (99mTc-DTPA for 46 children, 99mTc-DMSA for
20). Kidney length was measured from plain abdominal radiographs or intravenous
urograms and hypertrophy was expressed as the renal size index (RSI). Of 37
kidneys with a RSI greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean, 36 had less 
than 15% of total function in the contralateral diseased kidney. Kidneys with
less than 10 or 15% of total renal function could be selected with 97 or 80%
sensitivity and 84 or 97% specificity, respectively, using the same RSI selection
level.

Vesicoureteric reflux and renal scars in asymptomatic siblings of children with
reflux.

Kenda RB(1), Fettich JJ.

Author information: 
(1)University Medical Centre, Municipal Children's Hospital, Ljubljana, Slovenia.

The purpose of the study was to determine the incidence of vesicoureteric reflux 
(VUR), renal scars and hypertension in asymptomatic siblings of children with
VUR. The study comprised 105 siblings of patients with VUR. Their age ranged from
4 months to 6.3 years. All had a direct radionuclide voiding cystography (DRVC)
performed, and VUR was detected in 47 of 105 (45%). High grade VUR in the first
year of life had an incidence of 50% compared with a 9% incidence in siblings
older than 2 years, while only one of the 27 siblings with a low VUR grade was
younger than 1 year. In 43 of 47 siblings with VUR, a technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scan was performed and renal scars were
found in 10, which presents 23% of siblings with VUR who were scanned and 10% of 
all siblings studied. One child had hypertension. Identifying VUR among
asymptomatic siblings could possibly prevent renal damage and its consequences.
Thus, the predictive value of positive family history alone in identifying VUR
was 45% while 23% of siblings had renal scars. This incidence justifies the
routine investigation of asymptomatic siblings, by using DRVC at an early stage.

Renal cortical scintigraphy in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis.

Majd M(1), Rushton HG.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC
20010.

Comparative clinical studies have shown renal cortical scintigraphy, using
technetium-99m (99mTc)-labeled glucoheptonate or dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 
to be significantly more sensitive than either intravenous pyelography or renal
sonography in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. However, due to
uncertainties about the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical and laboratory
parameters used in these studies, true sensitivity of renal cortical scintigraphy
was unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of [99mTc]DMSA scintigraphy in 
the diagnosis of experimentally induced acute pyelonephritis in piglets using
strict histopathologic criteria as the standard of reference. The sensitivity and
specificity of the DMSA scan for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis were 91%
and 99%, respectively, with an overall 97% agreement between the scintigraphic
and histopathologic findings. Based on the results of this experimental study, we
used the [99mTc]DMSA scan as the standard of reference for the diagnosis of acute
pyelonephritis, and conducted a prospective clinical study of 94 children
hospitalized with the diagnosis of acute febrile urinary tract infection (UTI).
The aims of this study were (1) to determine the relationship among
vesicoureteral reflux, P-fimbriated Escherichia coli, acute pyelonephritis, and
renal scarring, and (2) to evaluate the diagnostic reliability of the clinical
and laboratory parameters commonly used in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis.
We documented acute pyelonephritis in 62 (66%) of 94 patients. Vesicoureteral
reflux was demonstrated in 29 (31%) of the total group and in only 23 (37%) of 62
patients with acute pyelonephritis. The prevalence of P-fimbriae in the E coli
isolates was 64% in the patients with acute pyelonephritis and 78% in those with 
a normal DMSA scan. Even in patients without reflux, P-fimbriae were found in 71%
of isolates from the patients with acute pyelonephritis and in 75% of those with 
a normal renal scan. Follow-up DMSA scans were obtained in 33 patients with acute
pyelonephritis in 38 kidneys. We found complete resolution of the acute
inflammatory changes in 58% of the involved kidneys and renal scarring in the
remaining 42%, including 40% of the kidneys associated with reflux and 43% of
those without reflux.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Renal single photon emission computed tomography: should we do it?

Williams ED(1).

Author information: 
(1)Regional Medical Physics Department, District General Hospital, Sunderland,
UK.

Although single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has
established a place for itself in clinical nuclear medicine for heart and brain
studies, its place in renal imaging is not yet clear. Renal SPECT has been
subject to limitations imposed by the efficiency of imaging equipment, and has
been confined to use with static imaging agents such as technetium-99m (99mTc)
dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA). SPECT has been used to investigate space-occupying
lesions and anatomical abnormalities, and for quantitative studies of renal
uptake and volume. In these areas, it has provided little advantage over
conventional imaging, but it has been helpful in individual cases.
High-resolution SPECT is a promising new development, which may have applications
in detecting and classifying renal scarring. It deserves careful evaluation.

A series of 208 patients was prospectively assessed for reflux nephropathy by
intravenous urography (IVU) and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) scintigraphy.
All patients were studied at least 3 months after their most recent urinary tract
infection and micturating cystourethrography (MCU) was performed prior to the
scintigraphic studies. DMSA scintigraphy detected significantly more cortical
abnormalities than did IVU. There was also a correlation between cortical
abnormalities in the DMSA studies and the degree of reflux on MCU. The validity
of DMSA as a cortical imaging agent is evaluated and the histological evidence
for its efficacy derived from the animal model is reviewed, lending weight to its
establishment as the "gold standard" for renal cortical scarring.

The objective of our prospective study was to compare the sensitivity and
specificity of ultrasonography, intravenous pyelography, and dimercaptosuccinic
acid scan in detecting scarred kidneys. Twenty-seven consecutive subjects with
recurrent urinary tract infections, vesicoureteral reflux, scarred kidneys, or a 
combination of these problems had all three imaging procedures performed. With
the total number of scars serving as the gold standard, the sensitivity (94%) and
specificity (100%) in identifying renal scars in children were highest for the
DMSA scan. Intraobserver (95%) and interobserver (90%) reliability were also high
for the DMSA scan. However, the clinical interpretation of the increased
sensitivity of the DMSA scan is unknown. Changes on the scan not identified by
intravenous urography may not represent true scars. Research into the long-term
significance of these scars is indicated.

By examination of 331 patients, using 99mTc-DMSA, the authors confirmed that
static scintigraphy is an accurate method for assessment of the separate renal
function. In four groups of patients with different positions of the kidneys the 
authors proved that correction for different absorption of gamma radiation from
the left and right kidney is essential. Without correction results with a
significant error are obtained, in particular in patients with an asymmetric
position of the kidneys, where the results calculated without correction cannot
be used for clinical purposes. The results are not influenced by the time
interval between administration of the radiopharmaceutical preparation and
examinations within an interval of 2 to 4 hours, with the exception of patients
with severe obstructive uropathy. For assessment of the relative function of the 
kidneys it is better to examine the patient in a vertical position. The
reproducibility of results in repeated examinations and repeated evaluation is
excellent.

Tc-99m(V) DMSA imaging. A new approach to studying metastases from breast
carcinoma.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied
Sciences, New Delhi, India.

Combined Tc-99m MDP skeletal imaging and Tc-99m(V) DMSA whole body scans to
detect metastases were performed during the follow-up of 30 patients who
underwent surgery for breast carcinoma. Eight patients had normal Tc-99m MDP and 
Tc-99m(V) DMSA scans and were declared free of metastatic disease, further
confirmed by no change in symptomatology over a 1-year follow-up period.
Twenty-two patients had positive Tc-99m MDP scans with varied skeletal
involvement. Tc-99m(V) DMSA scans showed matched areas of increased radiotracer
concentration in bony metastases in 20 of these patients. Tc-99m(V) DMSA
concentration was not seen in traumatic vertebral collapse or in coexistent
osteoarthritic disease in vertebral metastatic involvement. Interestingly,
Tc-99m(V) DMSA showed increased concentration in brain and liver metastases.
Pentavalent Tc-99m(V) DMSA appears useful for detecting skeletal and soft-tissue 
metastases in breast carcinoma, and can improve the specificity of Tc-99m MDP
bone scans in screening for bone metastases.

99Tcm-mercapto acetyl triglycine in paediatric renal tract disease.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Freedom Fields Hospital, Plymouth.

The use of 99Tcm-mercapto acetyl triglycine (99Tcm-MAG3), a new hippuran
substitute, has been reported widely in adults but not in children. Our
experience of its use in 100 infants and children for renography and indirect
micturating cystography (IMC) is reported. The average age was 5.6 years. 65
patients completed IMC studies and nine patients had 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (99Tcm-DMSA) scans performed on the same day. The majority of patients were 
referred for the investigation of urinary tract infection. 32 kidneys were found 
to be scarred on 99Tcm-MAG3 scans, 17 kidneys and ureters refluxed on IMC and 14 
kidneys were obstructed. The results of 99Tcm-MAG3 scans were compared with those
of other urinary tract investigations including ultrasound, micturating
cystography (MCUG), intravenous urography (IVU) and 99Tcm-DMSA scintigraphy. No
kidney which was scarred had a normal 99Tcm-MAG3 scan. All significant degrees of
dilatation or obstruction on IVU or ultrasound were also detected by 99Tcm-MAG3. 
99Tcm-MAG3 gave more information than any other single imaging modality and we
believe it represents an ideal initial screening test in the investigation of
urinary tract infection in older toilet-trained children.

Determination of functional kidney volume by single-photon emission computed
tomography in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

Functional parenchymal kidney volume was determined by single-photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT) for 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) using a
rotating gamma camera in phantom experiments and in patients with
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The results from the patient
examinations were corrected according to the phantom studies and were thereafter 
set in relation to renal haemodynamics, blood pressure, and urinary albumin
excretion. Functional parenchymal kidney volume was significantly greater in
diabetic patients compared to that of 11 healthy controls (P < 0.003). Urinary
albumin excretion was increased and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) per renal
parenchymal volume significantly less in patients with a duration of diabetic
disease of more than 15 years compared to patients with shorter duration of
disease (P < 0.03 and P < 0.05 respectively). Diabetic patients with a GFR of
more than 120 ml/min had greater renal parenchymal volume than patients with
lower GFR (P < 0.02). Patients with increased GFR, renal plasma flow (RPF), renal
blood flow, or filtration fraction had significantly greater functional
parenchymal volume than the healthy subjects (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). We
conclude that by application of SPECT for DMSA we were able to show that IDDM
patients have greater renal parenchymal volumes than healthy subjects. GFR/kidney
volume was increased in IDDM patients with a duration of disease of < 15 years
compared to patients with long-standing diabetes. The SPECT technique seems
suitable for prospective long-term follow-up studies of functional kidney volume 
in IDDM patients.

Using technetium-99m (V) dimercaptosuccinic acid to detect malignancies from
single solid masses in the lungs.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan,
Republic of China.

Fifty patients (43 male, 7 female, age 31-77 years) with single solid masses in
their lungs based on the findings of a chest X-radiograph [40 malignancies: 5
small cell carcinoma (Ca), 17 epidermoid Ca, 12 adeno Ca, 6 undifferentiated
large cell Ca] and 10 benign lesions underwent technetium-99m (V)
dimercaptosuccinic acid [99m-(V)DMSA] scans to evaluate the usefulness of
99mTc-(V)DMSA in the detection of lung Ca with different cell types and benign
lesions. Only 43% (17/40) of the malignancies in the lungs were detected by
99mTc-(V)DMSA, including 29% (5/17) epidermoid Ca, 50% (6/12) adeno Ca and 17%
(1/6) undifferentiated large cell Ca of the lungs. However, all 5 cases of small 
cell Ca and 11 cases combined with bone metastasis were revealed by
99mTc-(V)DMSA. In addition, 3 of the 10 benign lesions (2 organizing pneumonias, 
1 benign tumor) presented with an uptake of 99mTc-(V)DMSA. The diagnostic
sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 43%, 70% and 48%, respectively, in
differentiating malignant from benign lesions for the single solid mass in the
lungs. In conclusion, 99mTc-(V)DMSA is of little or no use in the differentiation
of lung Ca from single solid masses in the lungs.

Color Doppler sonography in pyelonephritis.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State 
University, Hershey 17033.

Renal sonography detects abnormality in only 40% of pediatric pyelonephritis. In 
eight patients shown to have acute pyelonephritis by 99mTc DMSA renal cortical
scintigraphy, five were found to have focal abnormalities of renal perfusion by
color Doppler sonography in the same sites as the scintigraphic defects
(sensitivity-63%). Two of the five patients had normal plain sonograms. False
positive studies occurred in patients with documented chronic renal scarring. The
specificity of vascular asymmetry was 70%. This preliminary report suggests that,
particularly in the patient without pre-existing renal scarring, color Doppler
evaluation of the renal vasculature may increase the sensitivity of sonography in
the diagnosis of pyelonephritis in children.

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is bound to plasma albumin in humans and 
appears to be excreted in the urine as the DMSA-cysteine mixed disulfide. The
pharmacokinetics of DMSA have been determined after its administration to humans 
po. For the blood, the tmax and t1/2 were 3.0 h + 0.45 SE and 3.2 h + 0.56 SE,
respectively. The Cmax was 26.2 microM + 4.7 SE. To determine whether dental
amalgams influence the human body burden of mercury, we gave volunteers the
sodium salt of 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS). The diameters of
dental amalgams of the subjects were determined to obtain the amalgam score.
Administration of 300 mg DMPS by mouth increased the mean urinary mercury
excretion of subjects over a 9 h period. There was a positive correlation between
the amount of mercury excreted and the amalgam score. DMPS might be useful for
increasing the urinary excretion of mercury and thus increasing the significance 
and reliability of this measure of mercury exposure. DMSA analogs have been
designed and synthesized in attempts to increase the uptake by cell membranes of 
the DMSA prototype chelating agents. The i.v. administration of the monomethyl
ester of DMSA, the dimethyl ester of DMSA or the zinc chelate of dimethyl DMSA
increases the biliary excretion of platinum and cadmium in rats.

Technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid and dimercaptosuccinic acid

We present a case in which a 39-year-old woman with correctable bilateral
renovascular hypertension did not show abnormality during post-captopril
technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) study. Post-captopril
99mTc-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) scintigraphy revealed the
adverse effect of a stenosis of the artery supplying the upper part of her left
kidney but failed to uncover the existence of severe multiple narrowings of the
right renal artery. After bilateral renovascular reconstructive surgery, the
hypertension completely disappeared. This case illustrates that DTPA may be more 
efficacious than DMSA in the detection of segmental loss of renal function
induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) affects maternal and fetal copper
metabolism in Swiss mice.

Taubeneck MW(1), Domingo JL, Llobet JM, Keen CL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nutrition, University of California, Davis 95616.

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a chelating agent used to treat heavy 
metal intoxication. DMSA has been reported to be teratogenic in the mouse, and it
has been suggested that this teratogenicity may be secondary to DMSA-induced
alterations in Zn metabolism. In the present study, 0, 400 or 800 mg DMSA/kg body
weight were administered on gestation days 6-15 to pregnant Swiss mice by gavage 
(PO) or subcutaneous injection (SC). Mice were fed a diet containing 14
micrograms Zn, 10 micrograms Cu, 120 micrograms Fe, 1175 micrograms Mg and 6.8 mg
Ca/g diet. A sub-group of mice in the 800 mg DMSA/kg SC group was fed a diet
containing 250 micrograms Zn/g. DMSA administration did not result in overt
maternal toxicity. There was no effect of the drug on fetal or placental weight, 
or on crown-rump length. However, some fetuses from DMSA-treated dams were
characterized by skeletal abnormalities including supernumerary ribs, unossified 
anterior phalanges and malformed sternebrae. Drug exposure was not associated
with consistent changes in tissue Zn, Fe, Ca or Mg levels. Supplemental Zn had no
marked effects on the fetus. Fetal liver Cu concentrations exhibited
dose-dependent decreases with increasing DMSA dose. This finding suggests that
the developmental toxicity of DMSA may be mediated through disturbed
maternal/fetal copper metabolism.

Vesico-ureteric reflux in the damaged non-scarred kidney.

Stutley JE(1), Gordon I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Hospital for Sick Children, London, UK.

Renal damage without scarring is a rare manifestation of reflux nephropathy, and 
is infrequently reported in the literature. A retrospective review of a large
series of patients with urinary tract disorders at the hospital for Sick
Children, Great Ormond Street, identified 12 patients with vesico-ureteric reflux
(VUR) with no evidence of scarring but with renal damage as assessed using
technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scan. There were 9 simplex
kidneys, the differential function was between 33% and 43% (mean 38%). On
follow-up to date (mean 6.7 years) all kidneys show stable differential function 
with neither improvement nor deterioration. Only 8 children had a urinary tract
infection. Renal damage without evidence of a focal scar associated with VUR may 
be a manifestation of growth arrest possibly due to glomerular damage. The
sensitivity of 99mTc-DMSA may reveal the permanent nature of the renal damage.

Controlled study of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid for the management of
childhood lead intoxication.

Surgeons, New York, New York.

We examined the efficacy and safety of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in
children with markedly elevated blood lead (BPb) concentrations. Among 19
children with BPb concentrations of 50 to 69 micrograms/dl (2.41 to 3.33 mumol/L)
who received a 5-day inpatient oral course of DMSA (1050 mg/m2 per day), the mean
BPb concentration decreased by 61%; in four who received calcium disodium
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CaNa2EDTA) (1000 mg/m2 per day intravenously),
it decreased by 45% (p less than 0.0007). Urinary lead excretion was comparable
in both groups. Treatment with DMSA was more effective than treatment with
CaNa2EDTA in restoring metabolic activity to the heme pathway and was well
tolerated even among nine patients who received concomitant iron supplementation 
and two who had homozygous deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. On
discharge, these 19 children received either no chelation therapy or DMSA, 350 or
700 mg/m2 per day for 14 days on an outpatient basis. After 14 days the mean BPb 
values for the no-chelation, low-DMSA, and high-DMSA groups were 73%, 66%, and
50% of the pretreatment values, respectively. We conclude that a 5-day oral
course of DMSA is effective in the treatment of children with severe lead
poisoning. In addition, on an outpatient basis the administration of DMSA, 700
mg/m2 per day, is capable of delaying the typical rebound in BPb values and
should ultimately reduce the need for repeated hospitalizations.

meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) treatment in free of
liposome-encapsulated form was given to mice pre-exposed to cadmium as CdCl2 (2
intraperitoneal injections; 0.5 mg Cd/kg along with 5 microCi 109CdCl2 in 4 ml
volume within 24 h). Both treatments removed cadmium from liver, spleen, testis
and blood with liposomal DMSA exhibiting higher efficacy in mobilizing cadmium
not only from whole organs but also from liver proteins. It also resulted in
higher excretion of cadmium via urine as compared with free DMSA or saline
treatment. Whereas this treatment eliminated significantly higher amounts of
cadmium via the fecal route throughout the period examined, free DMSA responded
only 48 h after treatment and was less effective. The results suggest
mobilization of cadmium from intracellular sites of deposition. However, DMSA in 
the dose administered (24 mumol/kg i.v.) in either form was ineffective in
decorporating cadmium from the kidney, the critical organ in cadmium
intoxication.

Effect of extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy shock waves on renal function

Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy has altered the therapeutic approach to
urinary stone disease. Recently, a method was developed in which shock-wave
generation is obtained piezoelectrically. To evaluate the effect of
extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy (EPL) on renal function, 20 patients
were studied prior to and after EPL of renal calculi. Renal cortical function was
evaluated by using a previously described and validated quantitative single
photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) method to measure individual
absolute uptake of technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99m-DMSA). Twenty
kidneys were treated, and the 19 contralateral kidneys were without stone disease
(1 patient had a single kidney). The absolute kidney uptake of Tc-DMSA in the
normal kidneys was 21.4% +/- 6.2% before and 22.2% +/- 6.4% after EPL. For the
treated kidneys the absolute update was 16.8% +/- 5.3% and 16.8% +/- 4.7% before 
and after, respectively. There was no statistical significant difference between 
pre- and post-treatment values. The absolute kidney uptake was significantly
lower (p less than 0.01) in the treated than in the normal kidneys. This study
indicates that the EPL procedure did not cause any damage to cortical function
detectable by the DMSA uptake.

minimally decreased. In this case, 99mTc-DMSA uptake did not correlate with
"global renal function," but rather with the functioning tubular mass.

Intravenous pyelography (IVP) is a common procedure in acute pyelonephritis
(APN). In fact, IVP is unable to show the extent of the renal tissue lesions. It 
only determines the patency of the urinary tract, thus ruling out secondary (i.e.
surgical) APN. Modern imaging comprises ultrasonography, CT scan with injection
of contrast medium, and cortical scintigraphy using GH or DMSA technetium. These 
investigations, used separately or in combination, are of considerable interest
in the diagnosis, treatment and follow up of acute infections of the upper
urinary tract. Such infections entail more severe sequelae (cortical scars) than 
previously thought.

Effect of four thiol-containing chelators on disposition of orally administered
mercuric chloride.

Nielsen JB(1), Andersen O.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Environmental Medicine, Odense University, Denmark.

Acute toxicity and the disposition of inorganic mercury depends on the route of
exposure. Most previous studies on effect of chelators on inorganic mercury
toxicity and toxicokinetics employed parenteral administration of both metal and 
chelator. However, the most prominent routes for human inorganic mercury exposure
are the oral or pulmonary. BAL was previously considered the drug of choice in
human intoxications with most heavy metals. This recommendation has been
questioned during recent years due to the advent of the less toxic hydrophilic
BAL analogues DMSA and DMPS. The present study, using oral administration of
HgCl2 labelled with 203Hg, demonstrates that DMPS is superior to the other
chelators in preventing mortality. Moreover, both DMSA and DMPS are superior to
BAL and NAPA in alleviating acute toxicity and in preventing the undesirable
distribution of orally administered mercury, especially to the brain. Further,
oral administration of these chelators were more efficient than parenteral
administration in reducing whole-body retention and organ deposition of orally
administered mercuric chloride, most likely due to the prevention of intestinal
uptake of mercury.

Phantom kidney: a CT correlation.

Mochizuki T(1), Charron M, Shah AN, Tauxe WN.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

The phantom kidney is a "kidney-like" apparition which may be seen in dynamic
renal scintigraphy typically in post-nephrectomy patients or in patients with
unilateral renal agenesis. We report a case of a phantom kidney demonstrated in
the angiographic phase of renal scintigraphy with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc-DMSA) in a patient who was nephrectomized 14 years previously. After
comparison with the CT images, we conclude that our patient's finding was caused 
by an increased mesenteric vascularity, possibly postprandial. Several conditions
which may cause the phantom kidney effect, have been reported, but increased
mesenteric vascularity seems to be the most common cause.

Imaging in urinary tract infection.

Gleeson FV(1), Gordon I.

Author information: 
(1)Imaging Department, Hospital for Sick Children, London.

The relationship of vesicoureteric reflex (VUR) and renal scarring was studied in
94 children (188 kidneys) with proved urinary tract infection in a district
general hospital. There were 61 girls and 33 boys, with nine girls and 17 boys
aged less than 1 year, 31 girls and nine boys aged between 1 and 5 years, the
remaining 28 children were over 5 years of age. All children had a micturating
cystourethrogram and a 99mTc (technetium) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan.
Forty two of the 188 kidneys were scarred and 70 of the kidneys had VUR. Only
37.1% of the kidneys with reflux were scarred but 61.9% of the scarred kidneys
had VUR. In children of less than 1 year, 48% of kidneys with VUR were scarred
whereas 70.6% of scarred kidneys had reflux. In children between 1 and 5 years of
age only 36.4% of kidneys with VUR were scarred but 63.2% of scarred kidneys had 
VUR. There is good correlation between the detection of a scarred kidney on DMSA 
and the presence of vesicoureteric reflux. However the detection of reflux
particularly in children over 1 year of age shows poor correlation with renal
scarring. This suggests that the primary imaging in children over 1 year of age
presenting with a urinary tract infection should be of the kidney: a cystogram
should be performed only if the DMSA scan is abnormal.

A neonate with infantile polycystic kidney disease underwent Tc-99m DMSA imaging.
The pattern of uptake in infantile polycystic disease is different from the
multiple cystic lesions reported in the literature for adult polycystic kidney
disease. The infantile pattern of uptake shows large kidneys with diffuse,
symmetric localization of the radiopharmaceutical, which seems to be
characteristic and may be pathognomonic of the disease process.

[Treatment of chronic occupational lead poisoning with dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA)].

[Article in Danish]

(1)Medicinsk afdeling C, Odense Universitet.

2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) mobilizes lead from superficial depots. In
comparison with other chelating agents, DMSA has a high therapeutic index and has
the additional advantage that it can be administered orally. We have used DMSA
for treatment of chronic occupational lead poisoning in a 54-year old male with
signs of neurotoxic effects. The treatment resulted in a rapid decrease in the
blood-lead concentration, followed by a slow increase after the treatment and
subsequent stabilization at a blood-lead level lower than prior to treatment.
During the first course of treatment, almost 100 mumols lead was excreted in the 
urine. As a result of successive courses of treatments, the patient's condition
was improved. However, during the third course of treatment, he developed a
mucocutaneous rash which faded again after withdrawal of DMSA; this reaction was 
subsequently provoked by sub-therapeutic doses, and continued treatment was
therefore cancelled. Only minor, reversible side effects of DMSA have hitherto
been reported, and DMSA must therefore be regarded a promising agent for
long-term, out-patient chelation treatment of chronic lead poisoning.

Value of 111indium leukocyte scanning in febrile organ transplant patients.

Author information:

of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington.

Immunosuppressed febrile organ transplant patients present a diagnostic and
therapeutic dilemma since symptomatology is often altered by immunosuppression,
which also masks the location of infection. Fifty 111indium leukocyte ( 111In
WBC) scans were performed to determine their usefulness in the organ transplant
patient. The results were compared with computerized tomography (CT) and gallium 
67-citrate (Ga) scanning. Eleven patients received both 111In WBC and Ga scans;
22 received both 111In WBC and CT scans. Ten 111In WBC scans had subtraction of
99m Tc sulfur or albumin colloid for liver evaluation and four 111In WBC scans
had subtraction of 99m Tc DMSA for kidney evaluation. The overall sensitivity and
specificity for 111In WBC scans was 90% and 90%, respectively. Lung uptake was
sensitive (89%) and specific (97%) for pulmonary infections, including bacterial,

(41%), all except 2 being due to rejection, pyelonephritis, urinary tract
infections, or cytomegalovirus infections. Pyelonephritis and renal abscesses
were diagnosed in 3 cases with 99m Tc DMSA subtraction. Perihepatic abscesses
(2), and infected liver cysts (4) were diagnosed with 99m Tc sulfur or albumin
colloid subtraction. There were five false-negative CT scans and three
false-negative Ga scans. Therefore, when compared with 111In: sensitivity = 88%

Role of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy in medullary thyroid carcinoma.

Hoefnagel CA(1), Delprat CC, Valdés Olmos RA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.

In recent years several radiopharmaceuticals have become available, offering new 
possibilities for the diagnosis and therapy of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).
For the diagnosis and follow-up 201TI-chloride and 99mTc(V)-DMSA are the tracers 
of choice. Imaging with [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) and
131I-anti-CEA or anti-calcitonin antibodies or fragments is less sensitive but
very specific. These tracers can be used to evaluate their potential therapeutic 
use. Cumulative reported data on the diagnostic use of 131I-MIBG in 178 MTC
patients indicate that overall 34.5% of medullary cancers concentrate MIBG. At
The Netherlands Cancer Institute 131I-MIBG scintigraphy was positive in 8 of 23
patients with MTC. Four of these patients have received therapeutic amounts of
131I-MIBG, resulting in 1 partial remission and meaningful palliation in 3
patients with metastatic MTC. It is concluded that, although the preliminary
experience suggests that the objective response of MTC to 131I-MIBG therapy is
limited, the palliation provided to these patients, for whom there is little
other treatment, may be very meaningful.

[Surveillance of renal function by scintigraphy with 99m Tc-DMSA after a
trans-ileal cutaneous ureterostomy].

[Article in French]

The renal function of sixty one adult patients was monitored by 99mTc-DMSA renal 
scan after cystectomy for a malignant tumour followed by ileal conduit urinary
diversion. The postoperative follow-up period was 10 years. The stenosis rate of 
the uretero-ileal anastomosis was 12.8% and the incidence of pyelonephritis was
8% The mean value for overall renal function and for the function of each kidney 
did not deteriorate significantly (p = 0.1 and p = 0.7, respectively) over time. 
However, 26% of kidneys evaluated at 1 year and at 5 years showed a markedly
decreased uptake on the renogram. In 70% of cases, this decreased uptake was
related to the development of stenosis of the uretero-ileal anastomosis or
pyelonephritis. Renal function remained stable at 5 years in group A,
corresponding to patients with good initial renal function (n = 22, p = 0.07),
and in group B, corresponding to patients with poor initial renal function (n =
7, p = 0.9). Similarly, the function of solitary kidneys did not deteriorate over
the 5-year postoperative follow-up period (n = 7, p = 0.5). The functional value 
of the kidneys was therefore not globally altered after ileal conduit urinary
diversion. The existence of a mechanical or infectious complication should be
systematically investigated in the presence of a deterioration in renal function.
DMSA isotope renal scan is a complete, qualitative and quantitative, follow-up
examination after this type of urinary diversion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

From 1984 to 1990, 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy was performed before and after
nephrolithotomy (15 cases), pyelolithotomy (15 cases), percutaneous
nephrolithotripsy (PNL: 15 cases) and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy
(ESWL: 16 cases, 17 kidneys) in order to evaluate of influences of renal stone
surgeries on split renal function. DMSA renal uptake change ratio of treated
kidneys of nephrolithotomy (-24.94 +/- 5.60%) was significantly lower than that
of PNL (-0.06 +/- 3.92%), pyelolithotomy (-4.08 +/- 4.79%) (p less than 0.01) and
ESWL (-7.72 +/- 3.87%) (p less than 0.05). The average change ratios of
contralateral kidneys were as follows: PNL 4.80 +/- 4.21% nephrolithotomy 4.67
+/- 4.73%, pyelolithotomy -1.46 +/- 5.39% and ESWL -2.02 +/- 4.44%. One to 3
weeks after PNL, the cold area on the renal image was found in 10 (66.7%) of 15
cases. In cases of ESWL, DMSA renal uptake decreased even 4-10 weeks (mean 7
weeks) after treatment. In conclusion, possivility of deterioration of renal
function after ESWL was suggested.

[The effect of pyeloplasty on renal function in children with unilateral
ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Investigation of the split renal function
using DMSA renal uptake rate].

[Article in Japanese]

Pre- and post-operative changes of renal function in twenty children (10 were
younger than 2 years old) with unilateral hydronephrosis due to ureteropelvic
junction obstruction were studied on the basis of DMSA renal uptake rate. A
marked increase in DMSA renal uptake rate was observed in thirteen cases (65%)
after pyeloplasty on the obstructed side. Among them eight children were younger 
than 2 years old. In 6 children younger than 2 years old, a remarkable increase
of DMSA renal uptake rate after reconstructive operation was recognized not only 
on the obstructed side but also on the contralateral normal side. These tendency 
could not be observed in those older than 2 years old. These results suggest
that, in the young children, the obstructed kidney inhibits the contralateral
normal and compensatory renal growth, and that the relief of obstruction
eliminates this inhibition and causes the renal growth spur in a normal kidney.
We conclude that it is essential to correct unilateral ureteropelvic junction
obstruction before two years of age if an improvement of renal function not only 
on the obstructed side but also on the normal side is to be expected.

Kidney involvement is one of the most frequent causes of death in progressive
systemic scleroderma (PSS). It is therefore important to detect potential
impairment of renal function in PSS very early. In 76 patients referred for
nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures, 42 pathologic results were found with
131I-hippurate clearance, while only 14 abnormal results were detected by static 
99mTc-DMSA scans. Hippurate clearance is thus a sensitive method of functional
renal evaluation in PSS.

Author information:

Technetium-99m (99Tcm) (V) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a new tumour imaging
agent that has been used to image squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and
neck. This study has been undertaken to compare clinical examination with
computed tomography (CT) (anatomical) and SPECT 99Tcm (V) DMSA (physiological)
imaging in the evaluation of metastatic SCC of the neck. Twenty-five patients
with head and neck cancer were studied. Computed tomography was as sensitive but 
more accurate than clinical examination in predicting the presence of cancer.
SPECT 99Tcm (V) DMSA was inferior to both techniques in identifying metastatic
disease. There is no role for SPECT 99Tcm (V) DMSA imaging in the management of
patients with SCC metastatic to the neck. Combined imaging with CT offered no
advantages over anatomical imaging with CT alone. There is no role for CT in the 
routine evaluation of the clinically N0 neck and the role of CT of the neck in
the management of patients with metastatic SCC is discussed.

Establishment, Gwalior, India.

The influence of zinc and copper supplementation during chelation therapy to
reduce zinc and copper imbalance and promote lead elimination from the body, was 
investigated in rats poisoned with lead. The simultaneous supplementation of zinc
and copper increased urinary lead excretion by calcium disodium ethylenediamine
tetraacetic acid (CaNa2EDTA) compared to treatment with CaNa2EDTA alone.
Combination therapy was effective in potentiating the depletion of blood and
renal lead by CaNa2EDTA and meso 2,3-dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA). Combination
therapy was also more effective in reducing hepatic lead by CaNa2EDTA and blood
lead by 2,3-dimercapto propane sulphonate (DMPS). Zinc and copper supplementation
produced a more effective reversal of inhibited blood delta-aminolevulinic acid
dehydratase (ALAD) activity, urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid excretion and
depleted body zinc and copper status.

In mice and rats given iv or im 63NiCl2 148-370 kBq, radioactivity was present in
highest concentrations in kidney, lung, and liver. After given ig
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) 1 g.kg-1, radioactivity decreased remarkably in
kidney, lung, and blood. The excretion of 63Ni via urine and feces within 24 h,
respectively 13.0 +/- 2.4% and 0.6 +/- 0.4%, was similar to that in the control
group in mice. But radioactivity increased markedly in bone. The Ni content of
bone decreased on d 7. In rats given im 63NiCl2 370 kBq, two different nickel
complex peaks appeared in the gel chromatograms of serum, kidney, and lung. DMSA 
reduced the contents of protein-bound Ni in serum, kidney, and lung. The results 
showed that DMSA detoxified the Ni by forming a low toxicity Ni-DMSA complex to
redistribute in the body.

Voiding cystourethrography (VCU) of 407 children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)
at our hospital during 1969-1990 was reviewed and 7 cases (8 ureters) of
intrarenal reflux (IRR) were found. All the children were male and had had an
episode of febrile urinary infection under one year of age. One child had a left 
flank mass, which was later proven a urinoma. VUR was moderate (grade III) in 3
and massive (grade IV and V) in 5. VUR was estimated as primary in one child and 
as secondary in 6 (anterior urethral ring 2, posterior urethral valve 2,
neurogenic bladder 2). IRR was localized to the upper area in 3, to the lower
area in 2, and to the whole kidney in 3. Sixty percent of those with IRR in the
polar areas was associated with moderate VUR, whereas all of those in the whole
kidney was with massive one. Renal scarring was assessed by excretory urography
(IVP) and/or 99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy. Seven kidneys were evaluable; polar
scars in 5, dwarf with polar scar in 1 and dwarf with poor function (suspected
hypodysplasia) in 1. In 4 kidneys new scar formation was observed. It was noted, 
however, that IRR did not necessarily accompany renal scars of the corresponding 
areas and IRR to the whole kidney did not always lead to multiple scars in the
whole kidney. The nature and problems of IRR, renal scars and 99mTc-DMSA
renoscintigraphy were discussed. It was suggested that urinary infection played a
greater part in renal scar formation.

A pentavalent 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was performed on a
patient with multiple myeloma without amyloidosis. A high accumulation of the
tracer was found in numerous tumors. We believe that the accumulation of DMSA is 
unrelated to amyloidosis and that the DMSA scan may have potential for the
staging of tumors in patients presenting with multiple myeloma.

Diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children: comparison of sonography and
99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy.

Center, Washington, DC 20010-2970.

Ninety-one children 1 week to 10 years old with culture-documented febrile
urinary tract infection were evaluated with renal sonography and renal cortical
scintigraphy by using 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). On the basis 
of previous experimental studies, DMSA scintigraphy was used as the standard of
reference for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. The DMSA scans showed
changes consistent with acute pyelonephritis in 63% (57/91) of the patients.
Sonograms showed changes consistent with acute pyelonephritis in 24% (22/91) of
the whole group and in only 39% (22/57) of the patients with scintigraphically
documented acute pyelonephritis. Pertinent sonographic findings were areas of
increased cortical echogenicity in 14 patients and decreased echogenicity in
eight, including three patients with renal abscesses. Dilatation of the renal
collecting system was noted in nine patients and renal enlargement was noted in
three. We conclude that renal sonography is a relatively insensitive test for the
detection of acute inflammatory changes of renal cortex. Therefore, it should not
be used as the primary imaging technique for the diagnosis of acute
pyelonephritis. However, sonography is a useful technique in evaluating the
nature of the defects seen on the DMSA scan and in detecting obstructive
uropathies that may be associated with urinary tract infections.

meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid and prevention of arsenite embryotoxicity and
teratogenicity in the mouse.

Domingo JL(1), Bosque MA, Piera V.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Toxicology and Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of
Barcelona, Reus, Spain.

meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), an antidote for the treatment of
experimental and human poisoning by a number of heavy metals, has been reported
to reduce the lethality of animals poisoned with arsenic more effectively than
2,3-dimercaptopropanol. In the present study, the effect of DMSA on
arsenite-induced embryotoxic and teratogenic effects was evaluated in mice. In a 
first experiment, a series of four DMSA injections was administered sc to
pregnant Swiss mice immediately after a single ip injection of 12 mg/kg of sodium
arsenite (NaAsO2) given on Day 10 of gestation, and at 24, 48, and 72 hr
thereafter. DMSA effectiveness was assessed at dosage levels of 0, 80, 160, and
320 mg/kg/day. Treatment with DMSA significantly reduced the embryolethality and 
the incidence of gross external and skeletal malformations and variations
provoked by NaAsO2. Based on these findings, the effect of increasing the time
interval between acute arsenite exposure and initiation of DMSA therapy was
investigated in a second experiment. On Day 10 of gestation, DMSA (320 mg/kg) was
administered sc to pregnant mice at 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1, 4, or 12 hr after a
12-mg/kg ip dose of NaAsO2. Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity derived from NaAsO2
exposure were significantly reduced when DMSA was given during the first hour
after NaAsO2 injection. According to these results, a delay between acute
arsenite intoxication and DMSA treatment should be avoided to have a practical
beneficial effect on the arsenite exposed conceptus.

Evidence for arsenic as the immunosuppressive component of gallium arsenide.

Burns LA(1), Sikorski EE, Saady JJ, Munson AE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Virginia,
Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298.

Gallium arsenide (GaAs) has been shown previously to suppress the in vivo
antibody-forming cell (AFC) response to sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) when
administered intratracheally at concentrations between 50 and 200 mg/kg. In the
present studies, direct addition of GaAs to in vitro-generated antibody cultures 
resulted in dose-dependent suppression of the primary antibody response, and was 
only seen when GaAs was added within 36 hr following immunization. Using atomic
absorption spectrophotometry on tissue samples from mice exposed to 200 mg/kg
GaAs, arsenic concentrations were found to peak in the spleen at 24 hr and
decline, whereas gallium concentrations continue to rise through 14 days.
Concentrations of each metal in the spleen at 24 hr are comparable to the
concentrations achieved for each metal when GaAs is added at 25 microM to the in 
vitro model system. The 24 hr time point was chosen for comparison because all in
vivo-in vitro studies were conducted using spleens from mice 24 hr after GaAs
exposure. NaAsO2 and Ga(NO3)3 suppressed the AFC response dose-dependently, and
in a time-dependent manner similar to GaAs when added to the in vitro system.
However, based on IC50 values for each salt, the role of the gallium component in
the immunosuppression appears weak. Oxalic acid (OA) and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), chelators of gallium and arsenic
respectively, were added to cultures with GaAs to confirm that arsenic was the
primary immunosuppressive component. DMSA dose-dependently blocked GaAs-induced
immunosuppression in vitro, while OA had no effect. The metal-binding compounds
were determined to be specific for the metals used in these studies and did not
cross-react with one another. DMSA was evaluated for its ability to prevent
suppression of the AFC response in splenocytes from GaAs-exposed mice and was
able to block GaAs-induced suppression of the AFC response when given sc every 4 
hr beginning 1 hr prior to GaAs exposure. These data indicate that the arsenic
component of GaAs is the major contributor to the GaAs-induced immunosuppression 
and that this effect occurs within the first 36 hr of the 5-day culture period in
a concentration-dependent manner.

Since 1986 we have performed suction of the ectopic ureteroceles in seven cases. 
In four of these cases the obstruction caused by the ureteroceles affected the
upper hemi-kidney. In the remaining three cases both hemi-kidneys of the same
side were affected. One child suffered failure of both hemi-kidneys. All the
ureteroceles corresponded to the upper hemi-kidney and were associated with
ipsilateral duplicity. In four of the cases the treatment applied was the
heminephrectomy of the upper hemi-kidney and the suction of the ureterocele. In
one case, we did a nephrectomy and suction of the ureterocele. In the remaining
two cases the suction of the ureterocele was done, as well as the
ureteropyelostomy, since it was necessary to use the upper hemi-kidney in the
renal TC99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scan-DMSA. In five of the children there was 
a collapse of the ureterocele giving good results in both kidneys. In two of the 
children there was no collapse, which provoked the need for removal of the
ureterocele. In one of these two cases, the renal dilatation persisted later. In 
the last case it was necessary to perform nephrectomy due to the absence of
recuperation of the renal function. Three of the children had associated reflux
which disappeared in one of them, after the suction of the ureterocele. Vesical
surgery might be avoided by means of the ureterocele's suction technique in 60
per 100 of the cases. However, it is essential to pursue the child's progress
once every six months, in order to detect possible failures of ureterocele
collapse.

The tumor-targeting radiopharmaceutical known as pentavalent technetium-99m-meso 
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been studied by a variety of techniques in
order to elucidate its structure and chemical behavior. The radiopharmaceutical
is identical with a chemically characterized sample of [99TcO(DMSA)2]- when
studied by mobility methods including thin-layer chromatography, reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography, gel filtration, and electrophoresis. The 
technetium is pentavalent and coordinated by an oxo-ligand and four thiolate
sulfurs of two DMSA ligands. No-carrier-added preparations consist of mixtures of
three stereoisomers of the square pyramidal, mononuclear complex. The isomers
arise from differing orientations of the carboxylate groups in the DMSA ligands
and may be designated syn-endo, syn-exo, and anti. All three isomers are
significant components of the radiopharmaceutical, raising the question of which 
are tumor-specific. The carboxylate groups in the complex are almost completely
ionized at pH 7, thus the average charge on the complex at this pH approaches -5.

Renal function and technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid uptake in single

The ability to evaluate kidney function in each kidney separately by quantitative
SPECT was tested in 20 patients with a single kidney and varying degrees of renal
disease. Technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) uptake was compared 
with renal function measured by creatinine clearance and serum creatinine. There 
was a good correlation for both serum creatinine (r = 0.89, y = 24.6 *X -1.15,
error = 5.6, p less than 0.001) and creatinine clearance (r = 0.76, y = 0.6 *X
0.84, error = 8.0, p less than 0.001). The results indicate that SPECT
quantitation of 99mTc-DMSA uptake can be used as an indicator of the function of 
each kidney individually.

Urinary excretion of mercury after occupational exposure to mercury vapour and
influence of the chelating agent meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).

Author information:

Catholic University of Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.

The spontaneous and chelator mediated excretion of mercury in urine was
investigated in male subjects occupationally exposed to mercury vapour (alkaline 
battery and chloralkali plants) who did not exhibit any sign of kidney damage.
The time course of the spontaneous elimination of mercury in urine was examined
in seven workers (age 22-40) who had been removed from exposure to mercury vapour
(average duration of exposure 4.4 years) because their urinary mercury
concentrations repeatedly exceeded 100 micrograms/g creatinine. The post exposure
observation period started 10 to 29 days after the date of removal and lasted
about 300 days (slow HgU elimination phase). For each worker, the kinetics of the
spontaneous HgU decline followed a first order process; the biological half life 
ranged from 69 to 109 days (mean 90 days). The increased urinary excretion of
mercury after a single oral administration of 2 g meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) was investigated in 16 control workers (group A; age 23 to 49), in 11
workers removed from exposure for at least two years (group B; age 27 to 41), and
in 16 workers currently exposed to mercury vapour (group C; age 21 to 58). In
group C, the DMSA experiment was repeated twice (three weeks before and three
weeks after a holiday) after measures had been taken to reduce the mercury
emission. The urinary mercury excretion was significantly higher during the 24
hours after DMSA administration in all groups compared with that in the 24 hours 
before. The bulk (50-70%) of the DMSA stimulated mercury excretion appeared
within the first eight hours. In each group, the amount of mercury (microgram
Hg/24h) excreted after DMSA was significantly correlated with that before
administration of DMSA. The groups whose exposure had ceased, however, exhibited 
much higher correlation for coefficients (r=0.97 for group B and 0.86 for group C
after three weeks of holiday) than those currently exposed to mercury vapour
(r-0.66 for group C before and 9.58 after reduction of exposure). The data
suggest that after a few days of cessation of occupational exposure to mercury
vapour the HgU before and after administration of DMSA mainly reflects the amount
of mercury stored in the kidney, which represents a mercury pool with a slow
turnover.

A convenient method for the preparation of 99mTc-labelled pentavalent DMSA and
its evaluation as a tumour imaging agent.

A cold kit has been developed for the instant preparation of 99mTc-(V)-DMSA. The 
radiochemical purity of the radiopharmaceutical was determined by chromatography.
A study of the effect of pH and stannous chloride concentrations on its labelling
efficiency demonstrated that pH 8.5-9.0 and 0.2 mg stannous chloride for 1.1 mg
DMSA provides the optimum formulation (98%). The addition of ascorbic acid
stabilized the kit for up to 24 weeks under refrigerated temperatures. The
radiopharmaceutical was found to concentrate in the bone and muscles in contrast 
to trivalent DMSA which accumulates in the liver and kidneys in normal mice.
Studies in patients have shown its usefulness in the scintigraphy of thyroid
medullary carcinoma and in the brain metastasis of breast carcinoma.

Effects of chelating agents on the cadmium burden of cells in culture.

Planas-Bohne F(1), Jones MM, Singh PK.

Author information: 
(1)Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Institut für Genetik und Toxikologie,
Germany.

The effects of some new chelating agents on the cadmium burden of CHO cells in
culture were investigated. The chelators were
sodium-N-(4-methoxybenzyl)-D-glucamine-dithiocarbamate (MeOBG-DTC),
sodium-N-benzyl-D-glucaminedithiocarbamate (BG-DTC) and
diisopropylmeso-2,3-dimercapto succinate (DiP-DMSA). The results were compared
with the effect of the well known dimercaptopropanol (BAL). The derivates of
dithiocarbamate are much less toxic than DiP-DMSA and BAL. All chelators
effectively prevent Cd uptake into the cells. Mobilization of intracellular Cd,
however, is more effective by the DTC-derivatives than by DiP-DMSA or BAL. Within
the cell the major fraction of Cd after 48 hours incubation is found in the
nuclei and cytosol and very little in the peroxisomes. The chelating agents
remove the metal mostly from nuclei and cytosol. Incubation of the cells with
cadmium leads to the induction of a Cd binding protein of an apparent molecular
weight of 12500 Da, presumably metallothionein. MeOBG-DTC is more effective in
removing the metal from this protein than BG-DTC.

[Assessment of 99mTc-DMSA renography and uptake compared with creatinine
clearance in rats with drug-induced nephrotoxicity--II. Cisplatin-induced
nephrotoxicity].

(1)Department of Radiology, Ehime University School of Medicine.

For evaluation of technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) renal
uptake as an absolute renal function, 99mTc-DMSA uptake was compared with
endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. At
first, Male Wistar rats were given intraperitoneally 1.8 mg/kg/day of cisplatin
for periods of 3, 5, 7 and 9 days. On the next day, 99mTc-DMSA uptake and Ccr
were measured. Ccr of 5-day treated group was significantly lower than that of
control (0.13 +/- 0.10 vs 0.34 +/- 0.05 ml/min/100 g; p less than 0.01) but
99mTc-DMSA uptake did not change. 99mTc-DMSA uptake of 7-day treated group was
significantly lower than that of control (28.57 +/- 7.23 vs 39.84 +/- 2.23%; p
less than 0.01). As the second experiment, cisplatin (3.6 mg/kg/day) was given
intraperitoneally on the 1st, 2nd, 15th and 16th day. On the 5th, 8th, 11th,
15th, 20th, 23rd, 26th and 30th day, the same measurements were done as the first
one. Ccr was lower in cisplatin treated rats on the 5th day than that in control 
(0.10 +/- 0.03 vs 0.34 +/- 0.05 ml/min/100 g; p less than 0.01), thereafter
tended to be recovered to the control level. On the other hand, 99mTc-DMSA uptake
was lower than that of control on the 8th, 11th and 15th day (32.40 +/- 3.86,
32.56 +/- 1.19, 35.21 +/- 2.97 vs 39.84 +/- 2.23%, respectively; p less than
0.01). The discrepancy between 99mTc-DMSA uptake and Ccr was observed in the
cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. 99mTc-DMSA uptake was suggested to be a
reliable indicator of a renal function in a different way from Ccr.

For evaluation of technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) renal
uptake as an absolute renal function, 99mTc-DMSA uptake was compared with
endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) in gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity.
Gentamicin (40 mg/kg/day) was given subcutaneously to male Wistar rats for
periods of 3, 6, 9 and 12 days. On the next day, the renography was performed 2
hours following intravenous injection of 99mTc-DMSA and Ccr was measured. On the 
7th day, 99mTc-DMSA uptake was significantly lower in the treated rats than that 
in control (32.27 +/- 0.92 vs 39.84 +/- 2.24%; p less than 0.01), but Ccr did not
change (0.37 +/- 0.02 vs 0.34 +/- 0.05 ml/min/100 g; NS). On the 1st, 2nd, 4th
and 8th day after single subcutaneous injection of 80 mg of gentamicin,
99mTc-DMSA uptake was measured and the histological examination was done. On the 
4th day, 99mTc-DMSA uptake was significantly lower than that on the 1st day
(32.32 +/- 3.00 vs 38.91 +/- 1.95%; p less than 0.01) and microscopic
examinations revealed that eosinophilic granular degenerations were evident in
the renal cortex. The present study suggests that 99mTc-DMSA uptake reduces
earlier than Ccr in gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity and 99mTc-DMSA uptake is a 
reliable indicator in the evaluation of a renal function in drug-induced
nephrotoxicity.

Chronic lead poisoning treated with dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Grandjean P(1), Jacobsen IA, Jørgensen PJ.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Community Health, Odense University, Denmark.

A 54-year-old male with chronic lead poisoning was treated with
2.3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). A daily dosage of 30 mg/kg body weight for
three days and 20 mg/kg for four days resulted in a decrease of the blood-lead
concentration (B-Pb) from 3.7 to 0.7 mumol/l; the total amount of lead excreted
in the urine during the first seven 24 hr periods was 75 mumol. After the
treatment, B-Pb slowly increased to 3.3 mumol/l. A second treatment was then
initiated and resulted in similar changes in B-Pb. However, during the third
treatment, the patient developed a mucocutaneous vesicular flare; the eruptions
faded after cessation of the chelation therapy, but could be provoked by DMSA
doses of 10 mg/kg and above. Despite the small number of treatment courses, the
patient showed obvious mental improvement and reported less headache and improved
memory. Thus, DMSA is an efficient chelator that results in a rapid, though
temporary decrease in B-Pb. Although oral treatment with this chelator may be
supervised from the out-patient clinic, careful monitoring for potential side
effects is recommended.

Metastatic carcinoma in the neck: a clinical, radiological, scintigraphic and
pathological study.

Author information:

This study was undertaken to compare clinical evaluation of the neck with
99mTc(v) DMSA planar scintigraphy and computerized tomography (CT) in patients
with head and neck carcinoma. Twenty-six patients were studied and in all but one
the neck was previously untreated. A total of 31 neck dissections were performed 
and the specimens examined histopathologically. CT was approximately as accurate 
(71%) as clinical examination (68%) and more accurate than 99mTc(v) DMSA planar
scintigraphy (48%) in predicting which necks contained metastatic carcinoma.
Overall, 13% of necks had their staging correctly changed by 99mTc(v) DMSA
scintigraphy compared with 10% for CT. Although scintigraphy upstaged 13% of
clinically N0 necks compared to 6% for CT, it was less sensitive and specific
than either clinical examination or CT. 99mTc(v) DMSA planar scintigraphy has no 
role to play in the investigation of patients with metastatic carcinoma to
include the clinically N0 neck.

Pentavalent Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy. Prospective evaluation of its role in the
management of patients with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.

Mojiminiyi OA(1), Udelsman R, Soper ND, Shepstone BJ, Dudley NE.

Author information:

Kingdom.

Ten patients with suspected primary, recurrent or metastatic medullary carcinoma 
of the thyroid (MCT) were studied prospectively with Tc-99m(V) DMSA. Of these,
two patients had primary disease, seven patients were asymptomatic but had
persistent and serial elevations in serum calcitonin following previous thyroid
resections for MCT, and one asymptomatic patient with normal serum calcitonin was
studied because of suspected hilar nodes metastases. The serial calcitonin peak
in the patients was 0.04-43ng/ml (normal less than 0.08ng/ml). Scintigraphy was
considered positive in seven of the asymptomatic patients and equivocal in one.
The two patients with primary disease had increased uptake before but not after
thyroidectomy. Primary disease, localized recurrence and distant metastases in
soft tissue (nine patients) and bone (one patient) were detected in these
patients, and this resulted in early surgical resection (five patients) and
radiotherapy (one patient). We conclude that Tc-99m(V) DMSA is a useful imaging
agent in the evaluation of asymptomatic MCT patients with hypercalcitonemia.

Features of primary vesicoureteric reflux detected by prenatal sonography.

Anderson PA(1), Rickwood AM.

Author information: 
(1)Regional Department of Paediatric Urology, Royal Liverpool Children's
Hospital, Alder Hey.

Primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was detected by prenatal sonography in 34
infants (55 renal units); males accounted for 31 cases. Associated genitourinary 
anomalies were common, occurring in 29% of the patients. Some element of
hydroureteronephrosis was noted at initial cystography in 89% of refluxing renal 
units, but the degree of renal abnormality at 99Tc DMSA renography was not
predicted by the severity of VUR. Overall, 60% of refluxing renal units were
renographically abnormal. Although a high rate of urinary infection was
encountered during follow-up, most DMSA assessments were carried out prior to
infection and hence likely reflect congenital rather than acquired abnormalities.
It was concluded that renal impairment associated with high grade primary VUR is 
frequently present at birth and not secondary to subsequent infection.

The detection of reflux nephropathy in infants by 99mtechnetium
dimercaptosuccinic acid studies.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Prince Henry Hospital, Sydney, Australia.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) studies were performed in 113 infants less than 1 
year old at risk of renal scarring. Of these patients 86 presented with urinary
tract infection and 27 were asymptomatic. A voiding cystourethrogram was
performed in all cases and excretory urography (IVP) was done in 99. More
abnormalities were detected by DMSA study when compared to scars on IVP. When
both studies were abnormal there was an excellent correlation on a site by site
basis. Fever or systemic disorder was not a reliable sign to determine whether
there was upper tract involvement with infection. The incidence of DMSA
abnormalities in infants increased with high grade vesicoureteral reflux and
decreased with low grade reflux. There was no significant difference in the
incidence of abnormal kidneys between the infected and noninfected groups,
suggesting that renal scarring may occur with sterile reflux.

Dimercapto [14C]succinic acid ([14C]DMSA) was given to male mice by ig 233 kBq.
The mice were sacrificed by immersion in dry ice/hexane at 1, 3, 9 and 24 h. The 
distribution and concentration of [14C]DMSA were observed and analysed by
whole-body autoradiograph. Higher concentration appeared in oral cavity,
esophagus, gastrointestinal contents, liver, kidney and urine at 1 or 3 h. A
moderate concentration was seen in blood, bone and skin. A remarkable reduction
of radioactivity was found in liver at 9 h, but GI contents, Harderian gland,
kidney and urine retained intense distribution. The results indicated that DMSA
absorbed rapidly per os and was eliminated by kidney within 24 h. No tissue had a
pronounced retention of the [14C]DMSA.

By means of Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, an established
method for assessing renal cortical damage, we evaluated the pick-up rate for
renal defects (scars) by single photon computed tomography (SPECT) and planar
images of 10 normal volunteers, and 58 patients (70 scintigrams) with upper
urinary tract infections, most of whom had a history of vesicoureteral reflux
(VUR). The positive study rate for renal defects depended on the severity of VUR.
The overall positive rates for renal cortical defects obtained by DMSA SPECT
imaging and DMSA planar imaging were 60% and 43%, respectively, and the
difference between these was significant (p less than 0.005). The mean absolute
individual renal uptake (/injected dose) at 2 hours post-injection was decreased 
in kidneys with defects detected by SPECT alone. The positive study rate for
intravenous urography (IVU) depended on the grade of VUR and was 15% overall.
DMSA SPECT imaging detects renal cortical defects at greater frequency than
previously achieved.

Chronic lead poisoning has traditionally been treated by parenteral agents. We
present a case where a comparison of ethylene diaminetetra-acetic acid was made
with 2,3-dimethyl succinic acid (DMSA) which has the advantage of oral
administration associated with little toxicity and appeared to be at least as
efficacious.

[The assessment of kidney function based on renal scintigraphy data with
99mTc-DMSA].

[Article in Russian]

Samedov RN.

Renoscintigraphy with 99mTc-DMCA with regard to a percentage of an RP uptake by
the kidney was performed in 70 patients with uronephrological lesions before
operation. A close relationship was established between a percentage of a
99mTc-DMCA uptake by the kidney on the 3rd hour after RP administration and
values of the effective renal plasma flow, calculated on the basis of the results
of renoscintigraphy with 131I-hippuran. Comparison of the 99mTc-DMCA uptake
percentage values on the 3rd and 24th hours in patients with marked lesions of
renal tubular functions has shown a high degree of correlation, permitting the
recommendation of quantitative renoscintigraphy on the 3rd hour. Analysis of the 
specific percentage of the RP uptake, calculated for 1 cm2 of the visualized
renal parenchyma, makes it possible to increase on the average by 29% the
detection of renal function in uronephrological patients.

Factors influencing the efficiency of chelation therapy.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Mineral Metabolism, University of Zagreb, Yugoslavia.

The purpose of the present study was to obtain new data on the effect of age,
route, dose and time of metal and chelating agent administration on the
efficiency of chelation therapy. The experiments were performed on 1-2 and
6-week-old rats which received radioisotopes of metals--203Pb, 115 mCd, 203Hg and
141Ce intraperitoneally or orally. Chelating agents calcium
ethylenediaminetetraacetate (CaEDTA), calcium and zinc
diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (CaDTPA, ZnDTPA),
2,3-dimercapto-propane-sulfonate-1 (DMPS), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and
sodium N-(4-methoxybenzyl)-D-glucamine dithiocarbamate monohydrate (MeOBDCG) were
administered twice by intraperitoneal or oral administration as early
(immediately and 24 hr after metals) or delayed treatment (24 and 48 or 48 and 72
hr after metals). The animals were killed six days after metal administration and
the retention was determined in the whole body, carcass and gut. After
intraperitoneal administration of metals and chelating agents chelation therapy
had much lower efficacy in younger than older animals. After ingestion of metals 
oral chelation therapy was more effective in younger than older animals. In
suckling rats the treatment effectively reduced metal retention and this was
mostly due to decrease in gut retention. This treatment in sucklings was also
very effective in condition of late administration. In older rats early oral DMPS
treatment after 203Hg ingestion is contraindicated since it increases
significantly mercury retention while DMSA and ZnDTPA treatments reduced mercury 
retention. Delayed oral treatment with ZnDTPA and DMSA caused increased cadmium
retention in older rats and decreased retention in sucklings. Opposite to results
with CaDTPA, MeOBDCG was effective in reducing cadmium retention also when given 
as delayed treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Twenty patients, 6 months to 11 year old, with clinically recognized acute
pyelonephritis, were evaluated with Tc99m DMSA renal scintigraphy in the first 15
days of their illness to validate this method in the detection of the acute renal
inflammatory disease. In 85% of Tc99m DMSA scintigraphies some kind of
abnormality (focal or diffuse, unilateral or bilateral) was observed. Second
renal images obtained at an average 8.5 months later, showed total disappearance 
of abnormal findings in 42%; partial regression in 50% and no changes in 8% of
these cases. Tc99m DMSA scintigraphy seems to be a good diagnostic tool to
confirm acute renal compromise in urinary tract infections. Besides follow up
examinations, at least three months later with this same method, were able to
confirm sustained renal lesions.

Isolated hepatocytes appear to be a suitable in vitro model for the testing of
the efficacy of chelating agents. In this study hepatocytes were isolated from
rats exposed to CdCl2 (50 mg Cd2+/l) in drinking water for 3 months. The cells
were incubated in a Krebs-Henseleit buffer for 2 hrs and the cytotoxicity was
assessed using 5 types of parameters. N-benzyl-D-glucaminedithiocarbamate (BGDTC)
and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were tested. Individual chelators in 
various concentrations were added to the incubation medium at the beginning of
the experiment (t = 0). The concentration of Cd in the extracellular fluid was
measured every 30 mins using flame AAS. Exposed hepatocytes did not show the
signs of damage. Both chelators did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect. BGDTC was
found to be efficient in the mobilization of Cd, while DMSA was ineffective.

Protective effects of chelating agents against renal toxicity of gold sodium

Author information:

University, Japan.

The protective effects of various chelating agents such as D-penicillamine
(D-PEN), 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 2,3-dimercaptopropane sulphonate
(DMPS), and N-(2-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl)-L-cysteine (bucillamine), on the
renal damage induced by gold sodium thiomalate (AuTM) in rats were studied. Rats 
were injected i.v. with AuTM at doses of 0.026, 0.066, 0.132, and 0.198 mmol/kg. 
Urinary excretion of protein, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and glucose in
rats injected with AuTM significantly increased compared to the control levels
within 1 day after the injection and thereafter decreased nearly to the control
levels at 3 or 7 days. Gold was excreted rapidly during the first day after AuTM 
injection and excreted gradually thereafter. The concentrations of gold in the
kidney and liver at 1 or 7 days after AuTM administration were approximately dose
dependent. Treatment with D-PEN, DMSA, DMPS, and bucillamine (1.2 mmol/kg)
significantly prevented increases in the urinary excretion of protein, AST, and
glucose and the BUN level after AuTM (0.026 mmol/kg) injection. The injection of 
the chelating agents after AuTM administration showed that D-PEN, DMSA, and DMPS 
enhanced mainly the urinary excretion of gold and that bucillamine enhanced
mainly the fecal excretion of the metal. These chelating agents significantly
decreased the gold concentrations in the kidney and liver. The findings suggest
that the chelating agents tested can ameliorate the renal damage induced by AuTM.

Renal injury in complete ureteric obstruction. A functional and morphological

(1)Institute of Child Health, London, UK.

This preliminary study examined reno-vascular injury sustained by the
multipapillary porcine kidney in acute and chronic complete ureteric obstruction.
In combination with measurement of upper tract pressure, regional function was
assessed by [99mTc]-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake and qualitative renal
perfusion, by resin casting of the arterial tree prior to scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). In acute obstruction, segmental defects were noted in the renal
poles on both [99mTc]-DMSA scanning and casting. On SEM there was a polar
afferent arteriolar vasodilatation after 30 min of obstruction and, subsequently,
a segmental reduction in cortical perfusion. In kidneys that had been obstructed 
for 20 days, we observed a marked reduction in outer cortical perfusion
coincident with afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. The pathogenesis and
significance of segmental injury to the multipapillary kidney in obstructive
uropathy is discussed.

Synthesis and properties of the monomethyl ester of meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
and its chelates of lead (II), cadmium(II), and mercury(II).

Rivera M(1), Levine DJ, Aposhian HV, Fernando Q.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721.

The monomethyl ester of meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (MoMeDMSA) and its chelates 
with lead(II), cadmium(II), and mercury(II) have been synthesized. The
mercury(II) chelate of MoMeDMSA is formed by the coordination of the two sulfur
atoms in MoMeDMSA, whereas the lead(II) and cadmium(II) chelates are formed by
the coordination of one sulfur and one oxygen atom. The solubilities of the
chelates are pH dependent; the mercury(II) chelate dissolves when the
uncoordinated carboxylic acid dissociates, but the lead(II) and cadmium(II)
chelates are solubilized only after the uncoordinated mercapto group is
dissociated. The cadmium(II) chelate is dimeric and the lead(II) and mercury(II) 
chelates are monomeric at the concentrations and conditions used in this study.
The acid dissociation constants of the chelating agent and the uncoordinated
groups in its metal chelates have been determined in 50% v/v methanol-water.
These acid-base properties in addition to the polarity of the chelating agent
contribute to the effectiveness in the in vivo mobilization of intracellular in
vivo deposits of cadmium. The biliary excretion of cadmium in rats increased by a
factor of 173 upon administration of the relatively toxic, nonpolar dimethyl
ester of DMSA whereas the administration of the less toxic, more polar monomethyl
ester increased the biliary excretion of cadmium by a factor of 63. On the other 
hand, meso-DMSA which is highly polar and less toxic is known to be without
effect on biliary excretion of cadmium. The monomethyl DMSA, therefore, appears
to have properties that are intermediate between those of DMSA and its dimethyl
ester, as far as both chelating properties and biliary excretion of cadmium are
concerned.

The relative effectiveness of British Anti-Lewisite (BAL),
dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), and a new 
metal binding agent 2,3-bis(acetylthio)propanesulfonamide (BAPSA) was compared by
determining their effect on pyruvate metabolism in perfused livers of guinea pigs
after repeated treatment with As2O3. Guinea pigs received As2O3, 2.5 mg/kg s.c.
twice daily on 5 consecutive days (total dose 25 mg/kg). Sixteen hours after the 
last dose the livers were perfused (2.5 ml/min/g liver) with Krebs-Henseleit
buffer and glucose (10 mmol/l) as substrate for 80 min. After 50 min of perfusion
0.1 or 0.7 mmol/l BAL, DMPS, DMSA, or BAPSA were added to the perfusate for 30
min. Samples of the effluent were collected every 10 min; lactate and pyruvate
were determined enzymatically. As compared to controls, a significant decrease in
the pyruvate and lactate efflux was observed in perfused livers of guinea pigs
treated with As2O3. After influx of BAL (0.1 mmol/l), DMSA (0.7 mmol/l), and
BAPSA (0.1 and 0.7 mmol/l) respectively, the pyruvate and lactate efflux and the 
oxygen consumption (exception BAL 0.1 mmol/l) increased and reached control
values without arsenic treatment. On the other hand, the pyruvate and lactate
efflux and the oxygen consumption was further significantly decreased after
influx of 0.7 mmol/l BAL.

Tubular dysfunction in proliferative lupus nephritis.

ter Borg EJ(1), de Jong PE, Meijer SS, Kallenberg CG.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Groningen, The
Netherlands.

We prospectively studied renal tubular function during 11 consecutive
exacerbations of proliferative glomerulonephritis in 8 patients with systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE). We found a rise in the fractional excretion of beta
2-microglobulin (p less than or equal to 0.05) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA;
p less than or equal to 0.02) during the exacerbations. These changes coincided
with a fall in the glomerular filtration rate (p less than or equal to 0.02).
Since fractional excretion of beta 2-microglobulin and DMSA can be considered as 
markers for tubular function, their rise during exacerbation and their fall (p
less than or equal to 0.01) to control values during remission indicate that
tubular dysfunction frequently occurs during active proliferative
glomerulonephritis in SLE and can be influenced by immunosuppressive treatment.
As no correlation was found between the different tubular function studies and
the activity index of tubulointerstitial abnormalities in the renal biopsy, it is
suggested that tubular function studies are probably a more sensitive indicator
of tubulointerstitial disease than this activity index.

Nitrate- and molybdenum-independent signal transduction mutations in narX that
alter regulation of anaerobic respiratory genes in Escherichia coli.

Kalman LV(1), Gunsalus RP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of California,
Los Angeles 90024.

Escherichia coli can respire anaerobically by reducing nitrate,
trimethylamine-N-oxide, dimethyl sulfoxide, or fumarate. When nitrate is present,
expression of the genes for fumarate (frdABCD), trimethylamine-N-oxide, and
dimethyl sulfoxide (dmsABC) is repressed while expression of the nitrate
reductase (narGHJI) gene is induced. This regulation requires molybdate and is
mediated by the narX and narL gene products, which together form a two-component 
regulatory system. We provide evidence that NarX is a nitrate and molybdenum
sensor which activates NarL when nitrate is available to cells. Mutants generated
by hydroxylamine mutagenesis were repressed for frdA-lacZ expression even when
cells were grown in the absence of nitrate. The mutations responsible for three
of these nitrate independence (NarX*) phenotypes were localized to narX and
further characterized in vivo for their ability to repress frdA-lacZ expression. 
Two of the mutants (the narX64 and narX71 mutants) had a greatly reduced
requirement for molybdenum to function but still responded to nitrate. In
contrast, a third mutant (the narX32 mutant) required molybdenum but did not
exhibit full repression of frdA-lacZ expression even when nitrate was present.
These narX* alleles also caused the induction of nitrate reductase gene
expression and the repression of a dmsA-lacZ fusion in the absence of nitrate.
Each narX* mutation was determined to lie in an 11-amino-acid region of the NarX 
polypeptide that follows a proposed transmembrane domain. We suggest that the
conformation of the narX* gene products is altered such that even in the absence 
of nitrate each of these gene products more closely resembles the wild-type NarX 
protein when nitrate is present. These data establish a clear role for the narX
gene product in gene regulation and strongly suggest its role in sensing nitrate 
and molybdenum.

Technetium-99m (99mTc) (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a new tumour-imaging
agent which has been used to image head and neck squamous carcinoma. This study
used an established rabbit tumour model to compare palpation versus planar
scintigraphy in the detection of superficially transplanted cancers. Palpation
detected 83% of tumours measuring less than 2 cm compared with 58% for
scintigraphy. Overall, the sensitivity for palpation was 88% (77% specificity)
compared with 50% (63% specificity) for scintigraphy.

Evaluation of the potential role of chelation therapy in treatment of low to
moderate lead exposures.

Chisolm JJ Jr(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

In the overall long-term management of lead poisoning, chelation therapy can have
short-term benefits; however, these benefits must be accompanied by drastic
reduction in environmental exposure to lead if therapy is to have any long-term
benefit. This discussion is limited to calcium disodium
ethylenediaminetetraacetate (CaNa2EDTA), the chelating agent that has been the
mainstay of treatment of lead poisoning for the past 38 years, and to
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), a new and promising oral chelating
agent, which is an orphan drug and is currently classified as an investigational 
new drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. With both drugs, multiple
courses of treatment will be needed if any substantial reduction in body lead
burden is to be achieved. A major limitation of CaNa2EDTA is the enormous
diuresis of zinc that it produces. DMSA produces a comparable diuresis of lead, a
greater decrease in blood lead, and has negligible influence on the urinary
losses of zinc, copper, iron, and calcium. Limited experience to date in man has 
revealed no significant adverse side effects of DMSA. In animals, DMSA will
promptly reduce the concentration of lead in brain and kidney, in particular. By 
contrast, similar 5-day courses of CaNa2EDTA do not produce any net reduction in 
brain lead. This is important, as the brain is the critical organ of the adverse 
effects of lead in children. If the efficacy of DMSA is to be comprehensively
evaluated ethically in children, new and more sensitive neurochemical,
electrophysiologic, or other markers must be developed.

Mutations in fnr that alter anaerobic regulation of electron transport-associated
genes in Escherichia coli.

Melville SB(1), Gunsalus RP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of California,
Los Angeles 90024.

The fnr gene product, FNR, is a global regulator of anaerobic gene expression in 
Escherichia coli. When E. coli is switched from aerobic to anaerobic growth
conditions, cytochrome o (cyoABCDE) and d oxidase (cydAB) genes are repressed and
the anaerobic terminal reductase genes, including nitrate (narGHJI), dimethyl
sulfoxide/trimethylamine (dmsABC), and fumarate (frdABCD) reductase, are induced.
To determine if certain amino acid residues are essential for FNR to function in 
this regulatory process, site-directed mutations were introduced into the fnr
gene. The resulting mutant proteins were assayed in vivo for their ability to
either activate dmsA'-'lacZ and frdA'-'lacZ gene expression, or repress
expression of a cyoA'-'lacZ gene fusion. The fnr mutants were grouped into four
classes. Class I exhibited a severe decrease in the ability to either activate or
repress fnr-dependent gene expression. Mutations in four of the five cysteine
residues in the FNR protein were in this class. The sole exception was an FNR
Cys16----Ser "mutant" that exhibited normal activity. Class II mutations caused a
mild reduction in FNR-dependent activation or repression while Class III
mutations conferred a modest increase in the ability of the FNR protein to
activate gene expression under aerobic conditions (i.e. FNR*). Finally, Class IV 
mutations lowered the modest aerobic FNR transcriptional activation function
proportionally more than the anaerobic FNR activity. These findings identify an
essential role for the NH2 terminus of the FNR protein in its various activities 
in anaerobic gene regulation.

Unusual Tc-99m MDP and I-123 MIBG images in focal pyelonephritis.

A 6-year-old boy presented with an inflammatory syndrome. Because Tc-99m MDP bone
scintigraphy revealed increased tracer uptake at the upper pole of the right
kidney, further studies were oriented towards a diagnosis of renal or adrenal
pathology. I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) accumulated at the site of the
abnormal MDP uptake. The diagnosis of neuroblastoma or allied disorder was
excluded on the basis of other investigations and further evaluation, suggesting 
that the MIBG uptake was a false-positive. Findings on clinical imaging,
laboratory findings, Tc-99m DMSA imaging, sonography, and CT scanning were highly
suggestive of acute focal pyelonephritis.

The diagnostic value of 123-I-MIBG (meta-iodobenzylguanidine) scintigraphy was
investigated in six patients with recurrence and/or metastatic spread of a
medullary thyroid carcinoma. In no case was there MIBG storage in tumor tissue.
Thus, our results show that MIBG scintigraphy is not suitable as a screening
method either in the primary diagnostics or the follow-up of medullary thyroid
carcinoma. If, however, inoperable metastases have been detected by other
diagnostic methods, MIBG scintigraphy is indicated in order to test a potential
therapeutic application in these patients. In the imaging diagnostics and
follow-up of medullary thyroid carcinoma, the examination with 99mTc(V)-DMSA
(technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinate) is markedly superior to MIBG scintigraphy.
High-resolution cervical sonography is of major importance in the hands of an
experienced examiner.

99mTc(V)-DMSA scintigraphy is a non-invasive diagnostic tool for diagnostic
differentiation and localisation of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. For
primary tumours its sensitivity is 77%. This diagnostic means is not only helpful
for the diagnosis of primary tumours, but is especially informative for recidives
and metastases of the medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Its sensitivity for
recidives and metastases is 66%. The sensitivity obtained in our study, which
included four patients, corresponded to that reported in the literature.

The ability of zinc to enhance the efficacy of commonly used chelating drugs in
lead intoxication and to reduce the resulting zinc imbalance, was investigated in
rats. The simultaneous zinc supplementation increased urinary lead elimination by
calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Ca disodium EDTA) and 2,3
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). Combination therapy was also effective in
potentiating the depletion of blood, hepatic and renal lead by calcium disodium
EDTA and D-penicillamine (DPA), renal lead by DMSA and reversal of inhibited
blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity by calcium disodium
EDTA and DPA. The body zinc status was also maintained as reflected by urinary,
blood and tissue levels of zinc.

[Renal function in children with solitary kidney].

[Article in Japanese]

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Tohoku University School of Medicine.

Renal function of eighteen children with solitary kidney (14 congenital and 4
acquired) was assessed using DMSA renal uptake rate and urinary excretion of
alpha 1-MG, beta 2-MG, NAG and microalbumin. Seven of the cases were associated
with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and two with congenital hydronephrosis. These
anomalies have been already treated surgically before entering this study. DMSA
renal uptake rate of 8 children was the same as that of the controls (51.8 +/-
3.7%; mean +/- SD). However, the uptake rate of 10 cases were more than 2SD below
the mean of the controls. In five of them, including two children with no other
urinary tract anomaly, the uptake rate was less than 70% of the mean of the
controls. Half of 14 children evaluated with alpha 1-MG showed high values. In 6 
of these 7 cases, DMSA renal uptake rate was more than 2SD below the mean of the 
controls. Urinary microalbumin was not correlated with urinary alpha 1-MG or DMSA
renal uptake rate. Three of 4 children with high values of urinary microalbumin
were more than 10 years old. Nine of 12 children evaluated with all the indices
mentioned above showed high values of urinary alpha 1-MG and/or microalbumin. Low
DMSA renal uptake rate was revealed in 7 out of these 9 children including two
cases without urinary tract anomaly. These results indicate that, in the cases
with solitary kidney even though no other urinary tract anomaly is recognized,
renal overload may have already developed in early life.

[A long-term observation of development from monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance (MGUS) into primary amyloidosis].

[Article in Japanese]

Kanoh T(1), Yago K, Okuma M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University.

The term, "monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)" is used
because it is not known at the time of recognition whether the M-component will
remain stable or will develop into multiple myeloma (MM) or related disorders.
Recently, we have encountered a case of MGUS in which a diagnosis of primary
amyloidosis (PA) was made more than 10 years after the recognition of an
M-component in the serum. A 64-year-old man presented in 1979 for evaluation of
monoclonal gammopathy. The level of M-component (IgG-lambda) in the serum was 1.6
g/dl. The urinary Bence Jones proteins (BJP) were negative. Bone marrow aspirate 
contained 9.8% plasma cells. Skeletal surveys were normal. A diagnosis of MGUS
was made. In 1982, a trace amount of BJP was detected in the urine. Since 1988,
carpal tunnel syndrome, angina pectoris and congestive heart failure developed in
succession. In November 1989, the patient was admitted to Kyoto University
Hospital for examination. Serum electrophoretic pattern remained unchanged. The
excreted amount of urinary BJP was less than 0.3 g/day. Bone marrow aspirate
contained 5.4% plasma cells. Histologic studies of bone marrow biopsy specimens
revealed amyloid deposition. An echocardiogram was thought to reveal amyloidosis.
Significant uptake of Tc-99m (V) DMSA was found in carpal regions, kidneys and
heart. A diagnosis of PA was made. It is noteworthy that the development of PA
did not accompany an increase in the serum M-component. An early diagnosis of PA 
as well as MM should be kept in mind in the follow-up study of patients with
MGUS.

To calculate renal uptake of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) more accurately
using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), it is necessary to
estimate values of threshold level, which corresponds to the ratio of kidney to
background (BG ratio). Thus the phantom and clinical studies were conducted. Six 
kinds of renal phantoms of 80 to 339 ml, contained different radioactivity of 37 
to 485 MBq were prepared. These phantoms were placed in a larger body phantom
filled with 1 to 50% of radioactivity representing background. Clinical
application of this method was also performed. Results were as follows. 1) A
significant correlation between phantom volumes and estimated volumes obtained
using threshold level based on BG ratio calculated on tomographic images was
found (r = 0.99). 2) A significant correlation between total counts in estimated 
volumes and radioactivities in phantoms was recognized (r = 0.94). 3) Known
radioactivity in phantoms and radioactivity in estimated volumes were highly
related (r = 0.98). 4) Clinical application showed valuable results in patients
with renal dysfunction. Thus, this method can calculate more accurate renal
uptake of 99mTc-DMSA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Otolaryngology, Guy's Hospital, London.

Technetium-99m (Tc99m)(v) Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (DMSA) is an imaging agent
which has been proposed as a scintigraphic marker for head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma. Fifty-four patients were studied of whom 51 had a head and neck
tumour. All patients were examined and then imaged using Tc99m(v) DMSA
scintigraphy and computerized tomography. Scintigraphy was less sensitive than
clinical examination in the detection of patients with cancer, patients with
primary tumours and patients with metastatic neck disease. CT was as sensitive
and as accurate as clinical examination but more sensitive than Tc99m(v) DMSA in 
detecting patients with cancer and with primary tumours. CT was more sensitive
and more accurate than both clinical examination and Tc99m(v) DMSA scintigraphy
in predicting which patients had metastatic neck disease. Although Tc99m(v) DMSA 
is accumulated by squamous cell carcinoma, its inability to detect low volume
disease and apparent low specificity means it has no role to play in the
management of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

Organization of dimethyl sulfoxide reductase in the plasma membrane of
Escherichia coli.

Sambasivarao D(1), Scraba DG, Trieber C, Weiner JH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

Dimethyl sulfoxide reductase is a trimeric, membrane-bound, iron-sulfur
molybdoenzyme induced in Escherichia coli under anaerobic growth conditions. The 
enzyme catalyzes the reduction of dimethyl sulfoxide, trimethylamine N-oxide, and
a variety of S- and N-oxide compounds. The topology of dimethyl sulfoxide
reductase subunits was probed by a combination of techniques. Immunoblot analysis
of the periplasmic proteins from the osmotic shock and chloroform wash fluids
indicated that the subunits were not free in the periplasm. The reductase was
susceptible to proteases in everted membrane vesicles, but the enzyme in outer
membrane-permeabilized cells became protease sensitive only after detergent
solubilization of the E. coli plasma membrane. Lactoperoxidase catalyzed the
iodination of each of the three subunits in an everted membrane vesicle
preparation. Antibodies to dimethyl sulfoxide reductase and fumarate reductase
specifically agglutinated the everted membrane vesicles. No TnphoA fusions could 
be found in the dmsA or -B genes, indicating that these subunits were not
translocated to the periplasm. Immunogold electron microscopy of everted membrane
vesicles and thin sections by using antibodies to the DmsABC, DmsA, DmsB subunits
resulted in specific labeling of the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane.
These results show that the DmsA (catalytic subunit) and DmsB (electron transfer 
subunit) are membrane-extrinsic subunits facing the cytoplasmic side of the
plasma membrane.

Radiation injury in the human kidney: a prospective analysis using specific
scintigraphic and biochemical endpoints.

Leeuwenhoek Huis, Amsterdam.

Renal function was prospectively analyzed in 26 evaluable patients, irradiated to
various doses on their kidneys for neoplastic disease. Glomerular function was
assessed by 99mTc-DTPA renography, creatinine clearance, and serum beta
2-microglobulin, whereas tubular function was monitored by 99mTc-DMSA
scintigraphy, urine beta 2-microglobulin, urine N-acetyl glucosaminidase, and
alanine aminopeptidase and a urine concentration test. In the patients given the 
highest irradiation dose to the entire left kidney, that is, 40 Gy in 5 1/2
weeks, glomerular and tubular functional impairment, as assessed
scintigraphically, progressed at a rate of 2.0 +/- 1.0% (+/- 1 SD) and 2.0 +/-
0.5% per month, respectively, down to 30-40% after 3 to 5 years. The overall
glomerular function, as assessed by creatinine clearance, decreased by only 20%. 
In the patients irradiated unilaterally on the upper pole to 40 Gy in 4 weeks,
glomerular and tubular function in the left kidney deteriorated at 0.75 +/- 0.33%
and 0.75 +/- 0.20% per month in the first 2 years, down to 75-80% at 5 years.
This smaller reduction was due to shielding of a part of the left kidney. No
changes were observed, thus far, after bilateral whole kidney irradiation to
17-18 Gy in 3 1/2 weeks. The concentration capacity of the kidney after total
volume irradiation was not impaired. There was a trend for an increase in
diastolic blood pressure in 3 out of 5 patients given the high dose irradiation
to the entire left kidney and in 2 out of 7 patients irradiated on the upper pole
of the left kidney. The progressive nature of the radiation nephropathy stresses 
the need for long term follow-up to determine more accurately the "tolerance
dose" of the human kidney for irradiation.

Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic characterization of dimethyl
sulfoxide reductase of Escherichia coli.

Cammack R(1), Weiner JH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

The electron transfer centers in dimethyl sulfoxide reductase were examined by
EPR spectroscopy in membranes of the overproducing Escherichia coli strain
HB101/pDMS159, and in purified enzyme. Iron-sulfur clusters of the [4Fe-4S] type 
and a molybdenum center were detected in the protein, which comprises three
different subunits: DmsA, -B, and -C. The intensity of the reduced iron-sulfur
clusters corresponded to 3.82 +/- 0.5 spins per molecule. The dithionite-reduced 
clusters were reoxidized by DMSO or TMAO. The enzyme, as prepared, showed a
spectrum of Mo(V), which resembles the high-pH form of E. coli nitrate reductase.
The Mo(V) detected by EPR was absent from a mutant which does not assemble the
molybdenum cofactor. In these cases, the levels of EPR-detectable iron-sulfur
clusters in the cells were increased. Extracts from HB101/pDMS159 enriched in
DmsA showed more Mo(V) signals and considerably less iron-sulfur. These results
are in agreement with predictions from amino acid sequence comparisons, that the 
molybdenum center is located in DmsA, while four iron-sulfur clusters are in
DmsB. The midpoint potentials of the molybdenum and iron-sulfur clusters in the
various preparations were determined by mediator titrations. The iron-sulfur
signals could be best fitted by four clusters, with midpoint potentials spread
between -50 and -330 mV. The midpoint potentials of the iron-sulfur clusters and 
Mo(V) species were pH dependent. In addition, all potentials became less negative
in the presence of the detergent Triton X-100. Observation of relaxation
enhancement of the Mo(V) species by the reduced [4Fe-4S] clusters indicated that 
the centers are in proximity within the protein.

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine relative
binding constants for several arsenical-antidote adducts. It was found that BAL
(2,3-dimercaptopropanol) and DMPS (2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid) had a
higher affinity than DMSA (2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) for the two organic
arsenicals studied.

Surgery in unilateral multicystic kidney.

Kullendorff CM(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatric Surgery, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.

During a 15-year period 29 patients were treated for unilateral multicystic
kidney. The diagnosis was obtained from antenatal ultrasonography in 17 cases,
investigation of an abdominal mass at routine palpation in 10, UTI investigation 
in 1 and uraemia investigation in 1. Eleven patients had associated
malformations. Further investigations included ultrasonography, intravenous
pyelography, micturition uretrocystography and in a few cases computed tomography
and Dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scan. Percutaneous pyelography was performed 
in 9 cases. Twenty-six children were operated on and 3 were not operated, of
which 1 with severe cardiac malformations, died. The age at operation was under 6
months in 14 cases and between 6 and 12 months in 8. Four children developed
hypertension preoperatively but the hypertension disappeared within 1 week
postoperatively in all cases. The indication for surgery in unilateral
multicystic kidney seems to be clear if the patient is symptomatic. In the
asymptomatic patient, the complications of a remaining multicystic kidney like
hypertension, malignancy, infection and pain suggest a surgical approach at
around 6 months of age.

Urinary LMOX concentration was studied in 18 patients with unilateral ureteral
obstruction. The concentration of LMOX in the urine from the mild obstructed
kidney was 124 to 2,140 micrograms/ml and 10 micrograms/ml in the severely
obstructed ones. The difference was probably due to the intensity and the
duration of the obstruction. The patient with 99mTc-DMSA renal uptake of less
than 3% also had a urinary LMOX concentration of less than 7 micrograms/ml. The
above results seem to show that 7 micrograms/ml in urinary LMOX concentration is 
a significant figure for treatment of UTI. 99mTc-DMSA renal uptake and renal
echogram were used to estimate the excretion rate of antibiotics into the urine.

Extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy (EPL) has been recently introduced as a 
non-invasive method for treatment of renal and gall bladder stones. Thirty seven 
patients treated with EPL for renal calculi were the subjects of radionuclide
renal studies. The aim was to evaluate the effects of EPL as a new technology by 
radionuclide renography. 99Tcm-DTPA and 99Tcm-DMSA studies were performed pre-EPL
and one day and one week post-EPL. Various parameters of the sequential
radionuclide studies were evaluated. One day post-EPL, changes in parenchymal
transit time index, relative uptake function, glomerular filtration rate,
time-activity curves and kidney dimensions were observed. At one week post-EPL,
different parameters returned to baseline status in the majority of cases. The
study indicates that EPL has a variety of effects on the kidney that could be
demonstrated and followed by sequential radionuclide renal studies. Furthermore
the study suggests spacing of EPL sessions by approximately one week.

Technetium-99m(99Tcm) (V) dimercaptosuccinic acid is a new imaging agent which
has been used to evaluate head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This study
compared the subcellular biodistribution of 99Tcm(V)DMSA in an established rabbit
tumour SCC model and in humans with head and neck SCC. In rabbits, approximately 
17-37% of radioactivity was located on tumour cell membrane. Approximately 57-80%
of radioactivity was located nonspecifically in tumour cytosol, only 2-6% was
bound specifically to tumour mitochondria, and 1-4% bound specifically to
microsomes. In humans, 25-45% of radioactivity was localized on tumour cell
membrane and 28-60% localized nonspecifically in tumour cytosol. There was 11-20%
of radioactivity specifically bound inside the cell to the mitochondria and 1-6% 
specifically bound to microsomes. These results show that although 99Tcm(V)DMSA
is accumulated at sites of SCC, the localization process is nonspecific.

Determination and metabolism of dithiol chelating agents: X. In humans,
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid is bound to plasma proteins via mixed disulfide 
formation.

meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is orally effective for the treatment of 
chronic lead intoxication in humans. Earlier studies have shown that the majority
of DMSA, given p.o. to normal humans, is excreted in the urine as mixed
disulfides with L-cysteine. We have developed an assay for the determination of
DMSA that has made possible the determination of the form of DMSA in blood and
plasma. After p.o. administration of 10 mg DMSA/kg to four normal young men, no
unaltered DMSA (unaltered DMSA is the unbound, parent compound; total DMSA
consists of unaltered DMSA plus oxidized (disulfide) DMSA and is determined after
reduction with dithiothreitol) was found in the blood over an 8-hr period. Only
after treatment of blood or plasma with the disulfide-reducing agent,
dithiothreitol, was DMSA detected. This indicates that DMSA is in disulfide
linkage with plasma proteins and/or non-protein sulfhydryl compounds. Most of the
DMSA in the plasma (92-95%) was found to be bound to plasma proteins, mainly
albumin. The remaining DMSA may be bound to small molecular weight (less than
10,000 MW) nonprotein sulfhydryl compounds such as cysteine. Plasma protein
appears to serve as a depot and reservoir of DMSA, which can exchange for
cysteine. The urinary excretion of unaltered DMSA and DMSA mixed disulfides with 
L-cysteine suggests that this exchange takes place at the kidney.(ABSTRACT

This is a case report on a patient with double cancer of kidney and urinary
bladder. The patient was a 65-year-old female, and she was admitted with the
chief complaint of gross hematuria and right flank pain. After careful
examinations, she was diagnosed with right nonfunctioning kidney caused by
invasive bladder cancer. Computerized tomography incidentally revealed a mass in 
the upper pole of the left kidney. Selective left renal arteriography showed
stretched arteries and irregularity and tortuosity of the smaller vessels. She
was diagnosed with double cancer of bladder and left kidney. Owing to the damage 
of the right renal function, left partial nephrectomy, total cystectomy, right
nephroureterectomy and left ureterocutaneostomy were performed. According to DMSA
scintigraphy measured 15 days later, the uptake value of the left kidney was
13.25%, compared to the preoperative value of 25.62%. To date, this case is 36th 
reported case in Japan.

The use of 99mtechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scintigraphy for
the early diagnosis of pyelonephritis has been evaluated in a study performed on 
adolescent female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to an ascending Escherichia coli
infection. The rats were studied with DMSA scintigraphy either before and 5 days 
after the infection or 5 and 28 days after the infection. One group of rats
received anti-microbial treatment during days 6-11. After the last DMSA
scintigraphy the rats were sacrificed and the kidneys prepared for light
microscopy study. Kidney morphology was normal and DMSA uptake was high and
homogeneous in all control rats. The majority of the rats exposed to E. coli
developed inflammatory changes, on light microscopy which extended to various
degrees in the renal parenchyma. Five days after the infection the DMSA uptake
was consistently reduced, if the inflammatory lesion on light microscopy involved
more than 15% of the renal cortex. Twenty-eight days after infection the
inflammatory changes were less extensive than at 5 days. The DMSA uptake had
usually improved. At this time, however, areas of decreased DMSA uptake could be 
detected even if the light microscopy changes involved less than 15% of the
parenchyma. Microscopical lesions were less frequent and less extensive in the
treated than in the untreated rats. The complete return to normal of previously
abnormal DMSA uptake was only observed in treated rats. In a few untreated rats
cortical scars had formed by day 28. The scars appeared in areas with decreased
DMSA uptake at 5 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Evaluation of the efficacy of dimercapto chelating agents for the treatment of
systemic organic arsenic poisoning in rabbits.

Inns RH(1), Rice P, Bright JE, Marrs TC.

Author information: 
(1)Medical Division, Chemical Defence Establishment, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK.

1 The standard drug for the treatment of arsenic poisoning is BAL (dimercaprol). 
BAL possesses marked side-effects and a low safety ratio, drawbacks which new BAL
analogues, DMPS and DMSA, do not possess. 2 The efficacy of three chelating
agents, BAL, DMPS and DMSA, has been evaluated as a treatment for systemic
organic arsenic poisoning, induced by intravenous dichloro(2-chlorovinyl)arsine
(lewisite) administration to rabbits. Equimolar dosing schedules were used based 
upon realistic doses for the most toxic agent, BAL. 3 It was concluded that all
three dimercapto chelating agents provided significant protection against the
lethal systemic effects of lewisite, and, under the test conditions reported
here, there was no significant difference between them in therapeutic efficacy. 4
The cause of mortality following intravenous lewisite in treated and untreated
rabbits was pulmonary damage. 5 It is considered that DMPS and DMSA are worthy of
further study as replacements for BAL in the treatment of systemic poisoning by
lewisite.

The effect of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on mineral metabolism was
investigated in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were given by gavage doses 
of 0, 100, 300, or 1000 mg DMSA/kg/d on gestational d 6-15. On d 20 of gestation 
dams were killed and fetuses were removed from the uterus. The levels of calcium,
magnesium, zinc, copper, and iron were measured in maternal liver, kidney, and
intestine, as well as in whole fetus and in fetal liver. Mineral analysis of
maternal and fetal tissues revealed pronounced effects of DMSA on mineral
metabolism. The results of this investigation indicate a strong possibility that 
the negative effects of the drug on pregnancy are due in part to the changes in
mineral metabolism.

meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), an effective antagonist for the
treatment of lead, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium poisoning, was evaluated for
developmental toxicity in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. DMSA was administered by 
gavage on d 6-15 of gestation at doses of 0, 100, 300, or 1000 mg DMSA/kg/d. At
termination on d 20 of gestation, fetuses were examined for external, visceral,
and skeletal malformations and variations. Maternal toxicity was observed at all 
doses, as evidenced by a significant decrease in body weight gain. There were no 
effects with respect to hematology or clinical chemistry. Increased early
resorptions, increased percentage postimplantation loss, and reduced fetal body
weight per litter were observed at 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/d. Examination of
fetuses for gross external abnormalities, visceral and skeletal malformations, or
ossification variations revealed that DMSA did not produce teratogenicity at any 
dosage level. However, significant fetotoxicity was observed at 100, 300, and
1000 mg/kg/d. The no-observable-effect level (NOEL) for maternal and
developmental toxicity was less than 100 mg DMSA/kg/d.

Technical and operative factors in infrarenal aortic reconstruction and their
effect on the glomerular filtration rate in the immediate postoperative period
and 6 months later.

Renal failure is an important cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality in
infrarenal aortic reconstruction. Several mechanisms for this postoperative renal
dysfunction have been suggested. However, biochemical testing of renal function
is insensitive since it shows only gross renal changes. This study examined
prospectively the effects of the technical and operative factors on renal
function using radionuclide tests. The authors measured the total Glomerular
Filtration Rate (GFR) using 51Cr-EDTA clearance in 59 patients undergoing
elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction. We also examined the individual
kidneys using 99mTc-DTPA renography and 99mTc-DMSA renal scanning. Renal scanning
gives the percentage of function of each kidney, while renography gives a graphic
assessment of individual renal perfusion and clearance. All tests were carried
out preoperatively, 2 weeks postoperatively and 6 months later. Twelve technical 
factors including aortic cross clamping time, type of aortic anastomosis, forced 
diuresis, division of left renal vein and various others were recorded to study
their effect on the GFR and the individual kidney function. The effect on renal
function of these operative factors has not previously been described. GFR showed
no change in the immediate postoperative period. Six months later GFR decreased, 
the mean decrease was 9 ml/min. (P = 0.007 Wilcoxon rank). Some of our patients
showed an increased GFR, a phenomenon that was recognised recently. None of the
factors studied, except division of the left renal vein, had any effect on the
changes in the GFR in the immediate postoperative period or 6 months later.

Effect of chelating agents on biliary excretion of arsenic in perfused livers of

The effect of the dithiols British Anti-Lewisite (Bal),
dimercapto-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and a new 
metal binding agent 2,3-bis-(acetylthio)-propanesulfonamide (BAPSA) on the
biliary excretion of arsenic in perfused livers of guinea pigs pretreated with
As2O3 was investigated. Guinea pigs received As2O3, 2.5 mg/kg sc twice daily for 
5 consecutive days. Sixteen hours after the last dose the livers were perfused
(35 ml/min) with Krebs-Henseleit buffer with glucose for 80 min. After 50 min of 
perfusion 0.1 mmol/L or 0.7 mmol/L BAL, DMSA, DMPS, or BAPSA were added to the
perfusate and arsenic elimination in the bile and effusate was measured. The
total arsenic excretion in control livers between the 50th and 80th min was 6.1% 
of the total arsenic liver content. After antidote addition (0.1 mmol/L) the
excretion increased to 7.9% (DMSA), 9.2% (BAL), 23.9% (BAPSA), and 27.1% (DMPS), 
respectively. After 0.7 mmol/L of antidote the excretion of arsenic was found to 
be 19.3% (DMSA), 19.9% (DMSA), 24.0% (BAL), and 43.3% (BAPSA), respectively. The 
increase resulted mainly from increased biliary excretion. In these experiments
BAPSA was significantly more effective in the overall elimination of arsenic than
DMSA, DMPS, and BAL. The treatment with chelating agents may cause a substantial 
shift to fecal elimination by the increase in biliary excretion (BAL less than
DMSA less than DMPS less than BAPSA). From the therapeutic view the shift to
fecal elimination may have the advantage that the amount of the toxicant which
passes the kidney is reduced and thereby also the portion which might be harmful 
for the organ.

Comparison of 99Tcm dimercaptosuccinic acid scans and intravenous urography in
children.

Whitear P(1), Shaw P, Gordon I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Hospital for Sick Children, London.

A retrospective comparison of 99Tcm dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans and
intravenous urograms (IVUs) was performed on a large, unselected paediatric
population to assess critically the relative merits of these two techniques. A
total of 205 children were studied, providing 388 kidneys for comparison. The
studies agreed in 81%, both being normal in 39%, and both abnormal in 42%. In 28 
kidneys (7%), the IVU was abnormal when the 99Tcm DMSA was normal. There was a
collecting system abnormality in 27 kidneys, but 10 kidneys also showed a
parenchymal abnormality. In all these the parenchymal abnormality was global
thinning on the IVU, and the contralateral kidney was small. In 40 kidneys (10%) 
the 99Tcm DMSA was abnormal when the IVU was normal: the abnormalities
demonstrated were predominantly focal defects. After excluding IVUs of poor
diagnostic quality, only 14 kidneys (3.6%) showed this disparity. The important
clinical subgroups are infection, with or without reflux (27 kidneys),
hypertension (4) and neonates with poor renal function (2). The one false
positive 99Tcm DMSA was a result of an anatomical variant. Global thinning in a
"normal" kidney on a 99Tcm DMSA scan may be overlooked when the contralateral
kidney is poorly functioning and small.

Extracorporeal regional complexing haemodialysis treatment of acute inorganic
mercury intoxication.

Buffalo.

A 70-year-old white female presented approximately 24 h after ingesting three 475
mg tablets (1.425 g) of mercuric chloride in a suicide attempt. Acute renal
failure necessitated the initiation of haemodialysis approximately 4 d after the 
ingestion. Treatment with BAL (2,3-dimercaptopropanol) resulted in only small
increases in mercury output into dialysate. A new procedure involving the
extracorporeal infusion of the chelating agent dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
into the arterial blood line during haemodialysis was initiated. This procedure
of Extracorporeal Regional Complexing Haemodialysis (ERCH) had been effective in 
increasing methylmercury removal in patients poisoned by contaminated grain. The 
first DMSA-ERCH procedure was performed 6 d after poisoning. There was a dramatic
increase in mercury output into the dialysate. During three treatment sessions of
80 min each, 1189 micrograms of mercury were removed from the patient. The
dialysed mercury represented the only mercury output since the patient was anuric
and not producing faeces. DMSA-ERCH appears to be much more effective than BAL
and haemodialysis in the treatment of acute inorganic mercury poisoning. The long
interval between poisoning and initiation of treatment probably contributed to
the patients ultimate demise, 28 d after poisoning. Efficacy of the DMSA-ERCH
procedure for inorganic mercury poisoning is likely to be improved as the
interval between exposure and treatment is reduced.

Technetium-99m (99Tcm)(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a new tumour imaging 
agent which has been used to evaluate squamous carcinoma (SCC) of the head and
neck. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of
99Tcm(V)DMSA in patients with SCC and calculated the bone mass of a New Zealand
White (NZW) rabbit. This data was then used to calculate the effective dose
equivalent in man. A total of 16 patients were studied (5 with no tumour, 11 with
tumour). 99Tcm(V)DMSA had a fast bi-exponential blood clearance in patients with 
no tumour (30 and 401 min) and patients with tumour (30 and 387 min) with no
significant difference (p greater than 0.05) between the two groups. 99Tcm(V)DMSA
had a fast cumulative urine excretion with mean half-times in non-tumour and
tumour patients of 183 min and 244 min respectively. There was no significant
difference (p greater than 0.05) between these two latter groups. The effective
dose equivalent of 99Tcm(V)DMSA in man is 5.1 microSv/MBq.

Two girls (4 and 3-year old) visited our out-patient service complaining of
daytime and nighttime enuresis. Both were diagnosed as ectopic ureteral opening
to the vagina with a concomitant dysplastic kidney on the left side. These
anomalies were repaired by ureterocystoneostomy according to a modified Grégoir's
method. In the first case, three months later, DIP visualized left upper urinary 
tract which had not been seen before, but enhanced CT scan, renogram and
scintigraphy with Tc-DMSA showed no change. In the second case, three years
later, examination results were the same as in the first case. There was no renal
development. Surgical repair of ureterocystoneostomy was valuable, with small
surgical damage and cosmetic merit for the girls. Furthermore, renal function
will be maintained at the same level or slightly higher than that before the
operation.

(1)Department of Urology, Tohoku University School of Medicine.

The function of 99 refluxing kidneys of 61 children up to two years old at the
time of diagnosis was evaluated by 99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy, urinary beta
2-microglobulin (beta 2-MG), alpha 1-microglobulin (alpha 1-MG) and
N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamidase (NAG). High grade reflex (grade IV, V) was found in
45% of the cases. 76%, 51% and 92% of the cases showed abnormally high value of
urinary beta 2-MG, alpha 1-MG and NAG, respectively. These results indicate that 
they have already had tubular dysfunction at the time of diagnosis. DMSA
renoscintigraphy of 82 refluxing kidneys of 49 children was performed. Of these, 
48% had renal scar and 28% had serious renal dysfunction [DMSA uptake rate less
than 18%]. 10-20% of low grade VUR had less than 18% DMSA uptake rate. Two
patterns were noticed in the group in which urinary beta 2-MG ranged 0.33-1.0.
One was characterized by good bilateral renal function with slight tubular damage
and the other serious renal dysfunction with fixed tubular damage. No remarkable 
recovery of the renal function was noticed after antireflux operation in the
second pattern cases. In many cases, in which urinary beta 2-MG was more than

Technetium-99m (99Tcm) (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a new tumour imaging
agent which has been used to evaluate head and neck tumours. It has a normal head
and neck biodistribution to include the lacrimal glands, nasal mucosa and the
blood-pool. Seventy-seven patients were studied of whom 63 had a head and neck
malignancy. Of these patients, 19 (25%) exhibited positive accumulation of
radioactivity in the region of the pituitary gland and this was a constant
finding in those followed-up after treatment. Biodistribution studies in forty
New Zealand white rabbits confirmed pituitary accumulation of 99Tcm (v) DMSA. The
pituitary gland region should be included in the normal biodistribution of 99Tcm 
(v) DMSA.

Determination and metabolism of dithiol chelating agents. VII. Biliary excretion 
of dithiols and their interactions with cadmium and metallothionein.

N-(2,3-Dimercaptopropyl) phthalamidic acid (DMPA), meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA), and 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) are dithiol chelating
agents with antidotal activity for lead, mercury, arsenic, and other heavy
metals. The biliary excretion of these compounds was studied in male
Sprague-Dawley rats. After iv administration of DMPA, 72% of the injected dose
was recovered in the bile. Half of the recovered DMPA was in the unaltered form
(parent compound) and the other half was in the altered form (parent compound
recovered after chemical reduction by DTT). An altered, presumably disulfide,
form of DMPS was found in the bile. Neither unaltered nor altered DMSA was
detected in the bile. DMPA (0.10 mmol/kg), given to rats 3 days after exposure to
Cd, elicited within 30 min a 20-fold increase in biliary Cd excretion. The
increase of biliary Cd by DMPA was dose-related and not due to an increase of
bile flow rate. DMSA and DMPS did not significantly affect the biliary excretion 
of Cd. Incubation of DMPA or DMSA with Cd-saturated metallothionein (MT) resulted
in the removal of Cd from MT. DMPA was more active than DMSA in this respect. The
evidence strongly supports the mechanism that the increase of biliary cadmium
following DMPA administration is the result of DMPA entering cells and mobilizing
and removing the cadmium from MT. The removal of cadmium from metallothionein by 
dithiol chelating agents provides another dimension to their mechanisms of action
and may provide an important new tool for the study of cadmium as well as
metallothionein.

Detection of renal scarring by DMSA scanning--an experimental study.

Arnold AJ(1), Brownless SM, Carty HM, Rickwood AM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital, Liverpool,
England.

Using the established piglet model, renal scars were produced by a combination of
vesicoureteric reflux and urinary infection. The presence and extent of scarring,
as determined by postmortem examination, was compared with that detected by
technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans performed before sacrifice.
Sixty female piglets (62 refluxing units) were studied. Overall the sensitivity
(true-positive/(true-positive + false-negative)) of DMSA scanning in detecting
macroscopic scarring was 85% and the specificity (true-negative/(true-negative + 
false-positive)) was 97%. There were five false-negatives, four of which were in 
kidneys with minor scarring and one in which there was major scarring. There were
three false-positives. We conclude that DMSA scanning has a high specificity and 
sensitivity in detecting renal scars in female piglets, and suggest it is the
preferred method for detecting renal scars in clinical practice.

The effect of rapid converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) with intravenous
enalaprilat on technetium-99m-(99mTc) diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)
and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renograms was evaluated in rats with
two-kidney, one-clip renovascular hypertension. Rapid sequential DTPA renograms, 
performed immediately before and five minutes after enalaprilat injection (30
micrograms/kg), demonstrated a selective decrease in clipped kidney DTPA plasma
clearance following CEI and no significant effect on unclipped kidney function.
Pre- and post-CEI data were obtained with a single injection of DMSA by
administering enalaprilat five minutes after the radiopharmaceutical. Enalaprilat
slowed the rate of DMSA accumulation in clipped relative to unclipped kidneys,
and reduced the clipped/unclipped kidney ratio of absolute DMSA uptake at 10 and 
30 min. DTPA and DMSA were equally effective in demonstrating the CEI effect.
Enalaprilat was also compared with captopril (3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), using 
sequential DTPA renograms. Clipped kidney DTPA plasma clearance was reduced to an
identical degree (40%) by both converting enzyme inhibitors. Clinical renographic
protocols can probably be devised to take advantage of the rapid, reliable CEI of
enalaprilat, thereby shortening total procedure time.

Treatment of acute lead intoxication. A quantitative comparison of a number of
chelating agents.

Llobet JM(1), Domingo JL, Paternain JL, Corbella J.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Toxicology and Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of
Barcelona, Spain.

The efficacy of several chelating agents in alleviating acute lead intoxication
has been investigated in male Swiss mice. The relative effectiveness of
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA),
ethyleneglycolbis-(beta-amino-ethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA),
cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid (CDTA), L-cysteine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC),
ascorbic acid, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) and sodium 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate (DMPS) in reducing lethality 
of lead was examined. Significant increases in survival were noted with CDTA,
ascorbic acid, DMSA, and DMPS. Therapeutic effectiveness (TEF) was determined for
these compounds; TEF for ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and for
2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BAL) was also determined; CDTA (2.33) and EDTA (1.73)
showed the highest values. In subsequent experiments, the effect of the chelating
agents on the distribution and excretion of lead was investigated. Lead acetate
trihydrate was administered subcutaneously at doses of 37.8 mmol/kg (LD50), and
fifteen minutes later, chelators were given intraperitoneally at doses
approximately equal to one-fourth of their respective LD50 values. EDTA, DTPA and
CDTA were the most effective agents in increasing the urinary excretion of lead, 
whereas DTPA, CDTA, and DDC increased significantly the fecal excretion of lead. 
EDTA, DDC, and CDTA were the most effective chelators in reducing the
concentration of lead found in various tissues. On the basis of these results,
CDTA may be considered as an alternative in the treatment of acute lead
poisoning.

A renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA as a function of time and correlation between
99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-DTPA in renal uptake were discussed. The absolute renal
uptake of 99mTc-DMSA calculated by complete correction of tissue attenuation and 
physical decay showed increase by 5 hours after the administration, except one
case with congestive heart failure. The net renal counts attained a maximum
between 2 to 3 hours after the administration. There was a good correlation (r
-0.992, p less than 0.001) between the relative renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA (2
hour) and that of 99mTc-DTPA (2-3 min). On the contrary, the absolute renal
uptake of 99mTc-DMSA as a indicator of total renal function showed a poor
correlation (r = 0.419) to GFR calculated from 99mTc-DTPA. The results indicate
that the relative renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA is a reliable quantitative parameter
for split renal function. However, the absolute renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA may be
suggested to be a different renal functioning indicator from GFR calculated from 
99mTc-DTPA.

99Tcm (v) DMSA: a clinical, planar and SPECT study to evaluate patients with head
and neck squamous carcinoma.

Watkinson JC(1), Lazarus CR, Mistry R, Maisey MN, Clarke SE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Otolaryngology, Guy's Hospital, London, UK.

Technetium-99m (99Tcm) (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a new tumour imaging
agent which has been used to image squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and 
neck. This study was undertaken to compare planar versus SPECT 99Tcm (v) DMSA
scintigraphy in patients with head and neck SCC. Thirty-four patients were
studied. Twenty-eight had SCC, and of these, four had received previous treatment
with surgery or irradiation. SPECT was as sensitive and as accurate as clinical
examination (but more sensitive and accurate than planar scintigraphy) in
detecting which patients had cancer and which patients had primary tumours. SPECT
was more sensitive and more accurate than planar scintigraphy (but less sensitive
and accurate than clinical examination) in detecting lateral neck compartments
with metastatic carcinoma. SPECT correctly upstaged 6% of clinically N0 necks.
Although SPECT 99Tcm (v) DMSA scintigraphy improved the image quality,
sensitivity and spatial resolution of the investigation, it has no role to play
in the routine evaluation of patients with head and neck SCC (to include the
clinically N0 neck).

Technetium-99m (99Tcm) (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a new tumour imaging
agent which has been used to image medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. This study was undertaken to 
compare planar scintigraphy in patients with head and neck SCC using 99Tcm (v)
DMSA and the established tumour imaging agent gallium-67 citrate (67Ga).
Seventeen patients were studied of whom 16 had a head and neck malignancy.
Clinical examination was more sensitive and accurate than 67Ga scintigraphy,
which in turn was more sensitive and accurate than 99Tcm (v) DMSA in detecting
patients with cancer, patients with primary tumours and patients with metastatic 
neck carcinoma. Neither 67Ga or 99Tcm (v) DMSA planar scintigraphy has any role
to play in the routine evaluation at presentation of patients with head and neck 
SCC.

[A study of renal leak of 99mTc-DMSA in maleate-treated rats by factor analysis].

[Article in Japanese]

Koide H(1), Yonekura Y, Konishi J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Kyoto University Hospital,
Japan.

To elucidate renal leak of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) in
maleate-treated rats, plasma amino acid levels and urinary excreted % doses of
99mTc-DMSA and 131I-ortho-iodohippurate (131I-OIH) were studied by factor
analysis. 0.4 m mol of Na-maleate dissolved in 2 ml of saline was
intraperitoneally injected twice at an interval of 20 hours. Four hours later
after second injection, mixture of 99mTc-DMSA and 131I-OIH was injected from tail
vein. Urine was collected 15 minutes later to calculate the excretion ratios.
Then rats were sacrificed by decapitation and blood samples were taken by cardiac
puncture to determine plasma levels of amino acids and their metabolites. Urinary
excreted % doses of 99mTc-DMSA were 10.1 +/- 1.3% in control group (n = 5) and
10.6 +/- 4.9% in maleate-treated group (n = 10). Of the 10 treated rats, only 2
rats showed clearly increased excretion of 99mTc-DMSA (19.1% and 19.4%
respectively and others ranged from 6.2% to 12.0%). Fifteen variables used for
factor analysis consisted of the % doses of two kinds of radiopharmaceuticals and
13 kinds of the data of amino acids analysis. Statistical procedures were as
follows. Varimax rotation was performed, two factors were extracted and factor
scores for each rat were plotted to obtain scattergram. Interpretation of the
results led to a hypothesis that renal leak of 99mTc-DMSA might be relevant to
decreased glutamine metabolism.

Greece.

We evaluated the results of open surgery in 19 children with staghorn calculi.
The median age was 3.5 years (range 10 months to 14 years). One patient had
bilateral calculi, hence 20 renal units were operated upon. Stone clearance was
achieved in 19 cases by means of a Gil-Vernet pyelocalycolithotomy, alone (n =
10) or in combination with limited radial nephrotomies (n = 9). Extended
nephrolithotomy was performed in only 1 case. Complete stone clearance was
achieved in 13 kidneys (65%). Long-term follow-up showed that there was no stone 
recurrence in any of the 13 renal units rendered completely stone free at
surgery. There was symptomatic stone recurrence in 1 of the remaining 7 renal
units with small residual fragments left behind, while in 2 others the residual
fragments were voided spontaneously. Preoperative and postoperative assessment
with 99mTc-DMSA renal scans confirmed that no functional loss resulted in any of 
the operated kidneys. Open surgery proved to be safe and effective in the
treatment of staghorn calculi in children.

Distribution of renal parenchymal damage on 99m-Tc DMSA scintigraphy in
vesico-ureteric reflux.

Kullendorff CM(1), Evander E.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatric Surgery, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.

During a 2 year period renal scintigraphy was performed in 64 children prior to
surgery for vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). In total 126 kidneys were examined.
Renal scintigraphy was performed 3 hours after intravenous injection of
99m-technetium labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The renal parenchyma was 
assessed as normal in 64 kidneys and abnormal in 62. Renal parenchymal damage was
revealed in the upper pole in 42 cases, the middle lateral part in 27, the lower 
pole in 47 and the middle medial part in 25. The whole kidney was affected in 21 
cases. Damage within one or two poles was present in 59 of the 62 kidneys with
parenchymal damage. Renal scintigraphy is regarded a sensitive technique for
detection of renal parenchymal damage. The DMSA scintigraphy can reveal even
minor scars. It can be recommended as a routine investigation in evaluating
children with VUR.

Effects of oral meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) administration on late
gestation and postnatal development in the mouse.

Domingo JL(1), Bosque MA, Corbella J.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Toxicology and Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Reus, Spain.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on late gestation and postnatal viability
and growth in the mouse. DMSA was given po to four groups of pregnant Swiss mice 
at 0, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg/day from day 14 of pregnancy until postnatal day
21. At birth, the following data were recorded: length of gestation, number of
live, dead, and abnormal pups, sex, and individual pup weights. Each pup was
weighed again on day 4, 14, and 21 of lactation. Pinna detachment, incisor
eruption and eye opening were also monitored. No treatment-related signs of
toxicity were noted in any of the dams during the study. No adverse effects on
offspring survival or development were evident in the 200 or 400 mg DMSA/kg/day
groups. However, on days 14 and 21 of lactation a significant decrease in pup
body weight was observed in the 800 mg/kg/day group. Also, a significant increase
in the relative weight of the brain was seen in this group. The "no observable
effect level" (NOEL) for health hazards to the developing pup was greater than
400 mg/kg/day. This dose is higher than the amounts of DMSA usually given in the 
treatment of human heavy metal intoxications.

This study reports the results of renal DMSA isotope scan before and after EDAP
extracorporeal lithotripsy in 106 patients. An isotope scan was performed before 
lithotripsy and on the fourth day after lithotripsy and again on the 90th day
when alterations were observed on the first post-lithotripsy scan. The assessment
of any sequelae was based on the scale of colours of the spectrum, which revealed
three types of modifications. The analysis of the results is divided into three
periods according to the development in our lithotripsy technique: high firing
rates had a success rate of only 40%, with renal scars on isotope scans in 2/3 of
cases; low frequency firing rates had a 55% success rate and induced minor
changes which were virtually always reversible; in contrast, low frequency firing
rates during the 3rd period had a 60% success rate with scars on isotope scans in
1/3 of cases. These isotope scan modifications also depended on the site of the
stone. In conclusion, lithotripsy definitely induces renal modifications. The
renal parenchyma cannot remain indifferent to lithotripsy beyond a certain
threshold. A homogeneous multicentre study with a common protocol is necessary to
compare the various lithotriptors and to define cautious and coherent indications
for each lithotriptor in the treatment of renal stones.

24 children with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) underwent
systematically ultrasound studies (US) and 99mTc-DMSA renal scans. Among the 15
patients considered as acute pyelonephritis (APN) on clinical grounds, the scan
was abnormal in 12 cases, in contrast with only 1 abnormal scan in the clinical
subgroup of the lower UTI. Among the 10 abnormal scans that were repeated later
on, 6 did completely normalize. US showed only once a parenchymal appearance
suggestive for APN. Our findings suggest that the DMSA scan has to be considered 
at present as the most sensitive imaging technique for the detection of APN.

München, FRG.

The efficacy of DL-dimercaptopropanol (British Anti-Lewisite, BAL),
DL-dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS), and meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was
compared in reducing the acute As2O3 toxicity in mice. Mice were treated with a
single equimolar dose of a dithiol compound (0.7 mmol/kg i.p.) 0.5 or 30 min
after the s.c. injection of various doses of As2O3. Both DMPS and DMSA were
significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) more effective in mice treated 0.5
min after the poisoning if compared to BAL on an equimolar level. The highest
potency ratio (PR) (LD50 with treatment/LD50 without treatment) was found in
animals injected with DMSA (PR = 8.6). The corresponding value for DMPS was 4.2, 
and for BAL 2.1, respectively. In animals treated 30 min after poisoning the
efficacy of DMPS (PR = 2.6) was similar to the efficacy of DMSA 2.4, both being
only slightly superior to BAL 2.0. DMPS and DMSA were found to be much less toxic
than BAL. The LD50 of arsenic was 0.057 mmol/kg. The efficacy of BAL, DMPS, and
DMSA in reducing the tissue content of arsenic following acute As2O3 poisoning
was investigated in mice (n = 6/group) and guinea pigs (n = 3-4/group). The
animals were injected s.c. with 0.043 mmol/kg As2O3 (containing a tracer dose of 
74As(III)). Thirty minutes later the antidotes were administered i.p. (0.7
mmol/kg). From 2 to 4 h after As2O3 poisoning bile was collected from guinea
pigs. Four h after As2O3 injection the content of 74As in blood, liver, kidneys, 
spleen, heart, lungs, brain, testes, skeletal muscle, and skin in mice and guinea
pigs was measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Methods for measuring the renal uptake rate of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA): a comparative study.

Murase K(1), Tanada S, Ishine M, Yokoyama M, Hamamoto K.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Ehime University School of Medicine, Japan.

A comparative study of the renal uptake rate of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) was performed using a phantom study and clinical data from 100 patients
(200 kidneys) with a variety of renal diseases. The measurement methods for renal
uptake rate studied here include a posterior-view method, a conjugate-view
method, and a method using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
The renal uptake rates obtained by the posterior-view method significantly (P
less than 0.001) depended on kidney depth correction. With the SPECT method, the 
cut-off level for delineating the kidney was changed according to the background 
count ratio using the results of the phantom study. The renal uptake rates
obtained by the SPECT method correlated significantly (P less than 0.001) with
those obtained by other methods, and there were no significant differences as
compared with those obtained by the conjugate-view method. An analysis of error
with the above methods indicated that the error relating to the sensitivity to
body thickness was smallest for the SPECT method and greatest for the
posterior-view method. In terms of measurement of renal uptake rate only, the
conjugate-view method is considered the most useful because it needs no kidney
depth correction and requires very little additional effort or examination time.

meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid: chemical, pharmacological and toxicological
properties of an orally effective metal chelating agent.

Aposhian HV(1), Aposhian MM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson
85721.

The primary purpose of this article is to summarize the recent investigations
dealing with the pharmacology and toxicology of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid,
an orally effective chelating agent. The need for a better chelating agent for
treating young children and pregnant women with lead intoxication has been
apparent for some time. Preclinical and clinical evidence now indicate that
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, an Orphan Drug, shows the most promise for
being effective in this regard. It has an extracellular distribution that may be 
responsible for its low toxicity compared to other dithiols. No attempt has been 
made to compare it in a rigorous and thorough manner with other chelating agents.
That has not been the purpose of this review. The advantages of meso-DMSA,
however, compared to CaNa2EDTA for the treatment of lead intoxication, have been 
outlined. Significant advances have been made recently in elucidating the
structures of the metal chelates of DMSA. There is a striking difference between 
the structures of the lead chelate of meso-DMSA and those of racemic-DMSA. The
former chelates by coordination of one sulfur and one oxygen atom with Pb. The
latter can form chelates via the two sulfur atoms or via one oxygen and one
sulfur atom. Solubility of the lead chelates depends on the ionization of the
noncoordinated thiol and carboxylic acid groups. Bimane derivatization, HPLC, and
fluorescence, as well as gas chromatography can be used for analysis of DMSA in
biological fluids. The acid dissociation constants for meso- and racemic-DMSA
have been summarized from the literature as have the formation constants of some 
of the DMSA chelates. DMSA is biotransformed to a mixed disulfide in humans. By
14 hr after DMSA administration (10 mg/kg), only 2.5% of the administered DMSA is
excreted in the urine as unaltered DMSA and 18.1% of the dose is found in the
urine as altered forms of DMSA. Most altered DMSA in the urine is in the form of 
a mixed disulfide. It consists of DMSA in disulfide linkages with two molecules
of L-cysteine. One molecule of cysteine is attached to each of the sulfur atoms
of DMSA. The remaining 10% of the altered DMSA was in the form of cyclic
disulfides of DMSA. So far, the mixed disulfide has been found in human but not
in rabbit, mouse, or rat urine. Apparently there are species differences in how
organisms metabolize meso-DMSA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Initial effect of enalapril on kidney function in patients with moderate to
severe chronic nephropathy.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been suggested to halt the
progression of chronic renal failure. As the initial step of a controlled trial
of this hypothesis, it was investigated whether start of enalapril in patients
with severe chronic nephropathy might cause a critical fall in their renal
function. Thirty-one patients were studied, 26 on chronic antihypertensive
treatment with drugs other than ACE inhibitors and 5 untreated normotensive.
51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance and renal technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc-DMSA) scintigraphy were made before and 24 h after start of enalapril,
mean dose 9 mg. Blood pressure fell from median 148/88 to 119/78 mmHg (p less
than 0.01). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) fell from median 14 to 12
ml/min/1.73 m2 (p less than 0.01). The median change in GFR was -14% (range -44% 
to +10%). The split renal function was unchanged and the scintigrams showed no
intrarenal activity defects. In conclusion, enalapril caused a fall in GFR, which
was clinically acceptable in most of the patients.

32 children admitted to Hacettepe University Hospital for surgical treatment of
vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) between 1987 and 1988 were included in this
prospective double-blind study. All patients underwent intravenous urography
(IVU), voiding cystouretrography and 99mTc DMSA renal scanning. The sensitivity
and specificity of the DMSA scan and IVU for detecting renal scarring were
investigated. With regard to the presence of renal scarring, the sensitivity and 
specificity of IVU and DMSA were not found to be statistically different. But
when the scars were scored, DMSA was found to have a higher scoring index
compared to IVU. In patients who were candidates for surgical management of VUR, 
renal scars could be detected both by IVU and DMSA scan but, for the follow-up,
the DMSA scan was found to be the investigation of choice.

Scintigraphic evaluation of glomus tumours.

Rockall TA(1), Watkinson JC, Clark SE, Douek EE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Otolaryngology, Guys Hospital, London.

The current investigations of choice for a suspected glomus tumour are either
direct or indirect angiography to include digital subtraction followed by
computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or, if
available, CT and MRI with gadolinium alone. Although these modalities confirm
the diagnosis and give anatomical information to facilitate accurate staging,
they do not provide functional data. The use of radionuclide scintigraphy can add
an extra physiological dimension to glomus tumour imaging. Iodine-131/123
metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a tumour imaging agent which has been used to
diagnose head and neck neuroendocrine tumours to include paragangliomata and
medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MCT). However, it is expensive and the new
head and neck tumour imaging agent technetium-99 m (Tc99m) (v) dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) has superceded it as the imaging agent of choice to evaluate MCT. We 
report a patient with a glomus jugulare tumour which was evaluated with
I131/I123-MIBG and Tc99m (v) DMSA. The tumour was functional and is the first
reported case exhibiting positive accumulation of both I131-MIBG and Tc99m (v)
DMSA. The patient was subsequently treated with a therapeutic dose of I131-MIBG. 
The significance of these results is discussed.

Renal uptake of dimercaptosuccinic acid and glomerular filtration rate in chronic
nephropathy at angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.

Kamper AL(1), Thomsen HS, Nielsen SL, Strandgaard S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nephrology, Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal uptake of dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) were measured in 31 patients with progressive chronic nephropathy before
and immediately after the start of treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitor in order to control adverse effects on kidney function.
Scintigrams of the kidneys showed an unaltered distribution of DMSA during
treatment. GFR estimated by 51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance fell by 14% (P less than
0.01), but renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA increased by 10% (P less than 0.01). It is 
concluded that DMSA in chronic renal failure is mainly taken up by the tubular
cells from the peritubular capillaries since the uptake was unaffected by the
acute decrease in GFR.

A kinetic model for 99mTc-DMSA in the rat.

Maneval DC(1), D'Argenio DZ, Wolf W.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los
Angeles 90089-1451.

A pharmacokinetic model was developed for the renal imaging agent 99mTc-DMSA in
anesthetized rats, which incorporated data from serial measurements of blood and 
urine simultaneously with dynamic images obtained over an 8-h period. Animals
which received a 10 mg/kg dose of unlabeled DMSA immediately before 99mTc-DMSA
injection had a significantly reduced kidney accumulation and greater urinary
elimination of 99mTc than animals which received the radiopharmaceutical alone.
The kidney clearance was also significantly lower in rats receiving unlabeled
DMSA, but no significant difference was determined between the urine clearance
estimates of the two animal groups. Because the increase in the amount eliminated
in the urine was not coupled with a significant change in urine clearance, it
would appear that unlabeled DMSA saturated the kidney uptake mechanism(s) of
99mTc-DMSA without modifying the urinary clearance process. This interpretation
is consistent with the hypothesis that renal handling of 99mTc-DMSA is governed
by both glomerular filtration and peritubular capillary uptake. The simultaneous 
acquisition of blood, urine and non invasive image data allows for a
comprehensive and informative model of the physiological disposition of
99mTc-DMSA.

99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy was carried out in 54 patients with unilateral
renal stones before and after PNL. Four to 8 weeks after PNL the DMSA renal
uptake significantly decreased to 17.2 +/- 6.0% from 18.2 +/- 6.7% before PNL.
DMSA renal uptake did not change in the contralateral side. Since in some
patients changes in the DMSA renal uptake of 5-7% were observed after PNL not
only in the PNL side but also in the contralateral side, the renal function was
assessed by the formula: DMSA renal uptake in the PNL side/DMSA renal uptake in
the contralateral side, and the change of this ratio was evaluated in 44
patients, in whom the renal DMSA uptake in the PNL side was less than two times
that in the contralateral side. The DMSA renal uptake ratio decreased to 95.6 +/-
8.7% from the base line 4-8 weeks after PNL. This change was statistically
significant. Some functional risks such as massive bleeding with PNL, the fever
after PNL and the number of nephrostomy tract did not affect the decrease in the 
renal function. In 29 patients in whom renal function was reevaluated one year
after PNL, the DMSA renal uptake ratio significantly decreased to 94.2 +/- 9.6%
from the base line 4-8 weeks after PNL. But the ratio significantly improved to
99.6 +/- 11.6% about one year after PNL. In two patients with a cold area on the 
renal image, the renal function of the operated side still remained at about 80% 
levels from the base line even one year after PNL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

Synthesis and biological characteristics of the four stereoisomers of
99mTc-N,N'-bis-(mercaptoacetyl)-2,3-diaminopropanoate.

Sciences, K. U. Leuven, Belgium.

To study the differences in biological behaviour between the four stereoisomers
of 99mTc-CO2-DADS we synthesized both the L- and D-isomer of
N,N'-bis-(benzoylmercaptoacetyl)-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid ethyl ester. The N2S2 
ligands were labelled with 99mTc by the dithionite reduction method in alkaline
medium to hydrolyze the ester function. Each isomer yielded two diastereomeric
99mTc-complexes, that were separated by RP-HPLC to finally obtain the four
isomers of 99mTc-CO2-DADS. The biodistribution of the isomers was determined in
mice and a baboon. The study in mice indicates that only the LB-isomer is
responsible for the high liver uptake reported for (DL)-99mTc-CO2-DADS-B
(Fritzberg et al. J. Nucl. Med. 23, 592-598, 1982). The rate of renal extraction 
and hepatobiliary excretion of the three other isomers is comparable to that of
[131I]o-I-hippurate. Baboon renograms for the LA- and DA-isomers are similar to
that of [123I]o-I-hippurate. The renogram of the DB-isomer resembles more the
99mTc-DTPA renogram, whereas the LB-isomer exhibits a 99mTc-DMSA-like renal
build-up. It appears that minor configurational changes can drastically alter the
renal handling of these bisamide bisthiol 99mTc-tracer agents.

N-(2,3-dimercaptopropyl)phthalamidic acid (DMPA) increases polonium-210
excretion.

Polonium-210 is one of the most hazardous radionuclides. As recently as 1988,
there have been concerns regarding accidental exposures of humans to it. Yet,
there have been no studies on the effectiveness of the newer dithiol chelating
agents in increasing the excretion of this radioactive heavy metal. In order to
accomplish this, a safe and effective method for determining the radioactivity of
polonium-210, an alpha emitter, in the feces was developed. The excretion of
polonium-210 was studied by giving male Sprague-Dawley rats 210Po (3.33 x 10(7)
cpm/kg, intraperitoneal); 1 h later they were given either 5% sodium bicarbonate,
N-(2,3-dimercaptopropyl)phthalamidic acid (DMPA) or meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA) (0.20 mmol/kg, subcutaneous). Treatment was repeated daily for 12 days.
DMPA and DMSA increased the urinary excretion of 210Po, as compared to control
animals, 8-fold and 5-fold, respectively. DMPA increased the fecal excretion of
210Po compared to the other treatments and also decreased the level of 210Po in
the spleen, a radiosensitive organ. DMPA (0.20 mmol/kg, intravenous) increased
biliary levels of 210Po 5-fold compared to controls. The results indicate that
DMPA has greater specificity in chelating and increasing the excretion of 210Po
than DMSA.

[Clinical research on congenital hydronephrosis--significance and indication of
the preliminary nephrostomy].

[Article in Japanese]

Kitamura Y.

Clinical data of 31 patients (34 renal units) with severe congenital
hydronephrosis who had received preliminary nephrostomy were reviewed to survey
functional recovery of the kidneys and the significance of preliminary
nephrostomy. The results were as follows: 1. In most cases, the renal function
based on Ccr and 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy after nephrostomy could not
improve beyond preoperative one. 2. A close linear correction was found between
the thickness of renal parenchyma before preliminary nephrostomy and the renal
function after the nephrostomy. 3. Preliminary nephrostomy is indicated for
severe hydronephrosis in neonates and infants, obstruction of the lower ureter,
and serious general condition, which need accurate split renal function, and for 
patients without accurate diagnosis.

Lead chelates of meso- and racemic-dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Rivera M(1), Aposhian HV, Fernando Q.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Arizona, Tuscon 85721.

Lead chelates of racemic- and meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were
synthesized and isolated from aqueous solutions and characterized by
potentiometric measurements and infrared spectroscopy. Two types of lead chelates
of racemic DMSA were isolated: one in which racemic-DMSA is coordinated to Pb+2
via one oxygen and one sulfur atom and the other in which the Pb2+ is coordinated
via two sulfur atoms. The latter form of the chelate is converted into the former
upon dissolution in dimethylsulfoxide. Only one type of Pb2+ chelate of the meso 
form of the ligand was formed. In this case, meso-DMSA is coordinated to Pb+2 via
one oxygen and one sulfur atom. Meso- and racemic-DMSA have very different
solubilities in aqueous solutions. Meso-DMSA is slightly soluble in water,
whereas racemic-DMSA is very soluble in water even in the presence of strong
acids. The solubilities of the chelates were found to be pH dependent. When the
uncoordinated sulfhydryl and carboxylic acid groups dissociate, the chelates
dissolve and remain in aqueous solution. The infrared spectra of meso- and
racemic-DMSA show distinct features that can be used to detect the presence of
either diastereoisomer.

99Tcm(v)-DMSA planar scintigraphy: does it have a role in the management of
patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma?

Watkinson JC(1), Lazarus CR, Maisey MN, Clarke SE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Otolaryngology, Guy's Hospital, London, UK.

99Tcm(v)-DMSA is a new tumour-imaging agent which has recently been proposed as a
scintigraphic marker for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
Seventy-seven patients were studied prospectively, of whom 58 had a history and
diagnosis of head and neck SCC. All patients were examined, imaged using
99Tcm(v)-DMSA planar scintigraphy and then followed up clinically. In addition,
35 patients were followed up with scintigraphy (81 studies). Scintigraphy was
less sensitive and less accurate than clinical examination for the overall
detection of patients with SCC, for the detection of patients with SCC at
presentation and for the detection of patients with primary tumours, possible
nodal disease and with residual and recurrent disease following surgery and
irradiation. Approximately 50% of patients exhibited positive uptake of
99Tcm(v)-DMSA in the salivary glands following radiotherapy. Although
99Tcm(v)-DMSA is accumulated at sites of head and neck SCC, its inability to
detect low volume disease and apparent low specificity following surgery and
irradiation means it has no role to play in the routine evaluation of patients
with head and neck SCC.

Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid: management of persistent hypercalcitonaemia
utilizing [99mTc] (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Surgery, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, UK.

Whole body scintigraphy with [99mTc] (v)dimercaptosuccinic acid (pentavalent
DMSA) was performed in seven patients with histologically confirmed medullary
carcinoma of the thyroid (MCT). Six of these patients had undergone previous
thyroid resections for MCT and, although asymptomatic at the time of pentavalent 
DMSA scintigraphy, had persistent and serial elevations in their plasma
calcitonin levels. One additional patient was scanned before and after total
thyroidectomy for MCT. The pentavalent DMSA scintigram demonstrated either local 
neck recurrence (three patients) or distant metastases (two patients) in five of 
the six asymptomatic patients. In one asymptomatic patient only equivocal neck
uptake was demonstrated. Since he had only minimal calcitonin elevations, repeat 
neck exploration was not performed. The one patient studied before thyroid
resection for MCT demonstrated neck uptake before, but not after, total
thyroidectomy. The results of the scintigrams had significant impact on patient
care and resulted in neck re-exploration (three patients), neck biopsy (one
patient), and lumbar spine biopsy and subsequent radiotherapy (one patient).
These data demonstrate pentavalent DMSA to be a sensitive localizing agent in the
evaluation of asymptomatic MCT patients with hypercalcitonaemia. Accurate
targeting of treatment may be shown in due course to have a beneficial impact on 
survival.

Sweden.

Partial obstruction of the left ureter was created in two-day-old rats and its
effects on kidney function were studied with 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-DTPA after one,
two, three and six weeks, and after one year. Kidneys from animals sacrificed at 
the age of six weeks or one year were also examined histologically. The
obstructed renal pelvis was enlarged by about 35 times and there was a delayed
excretion of 99mTc-DTPA during forced diuresis, indicating significant, chronic
obstruction. The renal DMSA-uptake ratio (left kidney/(left and right kidney] was
reduced to about 40% from the first week of obstruction. The parenchymal weight
ratio (expressed as above) was reduced to about 45% after both six weeks and one 
year. The glomerular filtration rate, examined during forced diuresis and
calculated on the basis of uptake capacity, was lowered to 42% after six weeks
but was not significantly reduced after one year of obstruction. The incidence
figures for medullary hemorrhage or accumulation of iron pigment, and chronic
inflammatory changes in the cortex were somewhat higher after one year of
obstruction than after 6 weeks, but the lesions were patchy in both groups. We
conclude that partial unilateral ureteric obstruction, created in the neonatal
period, leads to a slight but permanent functional disturbance and parenchymal
weight reduction without prominent structural parenchymal damage.

A prospective study to detect renal artery thrombosis by radionuclide renal
scintigraphy in newborn infants who underwent umbilical arterial catheterization 
over a one year period was done: 62 babies were catheterized, 92% were preterm
and 85% had severe respiratory distress syndrome that required mechanical
ventilation, 25/62 (40.3%) survived and in all of them Tc-99m DMSA scans were
taken at a median of 5 days after withdrawal of the umbilical artery catheters
(range 9 h to 29 days). A baby with renovascular hypertension had a DMSA scan
which showed segmental vascular defect in one kidney. Another patient had left
iliac artery thrombosis and two others showed evidence of transient vasospasm.
Death occurred in 37/62 (59.7%), 92% of whom underwent autopsy studies which
showed aortoiliac thrombosis in 8.8%, all of them without clinical symptoms.
Other 12 newborn infants who died without previous umbilical artery
catheterization had no evidence of thrombosis at autopsy.

Efficacy of calcium disodium EDTA, D-penicillamine (DPA), 2,3 dimercaptosuccinic 
acid (DMSA), and alpha-mercapto-beta-(2-furyl) acrylic acid (MFA) to reduce the
body burden of lead and restore the altered biochemical variables in lead or lead
+ ethanol administered rats was investigated. The investigation was aimed to
suggest suitable prophylaxis of lead intoxication prevalent among workers
co-exposed to lead and alcohol ingestion. Administration of lead (10 mg/kg, oral,
once daily for 8 weeks) produced a significant inhibition in the activity of
blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), elevation in the blood zinc
protoporphyrin (ZPP) and urinary elimination of lead and delta-aminolevulinic
acid (ALA). Lead contents of blood, liver, kidney and brain were also
significantly higher than the normal control. The above changes were more marked 
in animals co-exposed to lead + ethanol (20% in drinking water) compared to lead 
alone. All the chelators were effective in increasing the urinary lead
elimination, reducing the above biochemical alterations and lead contents of
tissues. The order of effectiveness being DMSA greater than Calcium disodium EDTA
greater than DPA greater than MFA. However, the protection was more noticeable in
animals treated with lead alone than with lead and ethanol.

Serial 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans after urinary infections
presenting before the age of 5 years.

Verber IG(1), Meller ST.

Author information: 
(1)Queen Mary's Hospital for Children, Carshalton Hospital, Sutton.

Forty five children presenting with a first proven urinary tract infection under 
the age of 5 years were studied by sequential 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) scans. Forty nine kidneys in 40 children had definite defects at
presentation, and 39 (80%) of these defects were still present when the DMSA scan
was repeated. Changes in the appearance of defects were independent of the
presence or degree of reflux at presentation and of symptomatic recurrence of
infection, though the combination of new infection and grade 3 reflux (reflux
reaching the renal calices with distension) was associated with deterioration. No
kidney with a relative DMSA uptake of less than 35% showed any improvement in its
cortical defects. Only two kidneys that were initially without defects, in a
single patient who had bilateral grade 3 reflux and breakthrough infections,
developed defects on subsequent scans. The outcome after urinary tract infection 
is dependent on the effect of the first infection on the kidney. Occasionally
children with grade 3 reflux develop damage during subsequent infections. More
widespread use of DMSA scans should improve our understanding of the factors that
determine the development of renal damage.

Between 1985 and 1987 102 children, age 0-14 years, presented with a first acute 
symptomatic E. coli urinary tract infection. Investigations included early
99mtechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan (which was performed at a
median of 27 days), ultrasonography, micturating cysto-urethrography and indirect
voiding radionuclide cystography using 99mTc DTPA. Follow-up DMSA scan was
carried out after 6 months. Twenty-one of 102 of initial DMSA studies showed
diminished uptake of radionuclide and 12 showed cortical scarring. Twenty-nine
patients had significant vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The finding of diminished
uptake on the initial scan was significantly associated with fever, systemic
upset, length of symptoms and a peripheral blood leucocytosis, (p less than
0.05). In addition the finding was associated with fever and loin pain in the
older child. Both diminished uptake and scarring were more common in refluxing
kidney units. We propose that, in children with UTI, diminished uptake on early
DMSA scan localises infection in the renal parenchyma.

[Investigation of factors affecting the progression of polycystic kidney disease 
and effects of percutaneous reduction of cystic size].

[Article in Japanese]

Fukuzaki A, Numata I, Orikasa S.

Factors affecting the progression of autosomal dominant adult type polycystic
kidney disease were analysed in 27 cases. The patients ages ranged from 10 to 74 
(mean 44) years old and the serum creatinine values were within the normal limits
except two cases, in which the values were 2.4 mg/dl and 2.1. They were followed 
for from 2 years to 12 years (mean 5.6 years). During the followup period, 6
cases showed elevation of the serum creatinine values and hemodialysis was
necessary in 4 cases. There was a tendency of higher morbidity rate of
hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria and pyuria in the cases with decreased renal
function. These factors may have participated in the progression of polycystic
kidney disease. Cystic fluid analysis was performed by percutaneous puncture of
more than hundred cysts in 27 cases. The results showed that the cystic fluid
components of most cysts of the well functioning kidneys were similar to those of
serum values: so-called proximal cysts. On the other hand, in the cases with
decreased renal function, there were many cysts with lower sodium concentration
and higher creatinine values: so-called distal cysts. The results suggest that
the existence of so-called distal cysts may indicate poorer prognosis. DMSA
renoscintigraphy was useful for followup polycystic kidney patients because of
the uptake of the radionuclide was decreased before rising the serum creatinine
value. In 6 cases, the cysts were instilled with 95% ethanol. Followup
ultrasonography and DMSA renoscintigraphy revealed a marked reduction of the
cystic size and an improvement of DMSA uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

We studied two different methods for the evaluation of differential renal
function in a group of 100 patients with various kidney disorders whose effective
renal plasma flow (ERPF) had been calculated previously by single
125I-orthoiodohippurate (OIH) injection and multiple blood sampling. Patients
were divided into three groups according to their ERPF:ERPF is greater than or
equal to 250 ml min-1; ERPF less than or equal to 100 ml min-1; and ERPF greater 
than 100 ml min-1 and less than 250 ml min-1. The two methods used to assess
differential renal function were: first, relative 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) uptake calculated by normalized background and attenuation corrected
cumulative counts in each kidney 24 h p.i.; and second, relative
99Tcm-mercaptoacetyl-triglycine (MAG3) uptake within 1 and 2 min p.i. calculated 
by normalized background and attenuation corrected counts on each renal area. The
results obtained with each method correlated strongly with high significance (p
less than 0.0001). In the right kidney, mean values obtained with 99Tcm-MAG3 tend
to be higher than mean values obtained with 99Tcm-DMSA.

What is the optimal imaging time for 99Tcm-(V)-DMSA planar scintigraphy in the
detection of squamous carcinoma? A comparative study in humans and in an animal
tumour model.

99Tcm-(V)-DMSA is a new tumour imaging agent which has been used to image
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. There have been, however, no 
studies to date evaluating its optimal imaging time for SCC. Seven patients were 
studied (six SCC; one nontumour) and seven rabbits (six with SCC, (17 tumours);
one nontumour). For the human qualitative studies there was a 67% sensitivity at 
2, 4 and 6 h with image quality being optimum at 4 h. Maximum quantitative uptake
occurred between 2 and 4 h. For the rabbit qualitative studies the optimum
imaging time was 4 h (92% sensitivity, 100% specificity) and maximum quantitative
uptake occurred at between 1.5 and 5 h. Taking into account the human and rabbit 
qualitative and quantitative studies combined with the pharmacokinetics and
biodistribution of 99Tcm-(V)-DMSA, the optimum imaging time of 99Tcm-(V)-DMSA in 
humans with SCC was between 2 and 4 h.

British antilewisite (2,3-dimercaptopropanol; BAL) has long been used as an
arsenic antidote, but its therapeutic efficacy is limited by its inherent
toxicity. We synthesized two less toxic derivatives of BAL and investigated their
potential as antidotes to organic arsenic. The new compounds,
2,3-dithioerythritol (DTE) and 2,2-dimethyl-4-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-dithiolane
(isopropylidene derivative of BAL), react readily with phenyldichloroarsine (PDA)
to yield the expected corresponding cyclic 1,3-dithioarsolanes. The BAL
derivatives were compared to BAL in terms of their cytotoxicity and their ability
to rescue PDA-poisoned mouse lymphoma cells in culture. The dithiolane was not a 
good antidote in the cultured cell system. In contrast, DTE was less toxic than
BAL or DMSA and was superior at improving cell survival in PDA-exposed cells.

The biological fate of 14C-dimercaptosuccinic acid in monkeys and rabbits.

Tillotson JA, Boswell G, Kincannon L, Speckman CL.

The biological fate of 14C-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in monkeys and 
rabbits was determined by measuring the 14C activity in their urine, feces, and
expired air (14CO2). Monkeys absorbed less than 20% DMSA from three oral dose
levels (0.082, 0.16, and 0.5 mmol/kg) of 14C-DMSA, and the rabbits absorbed 32%
DMSA or less from an oral dose of 14C-DMSA (0.5 mmol/kg). Although the
bioavailability of DMSA was limited in either species, DMSA was detected in the
blood of both species within minutes after oral dosing. In either species, most
of the radiolabel from the absorbed 14C-DMSA was detected in the urine within 12 
hours. We also developed a sensitive assay for directly measuring levels of DMSA 
(as free thiols) in blood. Intact DMSA was not detected in the blood of the
monkeys or the rabbits more than 200 minutes after oral or intravenous dosing at 
0.5 mmol DMSA/kg body weight. However, 14C activity in blood and urine of the
monkeys was measurable 72 hours after this dose. Differences between measured 14C
concentrations and intact DMSA concentrations in the blood suggest the presence
of DMSA metabolites that have longer half-lives than DMSA. Consequently, until
the biological activities of these compounds are identified, the pharmacokinetic 
analysis of DMSA may be incomplete.

Control of nephrotoxicity in the rat during repeated cis-platinum treatments.

Jones MM(1), Basinger MA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37235.

The nephrotoxicity of cis-platinum (CDDP) in the rat can be controlled throughout
a series of weekly administrations of CDDP (each of 5 mg kg-1, i.v.) for at least
three weeks by a combination of protective measures involving pretreatment with
dithiocarbamates and diuretics and the administration of appropriate
dithiocarbamates given 1 h after the CDDP. The use of dithiocarbamates with polar
substitutents is effective in removing both renal and hepatic deposits of
platinum from rats subsequent to its administration and in this respect these
compounds are significantly superior to meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
in the rate at which platinum is removed and in the amounts removed. The most
effective of the dithiocarbamates remove ca. 70% of the platinum from the kidneys
and the liver; the least effective remove ca. 50% of the platinum from these
organs when given at a level of 1.57 mmol kg-1 i.p. for 6 days subsequent to the 
administration of CDDP. Acetazolamide was shown to be much less effective in
preventing renal damage than the dithiocarbamates and was not effective in
reducing renal or hepatic levels of platinum. Pretreatment with sodium
diethyldithiocarbamate 12 h prior to the administration of the CDDP was more
effective in preventing renal damage than the administration of this compound 30 
min before the cis-platinum. Several dithiocarbamates are found to be superior to
sodium diethyldithiocarbamate in reducing renal platinum burdens of rats given
CDDP at the level of 6 mg kg-1, and dose-response curves for the removal of renal
and hepatic platinum were determined for sodium N-methyl-D-glucamine
dithiocarbamate (NaG).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Nitrate reductase of Escherichia coli: completion of the nucleotide sequence of
the nar operon and reassessment of the role of the alpha and beta subunits in
iron binding and electron transfer.

Blasco F(1), Iobbi C, Giordano G, Chippaux M, Bonnefoy V.

Author information: 
(1)Groupe de biomembranes, L.C.B. UER de Luminy, Marseille, France.

The nucleotide sequence of the narGHJI operon that encodes the nitrate reductase 
of Escherichia coli was completed. It encodes four polypeptides NarG, NarH, NarJ 
and NarI of molecular weight 138.7, 57.7, 26.5 and 25.5 kDa, respectively. The
analysis of deduced amino acid sequence failed to reveal any structure capable of
binding iron within the NarG polypeptide. In contrast, cysteine arrangements
typical of iron-sulfur centers were found in the NarH polypeptide. This suggested
that the latter is an electron transfer unit of the nitrate reductase complex.
Such a view is opposite to the current description of the nitrate reductase. The 
findings allowed us to propose a model for the electron transfer steps that occur
during nitrate reduction. The NarG polypeptide was found to display a high degree
of homology with numerous E. coli molybdoproteins. Moreover, the same genetic and
functional organizations as well as the presence of highly conserved stretches of
amino acids were noted between both NarG/NarH and DmsA/DmsB (encoding the
dimethyl sulfoxide reductase) pairs.

Analogy between tumor uptake of technetium(V)-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) 
and technetium-99m-MDP.

Wulfrank DA(1), Schelstraete KH, Small F, Fallais CJ.

Belgium.

Sixty patients with a variety of malignant tumors were examined with Tc-99m(V)
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) prepared by modification of a commercially
available DMSA kit. Significant uptake of Tc-99m(V)-DMSA was observed in a number
of tumors, offering additional clinically useful information. In the majority of 
cases in this study, however, the benefit of the Tc-99m(V)-DMSA image was limited
because of low sensitivity. The most striking observation was the similarity
between the tumor concentration of Tc-99m(V)-DMSA and the Tc-99m-MDP uptake in
the tumor on the regular bone image. Therefore, patients with Tc-99m-MDP uptake
in nonosseous tumor sites on the bone scan may be suitable candidates for tumor
imaging with Tc-99m(V)-DMSA.

Determination and metabolism of dithiol chelating agents. VIII. Metal complexes
of meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Rivera M(1), Zheng W, Aposhian HV, Fernando Q.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721.

Metal complexes of meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) with Pb2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ 
were studied by potentiometric and infrared methods. This dimercapto
metal-binding agent was found to form complexes whose structures are dependent on
the metal ion to be complexed. In the cases of Pb2+ and Cd2+, one oxygen and one 
sulfur act as the donor atoms; in the case of Hg2+, two sulfur atoms act as the
donors. The solubilities of all metal chelates were found to be pH dependent.
Complexes of cadmium and lead are insoluble in the pH range 1.0 to 7.1, but are
solubilized when the noncoordinated sulfhydryl and carboxylic acid groups are
ionized. The mercury complex is insoluble in the pH range 1.0 to 3.0. It
dissolves when one of the noncoordinated carboxylic acid groups is ionized. The
dimethyl ester of meso-DMSA (DiMe-meso-DMSA) was synthesized and its acid
dissociation constants were determined (pK1 = 6.38 and pK2 = 8.00).
Esterification of the carboxyl groups of meso-DMSA changes its coordination
properties in that the two sulfur atoms of DiMe-meso-DMSA are used to coordinate 
with Hg2+, Cd2+, or Pb2+. Esterification of meso-DMSA also changes its biological
properties. DiMe-meso-DMSA, when given to rats 3 days after Cd administration,
greatly increased the excretion of Cd via bile. In contrast, meso-DMSA was devoid
of such activity.

Twelve Yucatan micropigs (3 controls; 3 sham-operated; 6 with unilateral
obstruction) were studied to assess the value of noncontrast and
contrast-enhanced (Gadolinium-DTPA) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the
evaluation of partial ureteral obstruction. MR findings were correlated with
findings of quantitative (Tc-99m-DMSA) scintigraphy, and histology. On
noncontrast T1-weighted images, the normal porcine kidney demonstrated good
corticomedullary contrast (CMC = 16.8% +/- 5.0). Five minutes after
administration of Gd-DTPA, there was enhancement of the renal cortex (+24.4% and 
medulla (+46.2%), and CMC was no longer discernible. Enhancement of the urine
within the collecting system (+119.1%) was also observed. The obstructed kidneys 
demonstrated marked thinning of the renal parenchyma and decreased signal
intensity on noncontrast T1- and T2-weighted images (P less than 0.01). Urine in 
the dilated collecting system did not differ significantly from urine in controls
except in the three animals with urinary tract infection (P less than 0.05). Five
minutes following injection of Gd-DTPA, there was enhancement of the renal
parenchyma in all kidneys. Excretion was seen in three pigs and no excretion in
two. Thus, useful information can be obtained in partial ureteral obstruction
from both pre-contrast and Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR images of the kidney.

Renal handling of technetium-99m DMSA: evidence for glomerular filtration and
peritubular uptake.

der Hem GK.

Author information:

Netherlands.

The finding of an enhanced excretion of [99mTc]dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in 
patients with tubular reabsorption disorders prompted us to investigate the role 
of filtration in the renal handling of [99mTc]DMSA. Our studies in human serum
indicated that binding to serum proteins was approximately 90%. Chromatography of
human urine and studies in rats showed that the complex was excreted unaltered
into the urine. Renal extraction of [99mTc]DMSA in a human volunteer was 5.8%.
Continuous infusion of [99mTc]DMSA in 13 individuals with normal renal function
gave the following results (mean +/- s.d.): plasma clearance of [99mTc]DMSA 34
+/- 4 ml/min, urinary clearance of [99mTc]DMSA 12 +/- 3 ml/min. The calculated
filtered load of [99mTc]DMSA closely resembled the urinary clearance, whereas the
plasma clearance was about three times faster. This indicates that peritubular
uptake accounts for approximately 65% and filtration for approximately 35% of the
renal handling of [99mTc]DMSA.

Oxygen, nitrate, and molybdenum regulation of dmsABC gene expression in
Escherichia coli.

Cotter PA(1), Gunsalus RP.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Microbiology, University of California, Los Angeles.

Escherichia coli can respire anaerobically using either trimethylamine-N-oxide
(TMAO) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the terminal electron acceptor for
oxidative phosphorylation. To determine whether the regulation of the dmsABC
genes, which encode a membrane-associated TMAO/DMSO reductase, are
transcriptionally controlled in response to the availability of alternate
electron acceptors, we constructed an operon fusion between the dmsA gene, along 
with its associated regulatory region, and lacZ+. Expression of dmsA'-lacZ was
stimulated 65-fold by anaerobiosis versus aerobiosis, while nitrate caused a
12-fold repression. Its expression, however, was unaffected by the presence of
the alternate electron acceptors DMSO, TMAO, and fumarate. Anaerobic induction of
dmsA'-lacZ was defective in an fnr mutant, thus establishing that Fnr is
responsible for anaerobic activation of dmsABC. Repression of dmsA'-lacZ
expression by nitrate was independent of oxygen and was shown to be mediated by
the products of two genes, narL (frdR2) and narX. dmsA'-lacZ expression was also 
altered in chlD strains that are defective in molybdenum transport but not in
chlA and chlE strains that are defective in molybdopterin cofactor biosynthesis, 
thus establishing that the molybdenum ion but not the ability to form a
functional cofactor is required for regulation. Molybdenum was required both for 
complete induction of dmsA'-lacZ expression during anaerobic growth and for
complete repression of dmsA'-lacZ by nitrate. Additionally, expression of dmsABC 
varied depending on the carbon source. Expression was highest when cells were
grown on sorbitol.

cyclohexane-diaminetetraacetic acid (CDTA) and diethylentria-minepentaacetic acid
(DTPA) on the distribution and excretion of intraperitoneally injected strontium 
were investigated in male Swiss mice. Strontium nitrate was given at a dose equal
to 3.78 mmol/kg and ten minutes after, chelators were administered
intraperitoneally at doses approximately equal to one-fourth of their respective 
LD50 values. DTPA, followed by CDTA, EDTA and tartaric acid, was consistently the
most effective in increasing the urinary excretion of strontium. Only ascorbic
acid increased significantly the fecal excretion of strontium. CDTA, DTPA and
ascorbic acid were also the most effective chelators in reducing the
concentration of strontium found in various tissues. CDTA, DTPA and tartaric acid
are the most effective agents of those tested in the removal of strontium after a
single administration.

[Evaluation of renal scarring in children with primary VUR by 99mTc-DMSA
renoscintigraphy].

[Article in Japanese]

Konda R, Orikasa S, Sakai K, Ota S, Kuji S, Ioritani N, Nakamichi G.

Renal scarring in 271 kidneys of 172 children with primary vesicoureteral reflux 
(VUR) was evaluated by 99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy. 58% of refluxing kidneys were
with renal scar by the initial DMSA renoscintigraphy. Only 52% of these kidneys
showed good correlation between the findings on IVP and DMSA renoscintigram. Of
the 144 refluxing kidneys with normal IVP, 41% had renal scarring on DMSA
renoscintigram. DMSA renoscintigram revealed widespread renal scarring in 28% of 
kidneys with only calyceal clubbing and in 60% of those with segmental cortical
thinning on IVP. It is realized that IVP was an in-sensitive method to evaluate
renal scarring of refluxing kidneys and such kidneys with segmental renal scar on
IVP accompanies more widespread scar on DMSA renoscintigram. These cases were
allocated to 2 age groups, younger than 3 years and older than 4 years. In the
former group less than 10% of kidneys with low grade VUR and about 40% with high 
grade UVR had widespread renal scarring. On the contrary, in the latter group
severe renal scar was recognized in more than 20% of kidneys with low grade VUR
and in about 60% with high grade UVR.

The biodistribution of two stereoisomeric 99Tcm complexes derived from
diastereomeric dimercaptosuccinic acids (DMSA), 99Tcm-dl-DMSA and
99Tcm-meso-DMSA, was examined in sarcoma 180 tumour-bearing mice. The
biodistribution pattern of meso-complex was not significantly different from
99Tc(V)m-DMSA, a new tumour imaging agent, while the dl-complex did not show the 
osteotropic property observed in meso- and 99Tc(V)m-DMSA complexes. The ratio of 
tumour to blood was superior for the 99Tcm-dl-DMSA (2.68) over the
99Tcm-meso-DMSA (1.25) at 3 h, and the ratio was reversed at 6 h, 3.13 to 4.28.
The results indicate that dl-complex is of importance for the possible use in
tumour imaging.

Intramuscular administration of iron during long-term chelation therapy with
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in a man with severe lead poisoning.

Haust HL(1), Inwood M, Spence JD, Poon HC, Peter F.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Western Ontario, Canada.

2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) an investigational chelant structurally
similar to dimercaptopropanol (BAL), offers the advantage of not depleting iron
stores on which basis it would not seem to form a toxic chelate with iron. We
report the case of a man with a formidable body burden of lead (Pb) and depleted 
iron stores who was given iron intramuscularly during a defined period of
long-term retreatment with DMSA. Initiation of retreatment with DMSA, 30
mg/kg/day given orally in three divided doses for the first 7 days markedly
enhanced Pb diuresis, entailed a pronounced fall in blood Pb and abolished
symptoms of Pb poisoning. Continuation of retreatment with two-thirds the initial
DMSA dose for an added 15 days maintained blood Pb at sustained low levels. Iron 
sorbitol administered intramuscularly during this period in individual doses of
100 mg of elemental iron given 3 days apart to a conservative total of 400 mg
produced no untoward effects, suggesting that a toxic chelate between iron and
DMSA was not formed. Serum ferritin entered the normal range and there was
virtually an immediate significant decrease in erythrocyte protoporphyrin.
Together with discernible increases in haemoglobin, haematocrit and MCV, this
pointed to enhanced iron utilization. Since iron utilization is curtailed by high
concentrations of Pb, the immediacy and magnitude of the post-chelation rebound
in blood Pb precluded iron administration at any other stage. From these data,
DMSA emerges as a uniquely versatile new chelant. Suitable for long-term
administration, it permits the simultaneous parenteral administration of iron
during dose-related sustained decreases in blood Pb.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, College of Medicine, University 
of Arizona, Tucson 85721.

The urinary excretion of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), which is an
effective chelating agent for lead, was determined after the oral administration 
of 10 mg DMSA/kg to six normal young men. The DMSA that was absorbed was
extensively biotransformed. After 14 hours only 2.53% of the administered DMSA
was excreted in the urine as unaltered DMSA and 18.1% as altered forms. The
unaltered DMSA was 12% of the total DMSA found in the urine. The altered form(s) 
of DMSA was 88% of the total urinary DMSA. The altered DMSA can be converted to
unaltered DMSA by electrolytic reduction, which indicates that the altered forms 
of DMSA are disulfides. The excretion of altered DMSA reached a peak between 2
and 4 hours after DMSA administration. There were small but statistically
significant increases in the excretion of zinc, copper, and lead after DMSA
administration. DMSA did not influence the urinary excretion of 27 other metals
and elements.

Iodine-123 hippurate renography, [99mTc]diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)
renography, and [99mTc]dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy were
performed before and during angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in a
group of 15 hypertensive patients with angiographically "significant" unilateral 
renal artery stenosis. Visual and quantitative evaluation of the three
radioisotope methods before ACE inhibition already disclosed abnormalities
suggestive of renal artery stenosis in a high percentage (87%, 60%, and 60%,
respectively) in this group of patients, but ACE inhibition further improved the 
diagnostic yield in all three methods (93%, 86%, and 80%). Iodine-123 hippurate
renography was at least as useful as [99mTc]DTPA renography in this respect,
while [99mTc]DMSA scintigraphy can be used particularly in segmental stenosis.
Despite a large drop in blood pressure after ACE inhibition little adverse
reactions were seen and overall renal function was fairly well maintained, the
exceptions noted in patients with initially a more impaired renal function.

the medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Thirty two patients were examined with
131I- or 123I-MIBG and 26 of these were re-examined with 99Tcm(V)-DMSA (planar
and SPECT). From our experience we can draw the following conclusions: (1) the
scintigraphic attempt was useless in patients with normal levels of plasma
calcitonin (CT): (2) in patients with high plasma CT levels, the sensitivity of
the MIBG was better in familiar (3/3 true positive) than in sporadic disease
(7/21 true positive; overall sensitivity = 42%); the 99Tcm(V)-DMSA was positive
in 16/19 cases, (overall sensitivity = 84%) even in cases which had been false
negative with MIBG (6 patients); (3) no false positive results were found; (4)
the scan with 99Tcm(V)-DMSA is then suggested as the first imaging approach
during the follow up in patients affected by MTC and still having high levels of 
plasma CT. The MIBG scan should be limited to the patients in whom the possible
use of MIBG therapy has to be investigated.

Effect of unilateral vesicoureteric reflux on renal growth and the uptake of
99mTc DMSA by the kidney. An experimental study in the minipig.

Godley ML(1), Risdon RA, Ransley PG.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Child Health, London.

The influence of unilateral vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) on renal growth and the
uptake of 99mTc DMSA by the kidney has been investigated in a 2-kidney model in
the growing minipig over a period of approximately 5 months. Animals with reflux 
in association with low voiding pressures and normal bladder function (n = 5), as
well as those with raised voiding pressures and abnormal bladder function (n =
7), were investigated with appropriate non-refluxing controls (n = 12). Urinary
infection and renal scarring were avoided since these factors may affect kidney
function and growth independently. Statistical tests of difference failed to
demonstrate any effect of VUR on renal growth or renal uptake of 99mTc DMSA even 
in the presence of elevated voiding pressures and abnormal detrusor function.

Renal parenchymal scars in adults. Split function and extent of scars at
urography and DMSA scintigraphy.

Thomsen HS(1), Nielsen SL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine Herlev Hospital, Denmark.

In 13 adult patients the occurrence of renal scars was evaluated, and the split
function was determined at both intravenous urography and 99mTc DMSA
scintigraphy. The split function was also measured by the gold standard -
hippuran renography. DMSA scintigraphy turned out to be as good as intravenous
urography for evaluation of established scars and better for determination of
split function. Thus, scintigraphy may replace intravenous urography in adults
with symptoms or signs of renal scars.

Determination and metabolism of dithiol chelating agents. IV. Urinary excretion
of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and mercaptosuccinic acid in rabbits given
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid.

The water-soluble dithiol chelating agents meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) and 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid (DMPS) are becoming of
increasing importance for the treatment of lead, arsenic and mercury poisoning.
There is, however, a paucity of data about their metabolic transformation. Male
rabbits were given DMSA (0.20 mmol/kg) i.m., and urine was collected over a 6-hr 
period. Monobromobimane derivatization, HPLC separation, and fluorescence
detection, along with [U-14C]DMSA data, demonstrated that the total 14C found in 
the urine was distributed as 73% unaltered DMSA, 7% mercaptosuccinic acid and 6
and 14% of two unknowns. Electrolytic reductive treatment of the urine did not
increase the urinary content of DMSA, indicating that oxidative biotransformation
is not a major pathway for DMSA in the rabbit. This latter result is strikingly
different from that for DMPS in rabbit.

Influence of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid on gastrointestinal lead absorption and

(1)Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and
Surgeons, New York, New York 10032.

2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a new orally active heavy metal chelator
for the treatment of childhood Pb intoxication on an outpatient basis. The
influence of DMSA, as well as other chelating agents, on gastrointestinal 203Pb
absorption and whole-body 203Pb retention was examined. Groups of Sprague-Dawley 
rats (230-260 g) were gavaged with a solution containing approximately 25 mg/kg
Pb [as Pb(NO3)2] plus 15 microCi 203Pb. Some groups were then immediately given
0.11 mmol/kg of either DMSA, CaNa2EDTA, D-penicillamine, or BAL by oral gavage,
while other groups received the same drugs by ip injection. Control groups
received solutions of the drug vehicles po or ip. Whole-body Pb retention and
gastrointestinal Pb absorption (whole body retention + urinary Pb excretion) were
significantly decreased in rats that received DMSA po. This finding implies that 
the use of DMSA to treat childhood lead intoxication on an outpatient basis is
not associated with a risk for increased Pb absorption.

Influence of 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate and dimercaptosuccinic acid on the
mobilization of mercury from tissues of rats pretreated with mercuric chloride,
phenylmercury acetate or mercury vapors.

Buchet JP(1), Lauwerys RR.

Author information: 
(1)Industrial Toxicology Unit, Catholic University of Louvain, Bruxelles,
Belgium.

The efficiency of the sodium salt of 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS)
and meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) to mobilize mercury from tissues has been
assessed in rats pretreated with different doses of HgCl2, phenylmercury acetate 
or exposed to different concentrations of mercury vapors. These pretreatments
increase the mercury concentration in the kidney and to a lower extent in the
liver. Only exposure to metallic mercury vapor leads to mercury accumulation in
the brain. Both chelators mobilize mercury stored in the kidney and the amount of
metal excreted in urine following a single administration of DMSA is a good
indicator of the renal burden of mercury. The rate of removal is greater after
DMPS administration than after DMSA but repeated administration of either agents 
eventually leads to the same total amount of mercury mobilized from the kidney.
The loss of mercury from the liver can be slightly accelerated by repeated
administration of the chelators. However, the chelators are inefficient in
removing mercury from the brain.

The effect of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), glutathione (GSH), citrate
and 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on the elimination of cadmium (Cd) from
human blood, by complexing haemodialysis, was investigated in vitro. A
significant increase in elimination rate was observed with all four chelators
compared to that observed without chelators. EDTA was found to be the most
effective agent, which at a level of 0.01M in the dialysate facilitated
elimination of 80% of the blood Cd originally present.

Quantitation of renal uptake of technetium-99m DMSA using SPECT.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Nuclear Medicine, Rebecca Sieff Government Hospital, Safed,
Israel.

Quantitative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) methodology based
on calibration with kidney phantoms has been applied for the assessment of renal 
uptake of [99mTc]DMSA in 25 normals; 16 patients with a single normal kidney; 30 
patients with unilateral nephropathy; and 17 patients with bilateral nephropathy.
An excellent correlation (r = 0.99, s.e.e. = 152) was found between SPECT
measured concentration and actual concentration in kidney phantoms. Kidney uptake
at 6 hr after injection in normals was 20.0% +/- 4.6% for the left and 20.8% +/- 
4.4% for the right. Patients with unilateral nephropathy had a statistically
significant (p less than 0.001) low uptake in the diseased kidney (7.0% +/-
4.7%), but the contralateral kidney uptake did not differ from the normal group
(20.0% +/- 7.0%). The method was especially useful in patients with bilateral
nephropathy. Significantly (p less than 0.001) decreased uptake was found in both
kidneys (5.1% +/- 3.4% for the left and 6.7% +/- 4.2% for the right). The total
kidney uptake (right and left) in this group showed to be inversely correlated (r
= 0.83) with serum creatinine. The uptake of [99mTc]DMSA in single normal kidney 
was higher (p less than 0.001) than in a normal kidney (34.7% +/- 11.9%),
however, it was lower than the total absolute uptake (RT + LT = 41.5% +/- 8.8%)
in the normal group. The results indicate that SPECT is a reliable and
reproducible technique to quantitate absolute kidney uptake of [99mTc]DMSA.

Technetium-99m (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid uptake in patients with head and neck 
squamous carcinoma: experience in imaging.

Watkinson JC(1), Lazarus CR, Mistry R, Shaheen OH, Maisey MN, Clarke SE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Guy's Hospital, London, UK.

A recently developed imaging agent, technetium-99m (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc (v) DMSA), has been used to assess head and neck squamous carcinoma (SCC).
We have prospectively studied 62 patients of whom 53 had a histologically proven 
head and neck SCC. The remaining nine had benign lesions. The results of planar
imaging in patients with primary disease yielded an 85% sensitivity and 78%
specificity. Planar imaging in patients with cervical lymphadenopathy revealed a 
59% sensitivity. Nineteen patients also had single photon emission computed
tomography imaging which improved the image quality, spatial resolution and
sensitivity of the investigation. Twenty-seven patients were scanned before and
after radiotherapy and, of these, 96% showed positive uptake in the salivary
glands with no evidence of tumor recurrence. This study has shown 99mTc (v) DMSA 
imaging provides a cheap and rapid method of investigating head and neck SCC and 
further studies are necessary to evaluate its role in the management of patients 
with this disease.

Lack of effectiveness of D-penicillamine in experimental arsenic poisoning.

Kreppel H(1), Reichl FX, Forth W, Fichtl B.

Author information: 
(1)Walther-Straub-Institute for Pharmacology and Toxicology, Munchen, FRG, West
Germany.

Based on some anecdotal case reports D-penicillamine (DPA) has been advocated for
the treatment of arsenic poisoning. Experimental evidence, however, supporting
that recommendation is lacking. In the present experiments the effectiveness of
DPA was compared with dimercaprol (British Antilewisite, BAL),
dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) using
different controlled experimental settings. In one study mice received As2O3
(9-14 mg/kg sc). Treatment with DMSA after 30 min afforded almost complete
protection against the lethal effects of arsenic whereas DPA was not effective.
In a second study, mice and guinea pigs were injected sc with 8.4 mg/kg As2O3
(containing a tracer dose of 74As). Thirty min later 0.7 mmol/kg of DPA or one of
the other antidotes was injected ip. As determined 4 and 12 h after the arsenic
injection, DPA was unable to reduce the 74As content in any of the organs
investigated (blood, liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, testes, spleen,
skeletal muscle, and skin). On the other hand, BAL, DMPS, and DMSA markedly
reduced the tissue content of 74As with respect to controls. Finally, the ability
of the antidotes to reverse biochemical effects of arsenic was investigated in
vitro using suspensions of incubated renal tubulus cells. The marked inhibition
of gluconeogenesis induced by 30 mumol/L As2O3 was almost completely reversed
upon addition of 90 mumol of either BAL, DMPS, or DMSA. In this experimental
model, too, DPA was ineffective. It was concluded that the use of DPA in arsenic 
poisoning needs to be reevaluated.

Determination and metabolism of dithiol chelating agents. VI. Isolation and
identification of the mixed disulfides of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid with
L-cysteine in human urine.

Maiorino RM(1), Bruce DC, Aposhian HV.

Virtually nothing is known about the biotransformation of the heavy metal
chelating agent, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). Two fasted, normal,
young men were given 10.0 mg DMSA/kg po, and their urines were collected over a
14-hr period. Urine samples were analyzed, before and after electrolytic
reductive treatment, for DMSA and its biotransformants using bromobimane
derivatization, HPLC separation, and fluorescence detection. Metabolites were
isolated by HPLC, ion-pairing extraction, ion-exchange extraction, and TLC. By 14
hr after DMSA administration, 87% of the total DMSA and 95% of the total
L-cysteine found in urine consisted of altered forms of these compounds. The
urinary excretion of altered DMSA, at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 14 hr after
administration of DMSA, when compared to the urinary excretion of altered
L-cysteine had a correlation coefficient of 0.952 and p less than 0.003.
Approximately 90% of the altered DMSA excreted in the 2- to 4-hr urine was found 
in disulfide linkage with L-cysteine. The remaining 10% was found as cyclic
disulfides of DMSA. Of the mixed disulfides found in 4- to 6-hr urine, 97%
consisted of two L-cysteine residues per one DMSA and the remaining 3% consisted 
of one L-cysteine per one DMSA. The 2:1 mixed disulfides (97%) were isolated as
three distinct species by TLC, consisting of 77, 12, and 8% of the total mixed
disulfides found. In addition to the novelty of these biotransformants of DMSA,
the DMSA-cysteine mixed disulfides indicate a thiol-disulfide interchange between
DMSA and L-cystine. The discovery of the formation of these water soluble
DMSA-cysteine mixed disulfides should encourage the evaluation of DMSA in the
treatment of cystinuria.

The value of rapid, contrast-enhanced, diuretic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
(using ferrioxamine B and furosemide) in demonstrating partial unilateral
ureteral obstruction and the potential of such MR imaging in differentiating
obstructive from nonobstructive hydronephrosis was assessed in six micropigs. MR 
imaging (0.35 Tesla, partial-flip technique with repetition time [TR] of 125
milliseconds, echo-delay time [TE] of 20 milliseconds, and flip angle of 70
degrees) was performed before, and at 5, 12, and 19 days after partial ureteral
obstruction. Additionally, MR images were acquired 5, 12, and 19 days after
release of obstruction. The diuretic was injected 10 minutes after the contrast
medium. MR findings were correlated with results from nuclear scintigraphy
(99mTc-DMSA uptake). MR images provided good morphologic detail from which renal 
size, parenchymal thickness, and degree of hydronephrosis could be determined.
Contrast medium allowed assessment of cortical uptake and urinary excretion. The 
course of cortical signal enhancement best characterized the difference between
obstructive and nonobstructive hydronephrosis. Normal kidneys and kidneys with
nonobstructive hydronephrosis showed progressive decrease in cortical signal
enhancement (-11.7% within 40 minutes) after furosemide injection. The kidneys
with obstructive hydronephrosis demonstrated a plateau of signal enhancement
without decrease (-0.7% within 40 minutes). These results demonstrate the utility
of rapid contrast-enhancing, diuretic MR imaging in differentiating obstructive
from nonobstructive hydronephrosis.

[Early surgery of obstructive uropathies discovered antenatally. First results
apropos of 56 cases].

[Article in French]

Averous M(1), Guiter J, Grasset D.

Author information: 
(1)Clinique Urologique, Hôpital Lapeyronie, CHU, Montpellier.

Between September 1984 and April 1988, 56 children underwent surgery for an
obstructive uropathy discovered on antenatal ultrasound examination. These
included 31 cases of stenosis of the pyelo-ureteral junction (PUJ), 9 cases of
vesicorenal reflux, 6 mega-ureters (MU), 6 ureteroceles, 3 posterior urethral
valves and 1 ectopic ureteral orifice. Major reflux (type III and IV) was
included within the obstructive uropathy classification in that it opposes the
normal pressure gradient which ensures progression of urine towards the bladder. 
The nature of the obstruction, morphological study of the kidneys and the renal
function itself were very precisely studied and monitored (IVU, ultrasound,
isotope tests, DTPA with frusemide and DMSA). In 46 children reconstructive and
conservative surgery was possible. Analysis of the various groups of uropathy
showed that: 1. Stenosis of the JPU had a very favorable or sometimes spectacular
outcome both functionally and morphologically. 2. Cases of reflux showed
excellent results, except in the presence of preexisting major renal dysplasia.
3. Mega-ureters had a less good prognosis. Renal growth depended above all on the
degree of renal dysplasia which was often associated. 4. This was also true for
sever forms of posterior urethral valves. A discussion follows which tries to
reply to the following questions: 1. Why does early surgery for stenosis of the
JPU give better results? 2. On the other hand, why is the same benefit not
obtained in the other obstructive uropathies?

A review of the secretion of radioactivity in human breast milk: data,
quantitative analysis and recommendations.

Mountford PJ(1), Coakley AJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Kent and Canterbury Hospital, UK.

A general method is given to quantify the radioactivity ingested by a breast-fed 
infant following maternal radiopharmaceutical administration, and to derive the
period to interrupt feeding which reduces the corresponding effective dose
equivalent to below 1 mSv. Results are presented from applying the method to all 
available measurements of radioactivity secreted in breast milk. This review
includes some hitherto unpublished data, takes more account of the scarcity of
the available data, and has resulted in modifications to the guidance for
interrupting breast feeding. Recommendations for interrupting feeding with mature
milk have been expanded into four categories: (1) interruption not essential; (2)
interruption for a fixed period of time; (3) interruption until measurements
indicate feeding can be resumed; and (4) cease breast feeding. Changes to the
earlier guidance are that 99Tcm-pertechnetate, (99Tcm) erythrocytes, 125I-OIH and
131I-OIH have been moved to the third category, and that recommendations have
been included for 99Tcm-DMSA, 99Tcm-glucoheptonate, 99Tcm-HDP, 99Tcm-HMDP,
123I-iodide and 123I-OIH. Before recommendations (1) and (2) can be issued to a
mother, quality control measurements must be made of the radiopharmaceutical
administered. Recommendations (3) or (4) only should be issued to mothers
secreting colostrum. If there are changes in the recommended dosimetry in the
future, the calculated fractional ingested activities can be used as a basis to
refine the recommendations.

Diagnostic and therapeutic potential of new radiopharmaceutical agents in
medullary thyroid carcinoma.

Troncone L, Rufini V, De Rosa G, Testa A.

Recently developed radiopharmaceuticals have been proposed for imaging medullary 
thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with some having therapeutic potential. This study
compares the imaging results obtained with radioiodinated
meta-iodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG), 99mTc (V) DMSA, and 131I F(ab')2
anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA) in a group of MTC patients. In 23
patients 131I MIBG imaging showed a high specificity (no false-positive results) 
but a less satisfactory sensitivity (50%). In 12 patients 99mTc (V) DMSA revealed
a better sensitivity (77%) but a lower specificity (three false-positive
results). Positive results were obtained in two of three patients studied with
131I F(ab')2 anti-CEA. These data suggest that the highly sensitive 99mTc (V)
DMSA should be considered as a first choice procedure followed by the highly
specific radioiodinated MIBG to confirm the initial results. Since radioiodinated
MIBG imaging may have therapeutic usefulness, 131I MIBG was evaluated in an
integrated treatment protocol in four cases of proven MTC. The preliminary
results obtained were encouraging.

The role of radiopharmaceuticals MIBG and (V) DMSA in the diagnosis of medullary 
thyroid carcinoma.

Verga U, Muratori F, Di Sacco G, Banfi F, Libroia A.

The diagnostic value of 123/131I meta-iodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG) and 99mTc (V)
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was investigated in 12 patients with proven
medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Scintigraphic imaging with DMSA was negative
in nine of 12 patients. Scintigraphy with MIBG was positive in only one case. In 
proven primary or recurrent disease, DMSA sensitivity was 50% and MIBG
sensitivity was 25%. Such sensitivities become much lower in subjects with high
calcitonin (CT) levels who have had negative surgical explorations: DMSA 17% and 
MIBG 0%. DMSA detected tumor in 25% of the patients and MIBG in only 8%. The
positivity of these scintigraphies appears to be unrelated to carcinoembryonic
antigen and CT plasma levels. Such data suggest that scintigraphies with MIBG and
DMSA are only modestly useful in the diagnosis of MTC.

Experience in imaging medullary thyroid carcinoma using 99mTc (V)
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).

Clarke S, Lazarus C, Maisey M.

99mTc (V) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a new tumor imaging agent that has
been successfully used to image patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). 
Since 1986, studies have been performed in 32 patients with histologically proven
MTC at Guy's Hospital, London, England. Five patients with primary tumor were
studied prior to surgery, four patients were studied after successful removal of 
the primary tumor, and 26 patients with biochemical evidence of recurrence were
studied. Eight patients were studied serially to assess progression of disease,
and four patients were studied before and after surgery. Twenty-one of the 26
patients with disease had positive scans with four false-negative scans and three
true negative scans. One patient had a false-positive scan (sensitivity 80%,
specificity 75%). Two of the false-negative scans were obtained in patients with 
moderate but stable elevations of calcitonin but no other evidence of recurrence.
One false-negative scan was obtained in a patient who was discovered on screening
to have an abnormal pentagastrin response, and a small 1 cm tumor was
subsequently removed. Uptake in local neck recurrence was frequently intense, but
uptake at sites of bone metastases was less marked. 99mTc (V) DMSA is an
inexpensive radiopharmaceutical which produces good quality images and has been
shown to have an acceptable sensitivity and specificity in the follow-up of
patients with MTC and thereby contributes significantly to the management of
these patients.

Comment in
    Pediatr Nephrol. 1989 Jan;3(1):6-8.

Following the diagnosis of primary vesicoureteric reflux, identified as part of
the investigation of urinary tract infection, 299 refluxing kidneys in 202
children (aged 0-14 years) were prospectively evaluated using intravenous
urography (IVU) and the DMSA renal scan at least 4 weeks after urine infection.
There was 88% concordance between IVU and the DMSA scan, but in 12% there were
discrepancies manifested in 37 kidneys from 31 children. Thirty-four kidneys were
normal on IVU but showed scars of reflux nephropathy (RN) on the technetium
99m--dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan; 4 of these (2 infants and 2
pre-school children) had severe generalized changes on scanning. Three kidneys
were normal of DMSA scan and, although abnormal on initial IVU, were considered
to be normal when this was repeated. During a follow-up period of 5 years an
annual DMSA was undertaken in 194 patients and the renal scars remained unchanged
in all except 1 child. The IVU was repeated 1-3 years after the initial study in 
31 children in which the results of the first imaging did not agree. In 28
patients (34 kidneys) in which the initial IVU was normal but the DMSA abnormal, 
IVU evidence of scarring emerged in 30 of 34 kidneys, including the 4 patients
with severe generalized damage on the DMSA. We conclude that abnormalities
detected by the DMSA scan may precede the radiological findings, especially in
young children. Even severe RN can be established in kidneys that appear normal
on the IVU.

Tc-99m-(V)-DMSA: the new sensitive and specific radiopharmaceutical for imaging
metastases of medullary thyroid carcinomas?

Becker W(1), Börner W, Reiners C.

Author information: 
(1)Klinik und Poliklinik für Nuklearmedizin, Universität Würzburg, Germany.

In the follow-up of five patients with histologic proven medullary thyroid
carcinoma (MTC) and raised serum calcitonin and CEA levels the pentavalent
Tc-99m-(V)-DMSA and the Tc-99m-MDP bone scan had the highest sensitivity in the
localisation of metastases. Both methods are not tumor specific. A false positive
Tc-99m-(V)-DMSA uptake in an old osteomyelitis of one vertebra could be
demonstrated. The J-123-MIBG and In-111-F(ab2)' antibody scan did not allow to
localise one of the above described metastases. In conclusion in the follow-up of
patients with MTC and elevated tumor marker concentrations the Tc-99m-(V)-DMSA
and the Tc-99m-MDP bone scan should be the second diagnostic procedures after
sonography has been performed.

Physico-chemical study of the radiopharmaceuticals 99mTc-DMSA, 99mTc-EDTA and
99mTc-DTPA interaction with plasmatic proteins.

Spain.

This report studies the binding rate of the radiopharmaceuticals 99mTc-DTPA,
99mTc-EDTA and 99mTc-DMSA to plasmatic proteins. The proteins bind to the tested 
radiopharmaceuticals in the following sequence: 99mTc-DTPA less than
99mTc-DMSA(C1) less than 99mTc-EDTA less than 99mTc-DMSA(C2) where C1 and C2
represent two different Tc-DMSA complexes. The thermodynamic study suggests a
quantitative relationship of radiopharmaceutical:protein = 1:1 and an almost
nonexistent influence of the temperature, which means that the interacting forces
in this process are relatively weak.

Mobilization of lead by esters of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Singh PK(1), Jones MM, Xu Z, Gale GR, Smith AB, Atkins LM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37235.

An examination was made of the relative efficacies of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol
(BAL) and three diesters ( [CH(SH)COOR]2; DMDMS, R = CH3; DEDMS, R = C2H5; and
Di-PDMS, R = CH(CH3)2] of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in mobilizing
freshly injected lead from mice. These diesters, like BAL, reduced the lead
levels resulting from freshly injected lead in both the soft tissues (liver,
kidneys, spleen, and brain) and the bone (tibia). After treatment with the
dimethyl (DMDMS), the diethyl (DEDMS), and the diisopropyl (Di-PDMS) esters the
lead content of each of the organs was significantly less than that present in
the untreated controls. Each of the diesters reduced lead levels in the kidneys, 
liver, and spleen significantly below those levels found after BAL treatment. The
action of the diesters in reducing brain lead levels was comparable to that of
BAL. Di-PDMS was the most effective of these compounds and was significantly
superior to BAL. Each of the esters was also significantly more effective than
BAL in reducing the whole body level of lead.

Renal parenchymal damage on DMSA-scintigraphy in pelviureteric obstruction.

Kullendorff CM(1), Evander E.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Surgery, University of Lund, Sweden.

During a 1.5 year period 21 children were investigated with 99-m-technetium
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) before operation for hydronephrosis due to
pelviureteric obstruction. The age at investigation was 0.2-11.5 years.
Fourty-two kidneys were examined. Hydronephrosis existed on the right side in 8
cases, left side in 9 and bilateral in 4 cases. Seventeen kidneys had no
obstruction. The scintigraphy was interpreted as normal in 19 kidneys. Decreased 
isotope uptake was found in 23 kidneys and localized to the upper pole area in 19
kidneys, middle-lateral part in 7, lower pole area in 15 and the middle-medial
part in 12 kidneys. There were no predominance for any part of the kidney to be
affected by parenchymal damage. In 8 children investigated before the age of 1
year, 4 of 10 hydronephrotic kidneys revealed normal DMSA scintigram. DMSA
scintigraphy delineates functioning renal parenchyma. DMSA scintigraphy
delineates functioning renal parenchyma. It can be recommended as a routine
method for evaluation of the renal parenchyma before surgery and for follow up
studies in all ages of childhood.

Renal imaging with 99Tcm-labelled DMSA in the detection of acute pyelonephritis: 
an experimental study in the pig.

Parkhouse HF(1), Godley ML, Cooper J, Risdon RA, Ransley PG.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Child Health, London, UK.

Serial renal 99Tcm-labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigrams were
acquired 2-58 days after the introduction of urinary tract infection in 33 pigs
with experimentally induced vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). In 29 animals VUR was
unilateral and in four bilateral, a total of 37 refluxing systems. Animals were
killed either at varying intervals after a scintigraphic defect was noted (24
refluxing kidneys) or after a period when sequential scintigrams were normal (13 
refluxing kidneys). The appearance of the scintigram acquired on the day prior to
death was compared with the renal pathology, each kidney and renal image being
divided into three zones (upper, middle, lower) for separate consideration. Of
the 37 refluxing systems pyelonephritic lesions were seen in 27, in a total of 61
zones. In the remaining ten kidneys no scintigraphic defect was detected and no
pathological lesions were identified either macroscopically or microscopically.
Where an abnormality was detected on the scintigram a lesion was always
identified in the kidney (sensitivity 100%). Small pyelonephritic lesions in a
total of 12 zones in six kidneys were not detected on the scintigram (specificity
82%). Of the lesions undetected by scintigraphy only one occurred in the upper
pole.

[Radiation burden in children in roentgenologic and radionuclide examinations of 
the urinary tract].

[Article in Russian]

Husak V, Svec J, Zezulka L, Lidova LN.

Employing own measurements, calculations and literary data the values of the
effective dose equivalent were determined for one-year-old and five-year-old
children as well as adults undergoing intravenous urography, cystography,
scintigraphy of kidneys and renography. It is stated that the radiation burden of
five-year old children from x-ray examinations is comparable with the radiation
burden due to scintigraphic examinations of kidneys by means of 99mTc-DTPA,
99mTc-gluconate and 99mTc-DMSA. The effective dose equivalent from scintigraphic 
examinations of children aged one year is an order of magnitude higher than that 
from x-ray examinations mentioned. The effective dose equivalent for adults from 
urography exceeds an order of magnitude the value of this quantity from
scintigraphy by means of 99mTc-gluconate or 99mTc-DTPA. The results are presented
in tables and graphs.

Comparative mobilization of lead by chelating agents.

Xu ZF(1), Jones MM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Public Health, China Medical University, Shenyang, People's
Republic of China.

The relative abilities of approximately 20 chelating agents to act as antagonists
for acute and chronic lead poisoning have been examined in the mouse. The acute
LD50 for lead acetate trihydrate was determined and found to be 135.3 mg Pb/kg
for i.p. injection with a 95% confidence interval of 87.1-210.3 mg Pb/kg. The
relative efficacy of chelating agents to reduce liver, kidney, spleen, bone and
brain levels of lead was determined. The movement of lead from the liver to the
bone was followed during the first 7 days post injection and was found to result 
in appreciable changes in the lead levels of these organs from day to day during 
this entire period. Of the compounds examined, the ones which were most effective
in mobilizing lead under various conditions included meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic 
acid (DMSA), sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DPMS), disodium calcium
ethylene-diaminetetraacetate (Na2CaEDTA), trisodium zinc
triethylenetetraminehexa-acetate, dicalcium
ethylenediaminetetra(methylenephosphonate) (Ca2EDTPO) and diethyl
dimercaptosuccinate (DEMSA) and 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (BAL).

A false positive I-131 MIBG due to dilated renal pelvis: a case report.

Bahar RH(1), Mahmoud S, Ibrahim A, al-Gazzar AH.

Author information: 
(1)Nuclear Medicine Department, Mubarak Al-Kabeer Hospital, Kuwait.

A case of false positive I-131 MIBG imaging for detection of pheochromocytoma is 
presented. There was an area of increased tracer uptake in the left renal region 
that showed steadily reducing activity over a period of three days. This raised
the suspicion of a dilated renal pelvis, which was later confirmed by Tc-99m DTPA
imaging. It is advisable in cases of ambiguous I-131 MIBG imaging to use Tc-99m
DTPA rather than Tc-99m DMSA for localizing the kidneys and renal pelvis.

Nucleotide sequence of the dmsABC operon encoding the anaerobic
dimethylsulphoxide reductase of Escherichia coli.

Bilous PT(1), Cole ST, Anderson WF, Weiner JH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

The nucleotide sequence of a 6.5 kilobasepair chromosomal DNA fragment encoding
the anaerobic dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) reductase operon of Escherichia coli has 
been determined. The DMSO reductase structural operon was shown to consist of
three open reading frames, namely dmsABC, encoding polypeptides with predicted
molecular weights of 87,350, 23,070, and 30,789 Daltons, respectively. The DMS A 
polypeptide displayed a high degree of amino acid sequence homology with the
single-subunit enzyme, biotin sulphoxide reductase (bisC) and with formate
dehydrogenase (fdhF), suggesting that the active site and molybdopterin cofactor 
binding site that is common to these enzymes is located in the DMS A subunit. A
comparison of the predicted N-terminal amino acids of the dmsA gene product to
those of the 82,600 subunit of purified DMSO reductase indicated that
post-translational processing of a 16 amino acid peptide at the amino terminus of
DMS A had occurred. The DMS B polypeptide contains 16 cysteine residues organized
in four clusters, two of which are typical of 4Fe-4S binding domains. The DMS C
polypeptide is composed of eight segments of hydrophobic amino acids of
appropriate length to cross the cytoplasmic membrane, suggesting that this
subunit functions to anchor the enzyme to the membrane.

Mobilization of cadmium in mice by combined treatment with
N-benzyl-N-dithiocarboxy-D-glucamine and diesters of meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid.

Gale GR(1), Atkins LM, Smith AB, Singh PK, Jones MM.

Author information: 
(1)Veterans Administration Medical Center, Charleston, SC 29403.

Mice which had received a non-lethal injection of cadmium (Cd) as CdCl2 nine days
prior to therapy were treated with N-benzyl-N-dithiocarboxy-D-glucamine (BDCG)
alone or in combination with either di(iso-butyl)dimercaptosuccinate (DiBDMS) or 
di(iso-amyl)-dimercaptosuccinate (DiADMS). Seven injections of BDCG (1.0
mmole/kg), DiBDMS (0.4 mmole/kg), and DiADMS (0.4 mmol/kg) reduced whole body Cd 
burdens 50%, 54% and 37%, respectively; coadministration of BDCG + DiBDMS and
BDCG + DiADMS produced respective reductions of 65% and 61%. Seven injections of 
BDCG lowered renal Cd concentrations an average of 82%, but reduced hepatic Cd
concentrations only 53%. The DMSA diesters were more effective in lowering
hepatic Cd than in reducing the levels of Cd in the kidneys. The respective
hepatic and renal Cd reductions were 50% and 20% after treatment with DiADMS, and
were 73% and 30% after treatment with DiBDMS. Coadministration of BDCG with
DiADMS reduced hepatic and renal Cd concentrations 74% and 82%, respectively,
while BDCG co-administered with DiBDMS yielded respective reductions of 80% and
82%. It is suggested that combined use of these newer Cd complexing agents in
studies of experimental Cd poisoning may now permit resolution of the issue of
reversibility of Cd-induced nephrotoxicity.

Oral cadmium chloride intoxication in mice: effects of penicillamine,
dimercaptosuccinic acid and related compounds.

Andersen O(1), Nielsen JB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Environmental Medicine, Odense University, Denmark.

The antidotal efficacies of chelators during acute cadmium intoxication has
previously been examined in experiments where both a soluble cadmium salt and the
chelator were administered parenterally. In the present study, PA, DMSA and
related compounds were studied as oral antidotes during oral CdCl2 intoxication. 
According to the antagonistic effects noted on mortality, peristaltic toxicity
and intestinal cadmium uptake, the relative efficacies of the compounds tested
were: DMSA greater than PAD greater than DMPS greater than MSA greater than PA
greater than NAPA. None of the chelators induced major changes in the organ
distribution of absorbed cadmium, in particular no increased cerebral deposition 
of cadmium. This study indicates that, in oral cadmium intoxication in humans,
orally administered DMSA would be likely to offer protection against the local
toxicity of cadmium in the gastrointestinal tract as well as to reduce the risk
of systemic toxicity of absorbed cadmium.

Developmental toxicity of subcutaneously administered meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid in mice.

Domingo JL(1), Paternain JL, Llobet JM, Corbella J.

Barcelona, Reus, Spain.

meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a water-soluble effective antidote for
the treatment of heavy-metal intoxications. Information concerning the
developmental toxicity of DMSA, however, has not been available. In order to
determine the potential developmental toxicity of DMSA, pregnant Swiss mice were 
given 0, 410, 820, or 1640 mg DMSA/kg/day subcutaneously on Days 6-15 of
gestation. Maternal effects included a significant reduction in weight gain
during the exposure and postexposure periods at 1640 mg/kg/day. Food consumption 
was similar to controls at all doses levels except for the high dose group in the
post-treatment period. Results of hematological and serum biochemical analyses in
the DMSA-treated groups were comparable to those of the controls. However, in
light of the pronounced effects on maternal weight gain the dose of 1640
mg/kg/day would be maternally toxic. Significant increases in the number of
resorptions and the incidence of stunting were found, along with a significant
decrease in the number of live fetuses per litter, when the 1640 mg/kg/day group 
was compared with the controls. Significant reductions in fetal body weight and
fetal body length means were also found when the 820 and 1640 mg/kg/day groups
were compared with the controls. Consequently, these results indicate that DMSA
would be embryo-toxic to mice at 1640 mg/kg/day and fetotoxic at 820 mg/kg/day.
In contrast, very slight fetotoxicity was observed at 410 mg/kg/day. Gross
external, internal soft tissue, and skeletal examinations of the fetuses revealed
that DMSA was teratogenic in the mouse when given subcutaneously at 820 and 1640 
mg/kg/day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid treatment of heavy metal poisoning in humans.

Fournier L(1), Thomas G, Garnier R, Buisine A, Houze P, Pradier F, Dally S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Clinical Toxicology, Fernand Widal Hospital, Paris, France.

14 patients with heavy metal poisoning received 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA). 12 subjects were given 30 mg/kg/day for 5 days; 1 subject was started on 
a lower dose because of a history of atopy; another subject was treated for 15
days because of very high initial blood lead concentrations. In the 9 subjects
who had lead poisoning, DMSA decreased blood lead concentrations by 35 to 81%,
and induced a 4.5- to 16.9-fold increase in mean daily urinary excretion of the
metal. In the acutely arsenic-poisoned case, the plasma arsenic concentration on 
day 7 was half the pretreatment value, while no clear decrease was observed in a 
chronically exposed subject. In 3 mercury cases, DMSA increased daily mercury
urinary excretion 1.5-, 2.8- and 8.4-fold, respectively, while blood mercury
concentrations remained below detection limits. No serious side effects were
observed and 3 weeks after administration of the drug the clinical condition of
all subjects was either stable or improved. These results indicate the efficacy
of DMSA for lead poisoning in humans and provide a rationale for further
investigating its usefulness in mercury and arsenic poisoning cases.

99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan as first investigation of urinary tract
infection.

Verber IG(1), Strudley MR, Meller ST.

Author information: 
(1)Queen Mary's Hospital for Children, Carshalton.

A total of 115 children under 5 years who presented with a first symptomatic
urinary tract infection and who had a 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan
were studied to assess its value and compare the findings with those of other
imaging techniques. Renal cortical defects were detected in 65 kidneys by DMSA
scan, intravenous urogram, and ultrasound scan combined; 62 (95%) being seen on
DMSA scan. The finding of reflux on micturating cystourethrography showed a
highly significant correlation with renal defects seen on DMSA scanning, a less
close but still significant correlation with abnormalities on intravenous
urography, but none with ultrasound scan findings. The sensitivity of the DMSA
scan in screening for all grades of reflux is estimated as 0.66, which is higher 
than that previously reported for the intravenous urogram or ultrasound scan.
DMSA scans were less likely to miss grade 3 reflux than the other two methods.
DMSA scans are more useful than other upper renal tract imaging techniques in
detecting renal defects. Consideration should be given to their use as a first
investigation in place of routine intravenous urograms. Ultrasound scans alone
will overlook potentially serious urinary tract abnormalities.

99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan in patients with established
radiological renal scarring.

Smellie JM(1), Shaw PJ, Prescod NP, Bantock HM.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatrics, University College Hospital, London.

The findings on 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans were examined in 54
patients aged 3 to 33 years in whom renal scarring had been diagnosed
radiologically in childhood after urinary tract infection. There was no recent
history of infection. Vesicoureteric reflux had been present in 48 patients and
had stopped in 23 at the time of the DMSA scan. In six of the 72 radiologically
scarred kidneys, the DMSA scan appeared normal but scarring would have been
overlooked in only two of the 54 patients. DMSA scan changes are non-specific and
underestimated individual scars in 21 kidneys. The intravenous urogram and the
DMSA scan showed good correlation but should be regarded as complementary
investigations in these patients, giving morphological and functional
information, respectively. On DMSA scans the timing of any preceding urinary
tract infection must be considered in order to differentiate diffuse potentially 
reversible defects in isotope uptake after urinary tract infection from those due
to permanent renal scarring.

The role of scintigraphy in urinary tract infection.

Conway JJ(1).

Author information: 
(1)Division of Nuclear Medicine, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL.

There is controversy regarding the role of radiological imaging for urinary tract
infection (UTI). The "gold standard" has been the intravenous pyelogram (IVP).
Yet, the IVP has a very limited value with only about 25% of children with
pyelonephritis demonstrating abnormalities. Ultrasound (US) has recently been
advocated as a replacement for the poorly sensitive and poorly specific IVP.
However, comparative studies between US and IVP indicate only an equivalent
sensitivity and specificity. Cortical scintigraphy with Technetium-99m
glucoheptonate (99mTc GH) or 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc DMSA) has also 
been advocated as a means of differentiating parenchymal (pyelonephritis) from
nonparenchymal (lower UTI) involvement in UTI. The clinical presentation may be
misleading especially in the infant and child in whom an elevated temperature,
flank pain, shaking chills, or an elevated sedimentation rate are often lacking. 
The clinician attempts to localize the site of infection for it has a direct
bearing upon the therapy. A collecting system infection can often be eradicated
with a single oral dose of an appropriate antibiotic, whereas renal parenchymal
involvement requires IV therapy for an extended interval. Cortical scintigraphy
can localize the site of infection with a high degree of accuracy. Recent studies
report a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 81% of pyelonephritis. This is in 
contrast to the IVP with a sensitivity of only 24% and US with a sensitivity of
only 42%. The scintigraphic appearance of parenchymal infection of the kidney is 
a spectrum of minimal to gross defects reflecting the degree of histologic
involvement that spans from a mild infection to frank abscess. Cortical
scintigraphy can be used to monitor the evolution of scarring following
infection. Cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc DMSA or 99mTc GH is the method of
choice for the initial evaluation of UTI. Not only does it have a very high
sensitivity and specificity for differentiating parenchymal from collecting
system disease, but it also provides an accurate quantitative measurement of
function and in combination with radioiodinated orthoiodohippurate renography and
Lasix (furosemide; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago) diuresis will also
differentiate significant obstruction from stasis. The use of radionuclide
techniques opens new vistas for the investigation of UTI. Cortical scintigraphy
should become the gold standard by which other technologies, therapy, and
theoretical considerations of pyelonephritis are measured.

Behavioral consequences of chelator administration in acute cadmium toxicity.

Peele DB(1), Farmer JD, MacPhail RC.

Author information: 
(1)Northrop Services, Inc., Environmental Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina 27709.

The conditioned flavor-aversion paradigm was used to assess the toxicity of
acutely administered cadmium and the interaction of cadmium with the heavy-metal 
chelating agents dimercaprol (BAL) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). Shortly
after consuming saccharin, rats received ip administration of cadmium either
alone or in combination with sc administration of BAL or DMSA. Three days later
they were given the choice between consuming saccharin or water, and saccharin
preferences were recorded. When compared to rats receiving either nothing or the 
vehicle, rats receiving cadmium displayed significant reductions in saccharin
preference (i.e., conditioned flavor aversions). BAL and DMSA were also capable
of producing conditioned flavor aversions when given alone. Rats receiving
cadmium in combination with either BAL or DMSA displayed significant, but not
complete attenuations of conditioned flavor aversions when compared to the flavor
aversions of rats receiving cadmium alone. Chelator-induced blockade of
cadmium-induced flavor-aversion conditioning was not obtained when BAL or DMSA
administration was delayed by 4 hr. Attenuation of cadmium-induced aversions by
BAL and DMSA extends earlier findings of an attenuation of lead-induced
flavor-aversion conditioning by these complexing agents, and thus demonstrates
further the utility of the flavor-aversion conditioning paradigm in
characterizing metal-chelator interactions.

Dose-response study of oral 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in children with elevated
blood lead concentrations.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University College of Physicians and
Surgeons, New York, NY 10032.

2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is an orally effective orphan drug that is
more specific and has a wider therapeutic index than other currently available
drugs used for lead intoxication. Its investigational use in the United States
has been limited to the treatment of men with occupational plumbism. Twenty-one
children with blood lead concentrations of 31 to 49 micrograms/dl, who also had a
positive calcium disodium edetate (CaNa2EDTA) mobilization test result, were
hospitalized for 7 days. Fifteen children were randomly assigned to three groups 
that received either 350, 700, or 1050 mg/m2/day, respectively, of DMSA in three 
divided doses daily. A fourth group of six children received conventional
treatment with 1000 mg/m2/day of intravenously administered CaNa2EDTA in two
divided doses daily. The 1050 mg/m2/day dose of DMSA was significantly more
effective than lower doses of DMSA or intravenously administered CaNa2EDTA in
reducing blood lead levels and restoring erythrocyte delta-aminolevulinic acid
dehydratase activity. Intravenously administered CaNa2EDTA significantly
increased the urinary excretion of several essential minerals (zinc, copper,
iron, and calcium), whereas DMSA did not. The DMSA was well tolerated and appears
extremely promising as a drug that will simplify the management of childhood lead
poisoning.

In order to test in a prospective study the suggestion that there should be a
shift from the intravenous urogram to DMSA scintigraphy for the diagnosis of
suspected renal masses, both investigations were performed in 63 patients with
painless haematuria. While the sensitivity of both investigations was similar in 
renal lesions, specificity was slightly less for scintigraphy. These findings,
together with the intrinsic limitations of the DMSA scintigram in detecting
lesions elsewhere in the urinary tract, lead us to conclude that the intravenous 
urogram should remain the initial investigation for painless haematuria unless
there are specific contraindications.

Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy was used to study the effects 
of partial and complete ureteral obstruction on the porcine kidney; results were 
compared with renal tubular function as determined with technetium-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Twenty-seven pigs were used: nine as
sham-operated controls, six with partial ureteral obstruction, and 12 with
complete ureteral obstruction. P-31 MR spectra and Tc-DMSA scintiscans were
obtained weekly over 3 weeks. Partial obstruction caused no significant change in
P-31 MR spectra, whereas Tc-DMSA scintiscans showed a 74% decrease in tubular
function by the end of 3 weeks. Complete obstruction caused a 43% reduction in
the mean adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to inorganic phosphate (Pi) ratio, which
paralleled the 96% decrease in Tc-DMSA uptake over 3 weeks. The difference in
ATP/Pi ratios between control and completely obstructed kidneys was significant
(P less than .01) at 2 and 3 weeks after ligation. These results indicate that
radionuclide Tc-99m DMSA uptake is very sensitive to the pathophysiologic changes
in renal tubular function, while the organ average cellular bioenergetic state
(ATP/Pi) is not as strongly affected.

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and sodium N-benzyl-N-dithiocarboxy-D-glucamine 
as antagonists for cadmium intoxication.

Orally administered meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is an effective
antagonist for acute oral cadmium chloride (1 mmol/kg) intoxication in mice when 
administered up to 8 h after cadmium ingestion. Administration of sodium
N-benzyl-N-dithiocarboxy-D-glucamine (NaB) i.p. along with DMSA p.o. resulted in 
kidney and liver cadmium levels only marginally smaller than those obtained with 
DMSA alone. Both chelation treatment regimens permitted survival of 80% or more
of the animals, in comparison to a survival rate of 40-50% in untreated animals. 
Intraperitoneally administered NaB by itself is a very effective antagonist for
cadmium chloride administered intraperitoneally in either acute or chronic
cadmium intoxication. A dose-response study was made of the mobilization of
cadmium from the liver and kidney of cadmium-loaded mice by NaB; this showed that
NaB is one of the most effective cadmium mobilizing agents developed to date. We 
have also confirmed the earlier report of Kojima and his co-workers of the
ability of NaB to remove cadmium from animals which have been treated with
cadmium over an extended period of time. NaB causes a very large increase in the 
biliary excretion of cadmium. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of 113Cd
in bile from treated animals and model solutions indicates that such cadmium is
undergoing rapid ligand exchange.

Mobilization of lead over the course of DMSA chelation therapy and long-term
efficacy.

Cory-Slechta DA(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biophysics, University of Rochester, School of Medicine and
Dentistry, New York.

An increasing number of factors suggest that a reevaluation of the current use of
CaNa2EDTA for elevated Pb body burden is advisable and, further, emphasize the
need for alternative safe and efficacious chelating agents. One candidate that
appears to have potential is meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). However,
little is known about the pattern of Pb mobilization or redistribution produced
by this chelator or about its long-term efficacy, issues that were examined in
this study. After a 3- to 4-month exposure to 50 ppm of Pb acetate in drinking
water, different groups of rats received an i.p. injection of saline or 25 or 50 
mg/kg of DMSA once a day for either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 days and were sacrificed 24
hr after the final injection. To assess long-term efficacy of the chelator, an
additional group of rats received five injections (one per day) of 50 mg/kg of
DMSA and were sacrificed 4 months later. Tissue analyses indicated that DMSA
mobilized Pb only from soft tissue, with no loss noted from femur and
consequently no observable redistribution of Pb. Large decrements in blood, brain
and kidney Pb concentrations were noted, with a delayed loss from liver. The
effects were not sustained, however, when assessed 4 months later. With respect
to redistribution of mobilized Pb to critical organs and magnitude of decline in 
soft tissue Pb concentration, DMSA appears to be a safe and particularly
effective chelator and thus may be a viable alternative to CaNa2EDTA.(ABSTRACT

This case report describes the localization and categorization of tumors using
99mTc(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid and [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine scans in a
very uncommon case of medullary thyroid carcinoma associated with
pheochromocytoma (Sipple's syndrome) and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Technetium-99m(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid showed accumulation only in medullary
thyroid carcinoma, but [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine scans were positive in both 
medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma. In advanced Sipple's syndrome, 
combined use of [99mTc(V)]dimercaptosuccinic acid and
[131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine may be useful for the categorization of tumor mass 
lesions and planning appropriate therapy.

[Enhancement of the information value of kidney scintigraphy using 99m Tc-DMSA].

[Article in Russian]

Efimov ON, Volodin VM, Ivanov IuN.

A method of high frequency image filtration improving the quality of imaging, and
more precise renometry with measurement of the total count and the level of RP
kidney accumulation were used for raising the informative value of the results of
renal scintigraphy with 99m Tc-DMSA. 54 patients with unilateral pyelonephritis, 
46--with bilateral pyelonephritis, 15--with nephroptosis, and 10 healthy persons 
were examined. Informative values were calculated on the basis of the results of 
these investigations. The sensitivity of routine renometry was 0.88, its
specificity--0.27 and precision--0.78; the same indices for routine static
scintigraphy were 0.88; 0.4 and 0.84; for modified renal investigations--0.98;
0.77 and 0.96, respectively. The results of the investigations have shown that
the use of scintigraphy with improved quality of kidney images in parallel with
modified renometry raises the informative value of renal studies with 99m Tc-DMSA
and precision of diagnosis of renal parenchymal lesions.

Comparative effects of repeated parenteral administration of several chelators on
the distribution and excretion of cobalt.

Barcelona, Spain.

Effects of repeated ip administration of glutathione, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), 
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), ethylendiamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), and
diethylentriamepentaacetic acid (DTPA) on the distribution and excretion of
cobalt were assessed in Sprague-Dawley rats. Groups of ten animals received
intraperitoneally 0.06 mmol CoCl2/kg/day, three days/week for four weeks. 24 hr
after the last injection, daily chelation therapy was initiated. Rats received
one of the chelators or saline for 5 days. The animals were housed in metabolic
cages and urine and feces were collected daily for 5 days after which time the
rats were killed and the concentration of cobalt was determined in various
tissues. Glutathione, NAC and DTPA significantly increased the excretion of
cobalt into urine whereas EDTA, NAC and DMSA were the most effective chelators
increasing the fecal elimination of cobalt. The concentration of cobalt in the
various tissues was only decreased by NAC (liver and spleen) and glutathione
(spleen). The observed increase in the cobalt excretion with certain chelators
would suggest that increasing the duration of chelation therapy may decrease the 
concentrations of cobalt in tissues and hence, reduce the toxicity of the metal.

Validity of renal split function by single probe renography in hypertensive
patients. A comparison with gamma camera scintigraphy.

Thomsen HS(1), Hvid-Jacobsen K, Nielsen SL.

of Copenhagen, Denmark.

Single kidney function was determined both by single probe renography (131I
hippuran) and gamma camera scintigraphy (99Tcm DMSA) in the sitting position in
42 consecutive patients who were referred to renography as a part of the workup
of their hypertension. The positioning of the detectors turned out to be
satisfactory in 83 per cent of the patients when compared with the determination 
of the split function at scintigraphy. This might be explained by the small 100
per cent isocount area of the probe (avoiding the effect of mobile kidneys) and
by the 4-channel localization system.

Nephroptosis: a cause of renal pain and a potential cause of inaccurate split
renal function determination.

O'Reilly PH(1), Pollard AJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport.

We present 3 cases of nephroptosis encountered in young females over a 6-month
period which posed diagnostic difficulties and gave inaccurate split renal
function determinations until the true situation was disclosed. A syndrome is
described of clinical presentation with right upper quadrant pain, erect hippuran
renography showing an apparently small right kidney and reduced function but with
normal time to peak and elimination phase on the curve (the "miniaturised"
renogram) and erect and supine DMSA scintigraphy which confirms the diagnosis of 
abnormal renal mobility. Guidelines are suggested by which nephroptosis can be
recognised and assessed in urological and nuclear medicine practice.

Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid uptake in long-term catheterized kidney.
Comparison with renal function.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Urology, University of Tokyo, Japan.

We studied 23 long-term catheterized kidneys in 14 patients. The uptake of
99mtechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) was measured at one- and
two-hour intervals after injection, and the uptake was corrected for variations
in renal depth. These values were compared with inulin, creatinine, and
para-amino hippurate (PAH) clearances which were measured in each kidney by
collecting urine through long-term catheterization. Correlation coefficient was
obtained between PAH clearance corrected for the body surface area and the
two-hour uptake of 99mTc-DMSA. The correlation coefficients between the two-hour 
uptake of 99mTc-DMSA and the clearance values are not significantly different
from those between the one-hour uptake and the clearance values. Corrections of
the uptake for variations in renal depth did not improve the correlation
coefficients. The results show that 99mTc-DMSA is an excellent method to estimate
the renal plasma flow and the one-hour uptake without correction for renal depth 
is clinically sufficient to evaluate the split renal function.

New radionuclide tracers for the diagnosis and therapy of medullary thyroid
carcinoma.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a calcitonin-producing tumor that occurs in
familial and sporadic forms, can be monitored satisfactorily with measurements of
calcitonin and CEA in serum. However, locating the tumor site may be difficult.
In the current review of the experience with four new radionuclide tracers for
MTC, the relative value of each of these procedures is outlined. Total body
imaging using TI-201 chloride and Tc-99m(V) DMSA are both sensitive techniques
that can be used for the detection and follow-up of MTC. Imaging using I-131 MIBG
and I-131 anti-CEA antibodies/fragments should be performed once the diagnosis
and the tumor site have been established, to evaluate if patients might be
amenable for therapy with one of these radiopharmaceuticals.

Presidio of San Francisco, CA 94129-6800.

The therapeutic use of disulfhydryl compounds such as 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) for the treatment of heavy metal poisoning has generated a requirement for
specific and sensitive methods to determine those compounds in biological media. 
We have developed a gas chromatographic assay for DMSA in urine. The use of
capillary column technology eliminates the requirement for a preliminary clean-up
step. Samples are first reduced electrochemically to liberate DMSA present as
disulfides. The reduced product is then extracted into ethyl acetate and the
organic phase removed by evaporation. The residue is derivatized with N,O-bis
(trimethylsilyl) acetamide for gas chromatography. The silylated DMSA derivative 
is then detected with a flame ionization detector. The detection limit for DMSA
is 1.9 nmol per 1-microliter aliquot of derivatized extract injected on column
(detector sensitivity at 1.10(-11) A/mV). The utility of the method was
demonstrated by analyzing the urine of rats orally dosed with DMSA.

Considering the favourable nuclear properties of 99Tcm over 67Ga, we have
developed a new tumour-seeking agent, 99Tc(V)m dimercaptosuccinic acid
(Tc(V)-DMSA). In order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of Tc(V)-DMSA
scintigraphies, 492 patients were studied with Tc(V)-DMSA, and in some cases,
where possible, the results were compared with conventional 67Ga citrate
scintigraphies. There was a high degree of usefulness of Tc(V)-DMSA in patients
with head and neck tumours, medullary thyroid carcinomas and soft tissue tumours.
But in patients with carcinomas of the lung, liver and gastrointestinal tract,
malignant melanoma and lymphoma, Tc(V)-DMSA was of no or little use.

Chelation in metal intoxication. XXVII: Chelating agents containing vicinal
thioether groups as antidotes of lead toxicity.

Tandon SK(1), Sharma BL, Singh S.

Author information: 
(1)Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, Lucknow, India.

The chelating agents containing vicinal thioether groups viz.
4,5-dicarboxy-3,6-dithiaoctanedioic acid (DMSA), disodium-3,6-dithia -
1,8-octanediol-4,5 dicarboxylate (DMES) and 2,9 diamino- 5,6 dicarboxy-4,7
dithiadecanedioic acid (DCSA) were about equally effective but far more effective
than pounds-mercapto- beta -(2-thienyl) acrylic acid (MTA) in enhancing excretion
of lead, reversing certain Pb induced biochemical alterations and mobilizing
tissue Pb in poisoned rats. The results indicate that vicinal thioether groups
participate in chelation of Pb. However, none of them could decrease brain Pb.
Owing to their water solubility, low toxicity and ability to chelate toxic
metals, the chelators with vicinal thioether groups appear as promising antidotes
of Pb intoxication.

Barcelona, Reus, Spain.

Sixteen chelating agents were examined to determine their relative efficacy as
antidotes in acute zinc acetate intoxication in mice after i.p. administration.
For a i.p. dose of 0.49 mmol/kg (LD50) of zinc acetate, the i.p. administration
of chelating agents at a 2:1 and 5:1 mole ratio resulted in a significant
antidotal action for EDTA, DTPA, CDTA, D-penicillamine (D-PA), DMPS and DMSA.
EGTA, L-cysteine, triethylentetraamine (TTHA), N-acetylcysteine (NAC),
4,5-dihydroxi-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid (Tiron), sodium salicylate, glutathione,
sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), 6-mercaptopurine and N-acetyl-D,
L-penicillamine (NAPA) were not effective for acute zinc acetate poisoning. The
therapeutic indices and therapeutic effectiveness of the most effective chelators
were, respectively: EDTA (5.0, 7.0), DTPA (7.3, 13.7), CDTA (8.6, 6.3), D-PA
(4.6, 1.9), DMPS (1.3, 1.0), DMSA (3.2, 5.4). DTPA, CDTA, and EDTA appear to be
the most effective agents of those tested in offsetting acute zinc intoxication
in mice.

Two routes for 99mTc-DMSA uptake into the renal cortical tubular cell.

Comment in
    Eur J Nucl Med. 1989;15(9):633.

Critical factors determining the renal handling of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA) are protein binding in plasma and the renal 99mTc-DMSA extraction
efficiency. Comparison of the count rate over soft tissue with that over the
cardiac blood pool about 1 h after injection demonstrated that 99mTc-DMSA is not 
exclusively an intravascular label. 99mTc-DMSA was 76% protein bound in plasma as
demonstrated by HPLC and gel filtration. Assuming that the 24% that is not
protein bound is filtered at the glomerulus, the renal extraction efficiency of
99mTc-DMSA by glomerular filtration is about 5%. Since the total renal extraction
efficiency was also found to be about 5%, the majority of the activity that
becomes fixed in the renal cortex arrives there as a result of filtration
followed by tubular reabsorption rather than by direct extraction from
peritubular blood. However, discordant changes in DMSA and DTPA uptake induced by
captopril in renovascular hypertension (RVH) suggested that a minority of uptake 
was by direct peritubular extraction. This kinetic model was supported by
indirect measurement of protein binding and extraction efficiency based on the
kinetics of 99mTc-DMSA disappearance from plasma and kinetics of uptake in the
kidneys. Furthermore, differential functional studies based on 99mTc-DMSA and
99mTc-DTPA before and after captopril in patients with RVH due to unilateral
renal artery stenosis confirmed filtration followed by tubular reabsorption as
the predominant route for DMSA uptake by the kidney.

The effect of radiopharmaceutical choice on the assessment of the relative renal

The relative function of the obstructed kidney (RFOK) was assessed in 43 adult
patients with upper urinary tract obstruction (UUTO) using 99mTc-DTPA and
131I-ortho-iodohippurate (OIH) dynamic studies and 99mTc-DMSA dynamic and static 
studies. The patients were divided into five groups according to the duration and
degree of obstruction. Findings were as follows: a) in patients with the first
occurrence of acute severe obstruction (group 1), the relative glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) was significantly less than the relative effective renal
plasma flow (ERPF); b) in patients with chronic severe obstruction and long term 
uroinfection, the relative ERPF decreased significantly compared with the
relative GFR; c) the RFOK calculated from the DMSA dynamic study was the same as 
both the relative GFR or ERPF in any group; d) the RFOK calculated from the DMSA 
static study seemed to parallel the relative ERPF more closely than the relative 
GFR, but in group one it was significantly higher than any of three other
estimates. It is concluded that 99mTc-DTPA is the radiopharmaceutical of choice
in obstructive uronephropathy, but when interpreting the RFOK, the time course
and severity of obstruction, the presence or absence of uroinfection should also 
be considered.

carcinoma of the thyroid and its metastases. There were 15 patients with proved
medullary carcinoma and 6 patients with other differentiated thyroid carcinoma.
Amongst the 15 patients with medullary carcinoma, 12 (80%) showed positive
localisation either in the primary or one or more metastatic sites. None of the
six patients with carcinoma other than medullary showed increased concentration
of 99mTc(V)-DMSA. Of the 37 known metastatic sites in 15 patients with medullary 
carcinoma, 24 showed concentration of 99mTc(V)-DMSA (64.9%). In addition,
99mTc(V)-DMSA concentration was seen in 14 sites where no evidence of metastasis 
was revealed. The incidence of 99mTc(V)-DMSA concentration in soft tissue and
bone metastasis was similar.

Antagonists for acute oral cadmium chloride intoxication.

Basinger MA(1), Jones MM, Holscher MA, Vaughn WK.

Author information:

An examination has been carried out on the relative efficacy of a number of
chelating agents when acting as antagonists for oral cadmium chloride
intoxication in mice. The compounds were administered orally after the oral
administration of cadmium chloride at 1 mmol/kg. Of the compounds examined,
several were useful in terms of enhancing survival, but by far the most effective
in both enhancing survival and leaving minimal residual levels of cadmium in the 
liver and the kidney, was meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). Several
polyaminocarboxylic acids also enhanced survival. The most effective of these in 
reducing liver and kidney levels of cadmium were diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid (DTPA), trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetic acid (CDTA), and
triethylenetetraminehexaacetic acid (TTHA). D-Penicillamine (DPA) was found to
promote survival but also led to kidney cadmium levels higher than those found in
the controls. Sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) was as effective in
promoting survival as DMSA but left levels of cadmium in the kidney and liver
that were approximately four times greater than those found with DMSA.

Pentavalent [99mTc]DMSA, [131I]MIBG, and [99mTc]MDP--an evaluation of three
imaging techniques in patients with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.

Clarke SE(1), Lazarus CR, Wraight P, Sampson C, Maisey MN.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Guy's Hospital, London, England.

Nine patients with histologically proven medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MCT)
were imaged using pentavalent [99mTc]dimercaptosuccinic acid [(V)DMSA], [131I]
metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and [99mTc]methylene diphosphonate (MDP).
Technetium-99m (V)DMSA demonstrated most of the tumor sites in eight patients
with proven metastases, with an overall sensitivity of 95% in lesion detection.
Iodine-131 MIBG showed definite uptake in some of the tumor sites in three of the
nine patients imaged, with equivocal uptake seen in a further one patient, with
sensitivity of only 11% for lesion detection. Technetium-99m MDP demonstrated
bony metastases only, in four of the patients imaged yielding a sensitivity of
61%. Technetium-99m (V)DMSA has been demonstrated in this study to be a useful
imaging agent in patients with MCT, showing uptake in significantly more lesions 
and with better imaging qualities than [131I]MIBG, and with the ability to detect
soft tissue as well as bony metastases.

A study on the effect of garlic to the heavy metal poisoning of rat.

Cha CW(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University,
Seoul.

When garlic (Allium sativum) was administered to rat per os simultaneously with
cadmium, methylmercury and phenylmercury to detect the protective effect against 
the heavy metal poisoning, accumulation of heavy metals in liver, kidneys, bone
and testes were decreased, and histopathological damages and the inhibition of
serum alkaline phosphatase activities by heavy metals were reduced. Such effect
of garlic was not shown in the 1.7% garlic treated group and most remarkable in
the 6.7% garlic treated group. The protective effect of garlic was superior to
those of 2,3 dimercapto-1-propanol (BAL) and D-penicillamine (PEN), and nearly
similar to those of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and
N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (APEN), the current remedies, while garlic was not
effective as a curative agent for heavy metal poisoning. The excretion of cadmium
was enhanced, more through feces than urine by garlic but the effect to the
urinary excretion of cadmium was not significant comparing with DMSA or APEN when
cadmium was ip injected in the first 3 days during the 12 days of oral
administration of DMSA, APEN or garlic.

[Assessment of obstructive nephropathy using diuretic 99mTc-DTPA renogram and
99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy].

[Article in Japanese]

99mTc-DMSA and diuretic 99mTc-DTPA renoscintigraphy were performed on 51 kidneys 
suspected of obstructive nephropathy based on excretory urography to evaluate the
residual renal function and the degree of urinary flow impairment respectively.
We classified the response to diuretics into 6 patterns: I. normal, IIa. severely
damaged renal function, IIb. slow RI excretion without urinary tract
visualization (pattern II had no response to furosemide), IIIa. rapid elimination
of tracer from the obstructed upper tract, IIIb. slow elimination, and IV.
gradual tracer accumulation in the pelvicalyceal system with fairly well
preserved renal function but no response. Hydronephrosis varied according to
pattern type, in the ascending order of I, IIIa, IIIb and IV (p less than 0.05). 
Degree of hydronephrosis was inversely related to 99mTc-DMSA uptake, but without 
statistical significance. 99mTc-DMSA uptake was lower for pattern III as a whole 
(IIIa + (IIIb) than for pattern I (p less than 0.005), but there was no
difference between IIIa and IIIb. Pattern IIa exhibited a significantly lower
uptake than any of the other groups. (p less than 0.005) In contrast to previous 
views, we believe that pattern IIIa indicates a mild obstruction of urinary flow 
and impaired renal function. Consequently, assessment of obstructive nephropathy 
should not be based only on urodynamic study but also on differential renal
function test.

An evaluation of the uptake of technetium-99m (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid in
patients with squamous carcinoma of the head and neck.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Guy's Hospital, London.

A new imaging agent, Technetium-99m (Tc99m) (v) Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),
has recently been developed which has been used to evaluate head and neck
tumours. Twenty-four patients were studied of whom 21 had histologically proven
SCC of the head and neck. The remaining 3 had benign lesions. Planar imaging of
patients with primary disease revealed a sensitivity of 83% and a 75%
specificity. The results of planar imaging of patients with cervical metastases
yielded a 92% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Seven patients also had single
photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) which improved the image quality,
spatial resolution and sensitivity of the investigation. Tc99m (v) DMSA imaging
provides a cheap and rapid means of investigating head and neck SCC. This study
suggests further work is indicated to assess its role in diagnosis and subsequent
management.

To determine renal function, 99mTc-DMSA renal uptake was measured from renal
tomographic images obtained by single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT). A total of 77 tests was conducted on 73 patients with various diseases
in the kidneys and urinary tract to determine renal uptake. The correlation
coefficient(r) between total renal volume and total renal uptake was 0.3509 and
that between renal volume and uptake of 143 kidneys was 0.5433. In 62 patients
whose creatinine clearance could be measured, the correlation coefficient between
creatinine clearance and total renal volume was 0.2352, and that between
creatinine clearance and total renal uptake was 0.8854, that is, creatinine
clearance correlated well with renal uptake. Renal volume and uptake determined
in 10 normal male and 10 normal female adults were 220 ml and 26.8% for the right
kidney and 239 ml and 27.6% for the left kidney for the males and 206 ml and
26.4% (right) and 237 ml and 27.9% (left) for the females. This method, which
requires no blood or urine collection, is very useful as an individual kidney
function test to evaluate individual kidney function and to understand kidney
function before and after operation in patients with renal and urinary diseases.

Relative and absolute 99Tcm-DMSA uptake measurements in normal and obstructed
kidneys.

Zananiri MC(1), Jarritt PH, Sarfarazi M, Ell PJ.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College, London, UK.

Relative and absolute 99Tcm-DMSA uptake measurements were carried out on 25 adult
patients among whom there were 23 normal and 25 malfunctioning kidneys. Data were
collected at 3 and 6 h post intravenous tracer injection. Four methods of
calculating absolute uptake were investigated and evaluated. These were based on:
(1) posterior view and measured kidney depth; (2) posterior view and Raynauld's
depth; (3) geometric mean assuming kidney thickness is small enough not to
introduce self attenuation of counts in the kidney itself; (4) geometric mean
taking kidney thickness into account. Whilst (1) and (2) were found to
overestimate and underestimate renal uptake by up to 5 and 14%, respectively, (3)
and (4) were found to be more accurate and comparable. The measurement of
relative DMSA uptake (right to left) showed no change between the 1 and 6 h
measurements for both obstructed and non-obstructed kidneys. Based on the results
from method 4, the absolute renal DMSA uptake had a mean value of 25.4%, S.D.
8.9% and 30.0%, S.D. 9.2% at 3 and 6 h, respectively, for normal/non obstructed
kidneys. For obstructed kidneys (responding to frusemide), the mean uptake was
23.0%, S.D. 7.2 and 25.6%, S.D. 6.7% at 3 and 6 h, respectively. For obstructed
kidneys not responding to frusemide, the mean uptake was 16.8%, S.D. 3.9 and
20.6%, S.D. 4.8% at 3 and 6 h, respectively. No correlation was found between
absolute DMSA uptake and degree of renal obstruction.

The determination of relative kidney function in obstructive uropathy with
99Tcm-DMSA.

Hospital Leiden, The Netherlands.

In this investigation differential kidney function studies were carried out for
eight patients with obstructive uropathy and seven patients who did not suffer
from obstruction. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether possible
retention of 99Tcm-DMSA in the dilated system would lead to overestimation of the
functional mass of an obstructed kidney. The clinical examination took place 4
and 24 h after i.v. injection of the 99Tcm-DMSA. From our results we conclude
that this is not a major problem. It appeared that the 4 h values are as reliable
as the 24 h values in the clinical situation.

Tissue decorporation of polonium-210 in rats by DMPA.

Author information: 
(1)University Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of
Arizona, Tucson 85721.

Polonium-210 exposures, although rare, have occurred due to accidents in nuclear 
working environments. This alpha emitting radioactive element can bind thiols and
thiol-containing proteins in vivo. Since thiol-containing chelating agents
compete with many thiols for heavy metals, a number of these chelating agents
have been investigated as protective agents against the lethal effects of 210Po
and as tissue decorporating agents for it. Rats given 210Po (40 microCi/kg) ip
had a median survival time (mst) of 39 days. The mst was increased to 106 days
when N-(2,3-dimercaptopropyl)phthalamidic acid (DMPA), meso-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) or the Na salt of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) was
administered sc (p less than .002). Decorporation studies were performed by
giving rats 210Po (0.4 microCi) sc, followed by a series of thiol injections
beginning one hour later. After 21 days, kidney levels of 210Po in rats given
DMPA were only 28% of those of the untreated controls and significantly lower
than those receiving DMSA, DMPS, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, or WR2721. After DMPA
treatment, the 210Po levels of the spleen were 25% of the saline-treated control.
DMPA appears to be a new and consistent decorporating agent for polonium-210.

The role of technetium-99m pentavalent DMSA in the management of patients with
medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.

In order to assess the role of 99Tcm pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid (99Tcm
(V)DMSA) scanning in the management of patients with medullary carcinoma of the
thyroid, we imaged 10 patients with histologically proven disease. Nine of the 10
patients were scanned after removal of the primary tumour, but with symptomatic
or biochemical evidence of recurrence. One patient was imaged prior to
thyroidectomy. In eight of the 10 patients 99Tcm(V)DMSA successfully identified
tumour deposits, and it has been shown in this study to be a cheap, convenient
radiopharmaceutical for studying this group of patients, producing high-quality
images with low radiation doses, and contributing significantly to patient
management.

Renal scarring secondary to vesicoureteric reflux. Critical assessment and new
grading.

One hundred and fifty children with proven urinary tract infection who were
assessed by renal ultrasound (U/S), intravenous urography (IVU) and
dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc DMSA) scan, were studied to identify the
sensitivity of each examination and the pick-up rate of renal scarring secondary 
to vesicoureteric reflux. Sixty-three of these children who had the examinations 
carried out within a 6-month period were assessed in detail. A DMSA scan is the
most accurate method of detecting early renal scars in the young age group (0-2
and 2-5 years), followed by ultrasound. The examinations are equally sensitive
over the age of 5. A new grading system of the severity of renal scarring is
presented.

[Scintigraphic localization of the liver and kidneys for abdominal radiotherapy: 
methods, accuracy and comparison with the ultrasonic procedure].

[Article in German]

Fritz P(1), Schulz-Wendtland R, Kuttig H.

Author information: 
(1)Universitäts-Strahlenklinik Heidelberg.

The exposure of liver and kidney has to be avoided when irradiation fields for
radiotherapy of the abdomen are planned and adjusted, unless these organs
themselves are the target of therapeutic procedure. A scintigraphic method is
presented which allows to transfer the site and borderlines of the organs to the 
body surface taking exactly into account the irradiation position. A precise
transfer of site, size, and shape of the organs facilitates the adjustment of
irradiation fields or the positioning of satellite field stops. Scintigraphic
organ localization is performed by means of static liver or kidney scintigraphy
with suitable radiocolloids for the liver and 99mTc DMSA for the kidneys. The
scintigraphic procedure meets all practical requirements regarding the precision 
of organ localization and shows evident advantages compared to X-ray and
ultrasonographic methods. It can be performed at every department of nuclear
medicine without preparing the patient and is not influenced by intestinal air
artefacts, skeletal parts, obesity, or dystopic organ sites. The results of
scintigraphic and ultrasonographic kidney localisation are compared in 15
patients. The scintigraphic procedure has shown to be superior, even with regard 
to precision and possibility of variable projections to the body surface.

Combination of DMSA-scintigraphy and hippuran renography in unilateral
obstructive nephropathy. Improved prediction of recovery after intervention.

Thomsen HS(1), Hvid-Jacobsen K, Meyhoff HH, Nielsen SL.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Københavns Amts Sygehus i Herlev, University
of Copenhagen, Denmark.

The renal handling of dimercaptosuccinic acid and hippuran differs. This might be
used in unilateral obstructive nephropathy in order to predict potential
functional recovery following intervention. The theory was evaluated on a
retrospective basis in 17 patients, who primarily had a nephrostomy. If the
DMSA-uptake rate in the diseased kidney was more than 10 per cent higher than
that of hippuran, the uptake rate of hippuran increased following relief of
obstruction. Use of the two radiopharmaceuticals, thus, may have great impact on 
the clinical decision, since in case of a difference some function may be saved
by immediate intervention.

The importance of using anterior and posterior views in the calculation of

(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Manchester Royal Infirmary.

Radionuclide techniques for determining relative renal function are well
established. One simple method uses the count rate from static images obtained
using 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). We have reviewed 277 DMSA scans and
shown that it is important to obtain the geometric mean of counts from the
anterior and posterior views in order to correct for the different amounts of
attenuation for each kidney. If counts were obtained from the posterior view
only, erroneous results would be obtained in 8% of children under 13 years, in
28% of patients aged between 13 and 20 years and in 32% of patients over 20 years
of age.

Measurement of relative renal function. A comparison of methods and assessment of
reproducibility.

Nimmo MJ(1), Merrick MV, Allan PL.

Author information: 
(1)Nuclear Medicine Department, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh.

A good correlation was found between relative uptake of 99Tcm dimercaptosuccinic 
acid (DMSA) and relative 131I orthoiodohippuric acid clearance in a group of 100 
consecutive patients without evidence of renal failure. In the majority,
attenuation correction was found to make no significant difference to relative
function measurement. Those in whom it did could be readily identified by
inspection of the posterior DMSA images at the time of examination. Two hundred
patients were reviewed in whom serial studies had been performed over the
previous 5 years. Differences in relative function greater than 5% indicated a
high probability that a real change in renal function had occurred. We conclude
that whilst renography and DMSA scintigraphy yield complementary information,
relative function (L/L + R) can be measured equally well by either method, and
the results are sufficiently reproducible to be clinically useful.

Transitional nephrology seriously affects the manner in which radiological
investigations and other forms of imaging are undertaken in the neonate. When
this is complicated by acute renal failure then caution must be exerted in taking
care of the neonate. The use of ultrasound and micturating cystourethrography are
well described and form the baseline for all imaging of the renal tract. The
physiological handling of TC99m DTPA and the contrasts used for IVU are described
as well as the normal appearances of these techniques in the neonate. TC99m DMSA 
is also included, as are other modalities of imaging.

Myocardial infarct imaging in patients with technetium-99m 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid. Superiority of technetium-99m pyrophosphate.

Lyons KP, Milne N, Karlsberg RP, Olson HG, Kuperus J.

Technetium-99m 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99m DMSA) has been used
successfully for imaging acute myocardial infarction in a canine model. The
application in humans, however, has not been previously reported. In order to
determine the feasibility of using this agent in clinical studies and to compare 
the agent to technetium-99m pyrophosphate (Tc-99m PPi), ten patients with proven 
myocardial infarction were studied. While imaging of transmural infarctions in
humans was achieved using Tc-99m DMSA, scores for the Tc-99m DMSA images (1.8 +/-
0.96) were not as high as for Tc-99m PPi (2.5 +/- 0.45) (P less than 0.05).
Discordance among four independent interpreters was greater for images obtained
with Tc-99m DMSA. The superiority of Tc-99m PPi was evident whether images were
obtained early (within 24 hours) or late (within five days). Although DMSA images
were not obscured by rib uptake, they were less sensitive (63%) than Tc-99m PPi
(97%). A potential advantage of Tc-99m DMSA in imaging acute myocardial
infarction is that radiotracer concentration in the infarct occurs primarily in
the early postinfarction period. The longer postinfarction that Tc-99m DMSA
imaging was attempted, the lower the concentration of radiotracer. Thus, Tc-99m
DMSA would not be expected to have the same persistence pattern as Tc-99m PPi
into the remote postinfarction period. The persistent positivity of Tc-99m PPi
has made it difficult to diagnose reinfarction.

99mTc-glucoheptonate for quantitation of differential renal function.

Ziessman HA, Balseiro J, Fahey FH, Le TV, Dubiansky V.

Differential renal function was calculated by using 99mTc-glucoheptonate (Tc-GH) 
in 51 patients. Computer-acquired background-corrected individual renal function 
was calculated by using both the 1-3-min uptake counts and the 2-4-hr delayed
static counts. The degree of correlation between the two was high (r = .96). An
equally high correlation was noted in 16 children who were 12 years old or
younger, in 15 patients with renal size disparity greater than 60/40%, and in six
patients with abnormal creatinine clearances. Ten patients had a 30-min dynamic
99mTc-DTPA study followed immediately by the injection of Tc-GH and acquisition
of delayed static images 2-4 hr later. A high degree of correlation (r = .99) was
seen between the 1-3-min differential function obtained by using Tc-DTPA and the 
2-4-hr delayed differential function obtained by using Tc-GH. This study shows
that Tc-GH is a clinically useful and valid tool for calculation of differential 
renal function and that Tc-GH combines many of the best aspects of Tc-DTPA and
Tc-DMSA.

Evaluation of renal parenchyma in children by DMSA scintigraphy, X-ray computed
tomography and intravenous urography.

Kullendorff CM, Laurin S, White T.

The demonstration of diminished or scarred renal parenchyma in children is often 
the decisive factor in determining the future management of children with urinary
tract malformations. Renal scintigraphy using technetium 99m-labelled
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), computed tomography (CT) and intravenous
urography (IU) were used to evaluate the renal parenchyma prior to ureter
re-implantation in a series of 13 children. Their ages ranged from 5 months to 3 
years 8 months. The indication for operation was ureteric reflux in 8 children
and distal ureteric stenosis in 5. CT was performed on a Toshiba TCT-80 scanner. 
Renal scintigraphy was performed 3 hours after intravenous injection of DMSA.
Compared with IU, DMSA imaging gave more information about the renal parenchyma
in 6 children, gave equal information in 6 and less in 1. Compared with CT, DMSA 
imaging gave more information in 2 children, was equally informative in 8 and
less so in 3. Accordingly, DMSA imaging was judged to be more sensitive than IU
and as sensitive as CT. DMSA imaging can be used both for the initial evaluation 
and for follow-up assessment of renal parenchymal damage.

Twelve chelating agents were administered to mice by IP injection to compare
their relative effectiveness in preventing death after a single IP injection of
gallium nitrate. Na2Ca-ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA),
Na3Ca-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),
4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene-disulfonic acid (Tiron), sodium diethyldithiocarbamate 
(DDC), L-cysteine and sodium salicylate were not effective for acute gallium
nitrate intoxication. The therapeutic indices of the effective chelators were:
25.4 (deferoxamine mesylate), 35.7 (citric acid), 42.3 (succinic acid), 52.2
(malic acid) and 111.1 (oxalic acid).

The authors report a survey of the French Group of Visceral Pediatric Surgery,
concerning 985 congenital anomalies of the pyeloureteric junction in 883
children. 67.3% of them are boys. This article stresses the recent improvements
in prenatal ultrasonography and diagnosis which is now able to individualize a
homogeneous group of asymptomatic children ready to be repaired in the early
post-natal period. Early reconstruction is associated with the greatest degree of
recovery of renal function. In children, the average age is 4 years 9 months at
diagnosis. In 43.6% clinical symptoms suggest an infectious problem. Pain is
noted in 35.5% and an abdominal mass is discovered in 13.3%. Excretory urography 
(IVP), ultrasonography and cystography are still the main investigations to be
done in all cases. But it is now necessary to use modern isotopic technics such
as DMSA and diuretic DTPA to quantify obstruction with accuracy and follow
long-term evolution after treatment. Treatment is surgical and conservative in
81.4%. Almost all of the uretero-pyeloplasties are performed according to the
dismembered technic usually with temporary nephrostomy drainage. Renal reduction 
is reserved only for the redundant and decompensated renal pelvis. Morbidity is
low (2.5%) and good results can be expected in about 95% of cases.

Investigation and management of hypertension in children. A personal perspective.

Dillon MJ(1).

Author information: 
(1)Renal Unit, Hospital for Sick Children, London, UK.

The prevalence of hypertension in children is of the order of 1%-3%. Of these
children, 10% will have severe hypertension and in the majority the increased
blood pressure will be secondary to renal disease. Nephrologically orientated
investigation is therefore important. The most helpful investigations are:
peripheral plasma-renin activity, 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, main
and segmental renal vein renin measurements and renal angiography plus 123I
metaiodobenzyl guanidine (MIBG) scan in suspected phaeochromocytoma. Drug
treatment of accelerated hypertension is most successfully undertaken by
intravenous labetalol or sodium nitroprusside; sustained moderate-to-severe
hypertension by a beta-blocker plus a vasodilator or an angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitor with or without a diuretic; mild hypertension by diet, diuretic 
and if necessary by more powerful hypotensives. Surgical treatment by
revascularization or nephrectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can be
successful. Utilizing the current range of investigational and therapeutic tools 
the aetiology and appropriate management of hypertension can be effectively and
safely undertaken in the majority of hypertensive children.

Meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in the diagnosis and treatment of lead
poisoning.

Bentur Y, Brook JG, Behar R, Taitelman U.

Lead poisoning remains one of the hazards of industrialized civilization. CaNa2
EDTA and dimercaprol, the usual therapeutic measures, have many side effects and 
can be given by parenteral route alone. The authors present a case of chronic
lead poisoning caused by ingestion of contaminated flour ground in a primitive
flour mill. The diagnosis was confirmed by the CaNa2 EDTA provocative test.
Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was given orally as a further provocation and
resulted in an 11-fold increase in urinary lead excretion. A 5-day course of
treatment with DMSA was instituted, during which symptoms abated, urinary lead
excretion increased and the blood lead level decreased. No side effects were
noticed. There has been no relapse over several months of follow-up. The authors 
conclude that the oral use of DMSA is effective, safe and convenient both as a
provocative test in establishing the diagnosis of lead poisoning and as a
therapeutic tool.

Preparation and evaluation of 99mTc(V)-DMSA complex: studies in medullary
carcinoma of thyroid.

Ramamoorthy N, Shetye SV, Pandey PM, Mani RS, Patel MC, Patel RB, Ramanathan P,
Krishna BA, Sharma SM.

Consequent to the promising results reported with 99mTc(V)-DMSA for imaging
certain types of soft tissue tumors, we have developed methods to prepare this
radiopharmaceutical in three ways: from freshly prepared reagents, through the
use of a two component kit and use of the standard renal DMSA kit by a modified
recipe. The 99mTc(V)-DMSA complex has been subjected to paper electrophoretic and
chromatographic procedures and also biodistribution studies. The distinctly
different behaviour of this new product compared to that of the well known renal 
DMSA complex has been clearly established. Scintiimaging in a preliminary
clinical trial in patients with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid has been
encouraging.

99Tcm-DMSA uptake in obstructed kidneys. How inaccurate are the 5 h measurements?

Verboven M, Ham HR, Josephson S, Collier F, Hall M, Piepsz A.

Partial obstruction of the left ureter was created in 19 rats and a relative
99Tcm-DMSA uptake was obtained 5 and 24 h after intravenous injection of the
tracer. A systematic and variable overestimation of the left to right uptake
ratio was found at 5 h, with a mean error of 15.8% (S.D. = 12.2).

Determination and metabolism of dithiol-chelating agents: electrolytic and
chemical reduction of oxidized dithiols in urine.

Maiorino RM, Barry TJ, Aposhian HV.

The presence of oxidized species of the dithiol-chelating agents,
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid
(DMPS), in human urine was determined by chemical and electrolytic reduction
methods. Urine from a human given either DMSA or DMPS was treated with
electrolysis, dithiothreitol, or sodium tetrahydridoborate (NaBH4). The SH groups
were derivatized with monobromobimane for the determination of unaltered
dithiols. Total dithiol (unaltered and oxidized) was determined by reduction
followed by derivatization with monobromobimane. The bimane derivatives were
identified and quantified by HPLC and fluorescence. Although all three reduction 
methods gave similar results, electrolytic reduction of oxidized DMSA and
chemical reduction with NaBH4 of oxidized DMPS are recommended based upon both
day to day reproducibility and recovery of standards. After reduction a 4-fold
increase in DMSA and a 20-fold increase in DMPS were found in urine by 12 h after
an oral dose of DMSA or DMPS. These new methods for the determination of dithiols
and their oxidized forms should lead to a better understanding of the metabolic
properties of these increasingly important orally effective chelating agents.

Comparison of two 99mTc(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid preparations.

Jeghers O, Puttemans N, Urbain D, Lefebvre J, Ham HR.

99mTc(V)-DMSA labelled either by increasing the pH together with a low
concentration of Sn, or by increasing the pH only are compared in vitro and in
vivo. The gel chromatographic separation shows that after incubation with blood, 
all the 99mTc(V)-DMSA preparations are stable and do not bind to the plasma
proteins. The behavior in rats as well as in clinical studies does not
demonstrate any distinctive characteristics between the different radiomolecules.
It seems that the pH of the solution is an important factor which controls the
formation of 99mTc(V)-DMSA.

Genovesi-Ebert A.

Author information:

Aim of the study was to evaluate the renal responses to physical and mental
effort in essential hypertension by means of a non-invasive radioisotopic method.
Renal uptake rate of Tc99m-DMSA was evaluated in 10 subjects. Starting from 5 to 
15 minutes after dose injection counts over the kidney region were acquired by
means of a gamma-camera time-activity curves were obtained for each kidney. In
non-stimulated patients DMSA uptake rate increased regularly; in the remaining
cases both isometric exercise and mental effort induced an abrupt reduction of
the uptake rate which increased again after the end of the test. Although the
relation of DMSA uptake rate to renal function is not yet fully understood, we
tentatively interpret these results as indicating blood flow reductions during
these stressful conditions.

Cysteine analogues potentiate glucose-induced insulin release in vitro.

Ammon HP, Hehl KH, Enz G, Setiadi-Ranti A, Verspohl EJ.

In rat pancreatic islets, cysteine analogues, including glutathione,
acetylcysteine, cysteamine, D-penicillamine, L-cysteine ethyl ester, and
cysteine-potentiated glucose (11.1 mM) induced insulin secretion in a
concentration-dependent manner. Their maximal effects were similar and occurred
at approximately 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0 mM, respectively. At
substimulatory glucose levels (2.8 mM), insulin release was not affected by these
compounds. In contrast, thiol compounds, structurally different from cysteine and
its analogues, such as mesna, tiopronin, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),
dimercaprol (BAL), beta-thio-D-glucose, as well as those cysteine analogues that 
lack a free-thiol group, including L-cystine, cystamine, D-penicillamine
disulfide, S-carbocysteine, and S-carbamoyl-L-cysteine, did not enhance insulin
release at stimulatory glucose levels (11.1 mM); cystine (5 mM) was inhibitory.
These in vitro data indicate that among the thiols tested here, only cysteine and
its analogues potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion, whereas thiols that
are structurally not related to cysteine do not. This suggests that a cysteine
moiety in the molecule is necessary for the insulinotropic effect. For their
synergistic action to glucose, the availability of a sulfhydryl group is also a
prerequisite. The maximal synergistic action is similar for all cysteine
analogues tested, whereas the potency of action is different, suggesting
similarity in the mechanism of action but differences in the affinity to the
secretory system.

The effectiveness of Tc-99m bleomycin (BLM) and Tc(V)-99m DMSA are compared with 
that of Ga-67 citrate, which is currently the most widely used agent. In four
patients with lipomatous tumors, the clinical significance of tumor imaging with 
each of these three agents is discussed and compared. Results indicate that both 
Tc-99m BLM and Tc(V)-99m DMSA are superior in detecting the extension or

Encephalopathy in renovascular hypertension associated with the use of oral
contraceptives.

Bradley JR, Reynolds J, Williams PF, Appleton DS.

Two female patients aged 19 years and 27 years presented with hypertensive
encephalopathy and were subsequently found to have renal artery stenosis due to
fibromuscular dysplasia. Both patients had had normal blood pressures recorded
within the previous 6 months whilst taking the oral contraceptive pill. Their
neurological state returned to normal with hypertensive control and in one case
the hypertension was cured by dilatation of the renal artery stenosis by balloon 
angioplasty.

PIP: 2 cases reports are described of patients with renal artery stenosis who
presented with hypertensive encephalopathy, normal blood pressures having been
recorded within the previous 6 months while taking oral contraceptives (OCs). A
27-year-old woman, admitted to the hospital following 2 grand mal fits, had
suffered from increasing headaches, nausea, and vomiting over the previous month.
Her blood pressure had been elevated at 160/110 mmHg 1 week prior to admission
but had been normal over previous 11 years while taking OCs (various formulations
of combined estrogen and progestogen) which she had stopped taking 2 months
previously. She was a nonsmoker. Her blood pressure was controlled with atenolol,
nifedipine, and bendrofluazide, and her conscious level returned to normal with
no further fits. An intravenous urogram revealed a small left kidney with a
delayed nephrogram, and subsequent arteriography showed bilateral medial
fibromuscular dysplasia with a narrow stenosis of the left renal artery.
Attempted balloon angioplasty was unsuccessful due to arterial spasm. 4 months
after presentation she became pregnant. Blood pressure was controlled with methyl
dopa during pregnancy which progressed uneventfully to full term. In the 2nd
case, a 19-year old girl became confused and suffered a grand mal convulsion. She
had complained of headaches over the previous 3 days. Her blood pressure had been
normal over the previous 6 months while taking Logynon (phased formulation of
ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel). She was a nonsmoker. On admission to the
hospital, she suffered further generalized convulsions. Despite control of her
convulsions with intravenous chlormethiazole, her blood pressure rose to 220/140 
mmHg, and this was controlled with intravenous hydralazine and propranolol. The
following day she was conscious and was changed to oral therapy. A renogram and
DMSA scan showed normal sized kidneys, but there was evidence of decreased blood 
flow to the left kidney with an increased transit time. Renal arteriography
showed a stenosis of the left renal artery, typical of intimal fibromuscular
dysplasia, which was dilated by balloon angioplasty. Anti-hypertensive medication
was withdrawn postoperatively, and her blood pressure has remained well
controlled. In both of the cases the onset of hypertension was rapid with
encephalopathy being the presenting feature. Hypertensive encephalopathy is well 
recognized as a presenting feature of renal transplant artery stenosis but not in
cases of native renal artery stenosis. 1 of the patients had stopped using OCs 2 
months before presentation, suggesting that although there may have been an
association between OC use and the development of fibromuscular dysplasia, it
could not be implicated in the mode of presentation.

Inhibition of tributyltin mediated hemolysis by mercapto compounds.

Gray BH, Porvaznik M, Lee LH, Flemming C.

Hydrophobic tributyltin (TBT) compounds at concentrations greater than 10 microM 
caused hemolysis of human erythrocytes and formed structures in plasma membranes.
The mercapto compounds, beta-mercaptoethanol (beta MER), 2,3-dimercaptopropanol
(BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propane sulfonate (DMPS), DL-dithiothreitol (DTT), and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were examined for their ability to
inhibit TBT mediated hemolysis. The relative order of effectiveness for
inhibition of TBT mediated hemolysis was BAL greater than DTT greater than DMSA
greater than DMPS greater than beta MER. A four-fold excess of BAL over TBT
prevented hemolysis for 4 hrs and addition of BAL 0.5 hr after TBT reduced the
rate of hemolysis. The number of membrane associated TBT aggregates observed per 
cell profile decreased as the BAL concentration increased from 0 to 100 microM.
However, the mean diameter of TBT aggregates nearly doubled in erythrocyte
suspensions at 100 microM BAL. Reactions of dimercapto compounds with lipophilic 
TBT aggregates may depend on their relative lipid solubilities. Also, conversion 
of the weak Lewis acid, TBT, from a four to a five or six-coordinate tin adduct
by the dimercapto Lewis bases used could also be a factor slowing hemolysis
rates.

99mTechnetium(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc(v) DMSA) as a tumour seeking
agent in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Aw SE, Sundram FX, Goh AS.

We prepared 99mTechnetium(V) DMSA (pentavalent form) as an imaging agent for
eighteen patients with proven nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The head, neck, chest and
abdomen were scanned. The nasopharyngeal tumour showed tracer accumulation in
only 5 out of the 18 patients (28%). The study indicates that 99mTechnetium(V)
DMSA is not a useful radiopharmaceutical for visualising nasopharyngeal tumours
although it may have other useful properties.

Acute aluminium intoxication: a study of the efficacy of several antidotal
treatments in mice.

Domingo JL, Llobet JM, Gómez M, Corbella J.

The effect of the chelating agents deferoxamine mesylate (DFOA), sodium
salicylate, citric acid, Na2Ca-ethylendiaminetetracetate (EDTA), nitrilotriacetic
acid (NTA), L-cysteine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and 2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) on the lethality, elimination and tissue retention of aluminum was
investigated on male Swiss mice. To determine the effect of the various chelators
on the lethality of aluminium, various doses of Al (NO3)3.9H2O (3.0 - 7.5
mmol/kg) were given intraperitoneally followed immediately by the ip
administration of the chelator (at dose equal to one-third of their respective
LD50). Survival was recorded at the end of 14 days. Significant increases in
survival were noted with citric acid and DFOA. A decrease of the aluminium
concentration in various tissues, and an increase in urinary and fecal
elimination of aluminium were also noted with citric acid, DFOA, and sodium
salicylate. Citric acid appear to be the most effective agent of those tested in 
the prevention of acute aluminum intoxication.

Formation of labelled colloid in 99Tcm-DMSA due to the presence of bactericidal
fluid.

Murray T, Hilditch TE, Whateley TL, Elliott AT.

The possibility that traces of bactericidal fluid in 99Tcm-DMSA could lead to the
formation of labelled colloid, was explored. In vitro investigations were
undertaken using ultracentrifugation techniques and photon correlation
spectroscopy. The latter showed that both contaminated and uncontaminated DMSA
contained colloidal (or particulate) material. However the presence of 10
microliters bactericidal fluid as contaminant was shown by ultracentrifugation to
result in labelling of this colloidal material when 99Tcm was added to DMSA.
Studies in a normal volunteer confirmed the results of the in vitro studies, in
that significant liver and spleen uptake was observed after the administration of
contaminated 99Tcm-DMSA.

Potential pitfall of DMSA scintigraphy in patients with ureteral duplication.

Wu F, Snow B, Taylor A Jr.

A 5-wk-old male presented with radiographic findings of a duplicated collecting
system. A [99mTc]DMSA scan was requested to evaluate cortical function. Images
obtained immediately. postinjection showed activity restricted to the upper
poles; in contrast, delayed images at 4 hr showed activity in the bladder and
throughout both kidneys. Catheterizing the patient drained the activity from the 
bladder but had little effect on the refluxed renal activity. The early
[99mTc]DMSA images were critical in making the proper interpretation.
Technetium-99m DMSA is excreted into the urine and this fact needs to be
considered when interpreting scans of patients with possible reflux or
obstruction. When DMSA scans are obtained in pediatric patients with possible
reflux, catheterization prior to the study and early images prior to the
appearance of DMSA in the collecting system are recommended.

Indium-111-labeled leukocyte scanning is a highly sensitive and specific method
of detecting abscesses. This report describes a patient with polycystic kidneys
and a single infected cyst. Ultrasound could not determine which cyst was
infected, but the infected cyst could be localized by [111In]leukocyte imaging in
conjunction with a [99mTc]DMSA renal scan. The two radionuclide studies were used
to identify an infected renal cyst and direct ultrasound guided aspiration.

Although several authors have claimed that the function of an obstructed kidney
could be overestimated on Tc-99m DMSA imaging, the clinical importance of such an
overestimation has not been well documented. Partial obstruction of one ureter
was created in a rat, and a relative Tc-99m DMSA uptake was obtained 4 hours
after intravenous injection. By puncture of the isolated obstructed kidney, it
was shown that the function of that kidney was overestimated by at least 17%.

Cytotoxicity of metals, metal-metal and metal-chelator combinations assayed in
vitro.

Borenfreund E, Puerner JA.

A simple, rapid assay, based on the lysosomal incorporation of neutral red by
cells, conveniently carried out in 96-well microtiter plates, was used to
evaluate the cytotoxic effect of cationic and anionic metal salts on BALB/c mouse
3T3 fibroblasts. Ranking of the metals according to their decreasing potency was 
based on spectrophotometrically determined absorbance of the neutral red,
extracted from surviving viable cells. The rank order was Cd greater than Hg
greater than Ag greater than Zn greater than Mn greater than Cu greater than Co
greater than Ni greater than Cr(III) for the cationic metals and Cr2O7 greater
than CrO4 greater than AsO2 greater than AsO4 greater than SeO3 greater than SeO4
greater than MnO4 for the anionic metals tested. Cationic metals incubated with
cultures in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were 3-4 times more
toxic than in medium with 10% FBS. Cadmium served as a representative metal for
the use of this assay not only for concentration, but also for time dependent
exposures. Thus a 10% cytotoxic effect after 1 h of incubation with 60 microM
cadmium was increased to 90% after 6 h. Examination of the effect of metal-metal 
interaction on cytotoxicity showed a marked reduction of cadmium toxicity by zinc
and to a lesser degree, by nickel. The neutral red assay was also effectively
used to investigate the effect of the chelators ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on
cadmium-induced injury. Cytotoxicity by cadmium was completely inhibited by EDTA,
and partially by NTA, but DMSA was ineffective. Reduction of copper toxicity by
chelation was less efficient than for cadmium. Use of a chelator as therapy
against metal poisoning was only partially effective and limited to
administration within 2 h after incubation of cells with cadmium. It is believed 
that the neutral red assay can be a valuable tool for the screening of cytotoxic 
and potentially therapeutic agents under controlled in vitro conditions.

Visual determination of differential renal function.

Kipper MS, Witztum KF, Taylor A Jr.

Forty patients (43 studies) referred for determination of differential renal
function were imaged 24 hours after intravenous administration of Tc-99m-2, 3
DMSA. Visual assessment of relative renal uptake was estimated independently by
three observers at three different hospitals from analog images on standard x-ray
film. The results were compared with the relative DMSA uptake obtained by summing
counts in computer-assisted regions of interest placed over each kidney. There
was excellent correlation between the visual estimates of each observer and the
computer-generated values (r = 0.98, 0.96, and 0.98, respectively). If a computer
is not available, good visual estimates of differential uptake still may be
obtained when static imaging agents such as DMSA are administered.

Comparison of the effectiveness of several chelators after single administration

Llobet JM, Domingo JL, Corbella J.

The effects of the chelating agents Na2Ca-ethylendiaminetetraacetate (EDTA),
Na3Ca-diethylentriaminepentaacetate (DTPA), L-cysteine, 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), glutathione, D,L-penicillamine (D,L-PEN) 
and 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BAL) on the toxicity, distribution and excretion of
intraperitoneally injected cobalt were studied in male Swiss mice. To determine
the effect of the various chelators on the toxicity of cobalt, various doses of
CoCl2 (0.60-1.80 mmol/kg) were given, followed immediately by the IP
administration of the chelator (at a dose equal to one-fourth of their respective
LD50). EDTA and DTPA were the most effective. EDTA, DTPA and L-cysteine, NAC and 
glutathione were also the most effective in increasing the urinary excretion of
cobalt and reducing the concentration of the metal in various tissues. EDTA
appears to be the most effective agent of those tested in the prevention of acute
cobalt intoxication.

Effects of diethyldithiocarbamate and selected analogs on lead metabolism in
mice.

Gale GR, Atkins LM, Smith AB, Jones MM.

Diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) and certain of its N,N-disubstituted analogs were
evaluated for effectiveness in reducing organ concentrations and whole body
burdens of lead (Pb) in mice which had received 0.06 mg of Pb(II) acetate along
with 2.0 microCi of 210Pb 9 days earlier. CaNa2EDTA was used as a positive
control for studies in which the compounds were administered ip, and
meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was used as a positive control for po
studies. DDTC was more effective than EDTA in lowering the whole body Pb burdens 
after 5 ip injections, while N-methyl-N-dithiocarboxyglucamine (MDCG) was less
active than EDTA. The other 4 analogs tested were inactive. When DDTC (1.5
mmoles/kg) was coadministered with EDTA (1.5 mmoles/kg), the reduction of total
body Pb burdens was significantly greater than that attained with either compound
alone at 3.0 mmoles/kg. DDTC was particularly effective in reducing hepatic and
splenic Pb concentrations, but was less active than EDTA in lowering the Pb
content of bone, kidneys, and brain. Excretion of Pb following ip treatment with 
EDTA, DDTC, or MDCG was predominantly by the fecal route. DDTC was significantly 
more effective than DMSA at an equimolar dose in reducing whole body Pb burdens
when each was given po. However, po administration of DDTC caused a substantial
increase in brain Pb levels.

Disposition of [14C]dimercaptosuccinic acid in mice.

Liang YY, Marlowe C, Waddell WJ.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid labeled with 14C ([14C]DMSA) was administered to mice iv;
the mice were frozen by immersion in dry ice/hexane at 6 and 20 min and 1, 3, 9, 
and 24 hr after injection. The frozen mice were sectioned and processed for
whole-body autoradiography for soluble substances. The radioactivity was highly
localized in extracellular fluids such as the subcutaneous, intrapleural,
intraperitoneal, and periosteal spaces. There was a pronounced accumulation in
the periosteal fluid above that in other fluids during the first hour after
injection. Most of the radioactivity was eliminated by the kidney and liver.
Pretreatment of a mouse with HgCl2 subcutaneously 1 hr before [14C]DMSA produced 
an increase in radioactivity in the liver and decrease in lung. A high
concentration of radioactivity was seen at the subcutaneous site of injection of 
the HgCl2. The results are interpreted to indicate that most of the DMSA is in
the extracellular space but that it can cross cellular membranes to some extent. 
The pronounced accumulation in periosteal fluid may be an interaction of DMSA
with Ca2+ in this space. No tissue had a pronounced retention of the compound,
but lung retained more than most other tissues.

[Estimation of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal uptake using single photon
emission computed tomography].

[Article in Japanese]

Ohishi Y, Machida T, Kido A, Tashiro K, Wada T, Torii S, Yoshigoe F, Yamada H,
Chiba K, Toyama H.

Renal function was assessed by measurement of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) uptake by the kidney based on the transsectional tomographic image
obtained by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The renal uptake 
was expressed as percentage of the total radioactivity detected in the kidney,
the volume of which was measured by convolution method, against the amount dosed.
Absorption was corrected by GE-STAR method using cut off level of 42%. In order
to determine normal range, measurement was made for 40 kidneys of each of 10 male
and female volunteers confirmed of having normal kidneys both morphologically and
functionally. The average volume of the kidney was 220.4 ml for the right and
239.3 ml for the left for males, and 205.9 ml and 236.5 ml, respectively for
females. The renal uptake of radioactivity (at 2 h after injection), was 26.8%
for the right and 27.6% for the left for males, with corresponding figures for
females being 26.4% and 27.9%, respectively. Distribution range of renal volume
and renal uptake was obtained by bivariate analysis with 90% and 95% probability.
From these results, our method of renal function determination based on renal
uptake of 99mTc-DMSA obtained from renal transactional tomogram by SPECT is
considered to be accurate and potentially useful for clinical purpose.

Failure to visualize acutely injured kidneys with technetium-99m DMSA does not
preclude recoverable function.

Taylor A Jr, Akiya F, Gregory MC.

A 35-yr-old patient developed severe acute tubular necrosis requiring
hemodialysis. A [99mTc]dimercaptosuccinic acid scan of the kidneys showed no
renal uptake at 4 or 24 hr, but the patient subsequently recovered normal renal
function as judged by a normal serum creatinine. Based on this case report and a 
review of the literature, one cannot assume irreversible loss of function in
patients with acute renal failure, based on the absence of radiopharmaceutical
uptake by the kidneys.

Comparative antidotal effects of diethyldithiocarbamate, dimercaptosuccinate, and
diethylenetriaminepentaacetate against cadmium-induced testicular toxicity in
mice.

Walker EM Jr, Gale GR, Fody EP, Atkins LM, Smith AB, Jones MM.

The compounds diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC, Dithiocarb), 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA), and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) were evaluated for
effectiveness in protecting mouse testes following administration of an LD100
dose of CdCl2 X 2.5 H2O (Cd). Toxicologic responses were assessed by light
microscopic techniques. DTPA gave the most effective testicular protection of the
three compounds when given within 30 minutes prior to Cd, but only DDTC was
effective when given 30 minutes or longer after Cd. Degenerative changes were
minimal when DDTC was given as late as three hours after Cd, and were mild
following a four-hour interval. However, the changes were marked, but less severe
than in mice receiving Cd only, when DDTC was administered five hours after Cd.

[Radioisotopic quantification of kidney function using Tc-99m-DMSA. Comparison
with creatinine clearance in children with a single kidney].

[Article in French]

Baillet G, Gagnadoux MF, Mathonnat F, de Vernejoul P, Broyer M.

To assess the accuracy of renal function quantification with Tc 99m-DMSA in
children, we compared DMSA renal uptake and creatinine clearance in 16 cases of
children with single kidney. The age of the patients ranged from two month to
fourteen years. DMSA renal uptake was measured 7 hours after injection and was
normalized in percent of the injected activity. A significant correlation was
found between creatinine clearance and DMSA uptake (Pearson's r = 0.866, p less
than 0.01). Normal creatinine clearance in children (80 to 120 ml/min-1 X 1.73
m-2) allowed determination of normal renal uptake (36 to 60%). This study
indicates that in cases of asymmetrical renal impairment renal uptake reflects
split renal creatinine clearance. Since the former is much easier to measure,
DMSA should play an important role in the evaluation of differential renal
function.

99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-DMSA renal gamma imaging in the surveillance of patients
with conduit urinary diversion.

Lindell O, Kivisaari A, Lehtonen T.

We studied renal anatomy and function using 99mTc-2-3 dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) and 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) in 27 patients with
conduit urinary diversion. In this condition, free ureteral reflux is often
associated with bacteriuria, and these factors are thought to precipitate
progressive renal deterioration. Gamma-camera images provided valuable
information concerning the structure of the renal parenchyma, the function of
individual kidneys and possible ureteral obstruction, thus helping us to decide
whether or not to instigate further treatment. The information gained using renal
gamma imaging with 99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-DMSA was complementary and partly
overlapping. We preferred the use of 99mTc-DTPA because of its ability to
visualise the ureters and the region of ureteroconduit anastomosis. Using
diuretic medication, we were able to differentiate true ureteral obstruction from
atony in 9 patients using 99mTc-DTPA.

Arsenic excretion after treatment of arsenic poisoning with DMSA or DMPS in mice.

Maehashi H, Murata Y.

The effects of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and
2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonic acid, Na salt (DMPS) on arsenic excretion in
arsenic poisoning were studied using ICR mice. One group of mice was given
arsenic trioxide (5 mg As/kg, s.c.) and another two groups were given DMSA or
DMPS (100 mg/kg, i.p.) immediately after administration of the arsenic (5 mg/kg, 
s.c.). Arsenic excretion in urine and feces was determined by atomic absorption
spectrophotometry. Results obtained showed a marked arsenic excretion in the
urine collected at the first 12 hr in the group treated with DMSA. Further
remarkable arsenic excretion in the feces was seen in the group treated with
DMPS, suggesting that arsenic might have been excreted in the bile.

Calculation of relative glomerular filtration rate and correlation with delayed
technetium-99m DMSA imaging.

Taylor A Jr, Kipper M, Witztum K.

The relative renal uptake of Tc-99m DMSA was compared with the relative
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in ten patients with serum creatinines ranging
from 0.3 to 2.5 mg/dl. Relative GFR was based on the renal uptake of Tc-99m DTPA 
determined by two methods: 1) integrating the counts from 1 to 3 minutes
postinjection and correcting for background. 2) Totalizing the individual renal
counts in a single 15-second frame from 2:45 minutes to 3:00 minutes
postinjection and correcting for background. The two methods of determining
relative DTPA uptake showed excellent correlation, r = 0.98. Relative DMSA uptake
determined at 24 hours post-injection using computer-assisted regions of interest
showed excellent correlation with the relative GFR determined by either the
integral or single-frame method, r = 0.98. The addition of background subtraction
for the DMSA images at 24 hours did not improve the correlation.

Assessment of split renal function with 99mTc-aprotinin.

Aprile C, Saponaro R, Villa G, Carena M, Lunghi F, Solerte SB, Salvadeo A.

The aim of this work is to correlate the net kidney uptake of 99mTc-aprotinin
(TcA) in 103 subjects with separate effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and some
blood chemistry parameters at 90, 180, and 360 min postinjection both in the
normal and diseased kidney. Correlations found with separate ERPFs are highly
significant at any time (P less than 0.001). However, although the slope of the
regression line is steeper at 180 min, r tends to deteriorate slightly with time 
postinjection and a higher intercept on the y axis; this pattern is more
pronounced if diseased kidneys are considered separately. The following are
probably related to the renal handling of TcA: Early scans better reflect blood
flow to the kidney, while later scans are more related to the
metabolism/excretion tubular mechanisms; correlations found with urea,
creatinine, urea clearance, and creatinine clearance are highly significant at
any time; in 20 additional patients with diseased kidneys, renal uptake
measurements done 360 min postinjection first with TcA and then with DMSA showed 
better correlations with ERPF employing TcA. Our results indicate that TcA is a
feasible indicator of split renal function even at 90 min postinjection when a
scan is easily carried out on an outpatient basis.

Imaging of head and neck tumors with technetium(V)-99m DMSA. A new tumor-seeking 
agent.

Ohta H, Endo K, Fujita T, Nakashima T, Sakahara H, Torizuka K, Shimizu Y, Ishii
Y, Makimoto K, Hata N, et al.

Tumor scintigraphy, using Tc(V)-99m DMSA was performed on 76 patients with head
and neck tumors. In 32 cases, SPECT also was performed. Tc(V)-99m DMSA was found 
to have a sensitivity of 75% (56 cases), a specificity of 85% (20 cases) and an
accuracy of 78% on planar imaging. ECT studies showed accumulation of Tc(V)-99m
DMSA in all 25 malignant cases studied. However, in benign tumors, four of seven 
cases (57%) showed radionuclide uptake. Tc(V)-99m DMSA has superior physical
properties to Ga-67 and could be of use in the diagnosis of head and neck tumors.

Renal accumulation of 99mTc-DMSA in the artificially perfused isolated rat
kidney.

Goldraich NP, Alvarenga AR, Goldraich IH, Ramos OL, Sigulem D.

In order to investigate aspects of the renal handling of 99mTc-DMSA, 68 isolated 
rat kidneys were artificially perfused. The experimental groups were: Group 1
(no. = 32)-oxygenated filtering kidneys; Group 2 (no. = 29)-oxygenated
non-filtering kidneys; Group 3 (no. = 7)-anaerobic non-filtering kidneys. We
conclude that the 99mTc-DMSA complex is strongly bound to albumin, is not
filtered and is removed from perfusion fluid through the renal peritubular
capillary route and that this occurs by an active process which depends upon
aerobic metabolism. This process has a high capacity and is not inhibited by
probenecid.

Comparison of antidotal efficacy of chelating agents upon acute toxicity of
Co(II) in mice.

Llobet JM, Domingo JL, Corbella J.

The relative efficacy of 14 chelating agents in alleviating acute cobalt (II)
chloride (ip) intoxication has been determined. For a level of 0.70 mmol/kg ip of
CoCl2 (slightly higher than its LD50), the ip administration of chelating agents 
at a 2:1 and 5:1 mole ratio resulted in a significant antidotal action for
L-cysteine, N-acetyl-cysteine, L-histidine,glutathione,D,L-penicillamine, DMSA,
DTPA and EDTA. For a level of 1.18 mmol/kg ip of CoCl2 (slightly higher than its 
LD99) only L-cysteine, N-acetylcysteine,glutathione, DMSA, DTPA and EDTA resulted
in a significant enhancement of the survival rate. The therapeutic indices of
these compounds were respectively: 8.3, 11.8, 10.9, 9.1, 20.5 and 26.4; with EDTA
and DTPA being the most effective. However, due to their low toxicity,
N-acetylcysteine and glutathione should be considered as possible alternatives.

[Percutaneous nephrostomy--the method and technical problems].

[Article in Japanese]

Higashi Y, Oishi K, Hida S, Nishimura M, Kihara Y, Takenawa J, Tanaka H, Kawamura
J, Yoshida O.

Ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrostomy (PNS) was performed on 72 patients (80
kidneys) including pretreatment for percutaneous nephro-uretero lithotomy (PNL). 
PNS was performed for post-renal anuria or hydronephrosis in 23 cases (28
kidneys), for urinary leakage in 4 cases (5 kidneys), for vesical bleeding in 1
case (2 kidneys) and as pretreatment of PNL in 44 cases (45 kidneys). Ultrasound 
guided renal puncture was done percutaneously and a 0.038 inch J-tipped wire
guide was inserted into the suitable calyx. Then the nephrostomy tract was
dilated with fascia dilators of Malecot nephrostomy set. A 14 Fr or 16 Fr Malecot
catheter was used for hydronephrosis or urinary leakage cases. 18 Fr, 24 Fr
Malecot catheter or Bardex balloon catheter 18-22 Fr was inserted for PNL cases. 
In the PNL group, Ht decreased slightly but there was no need of blood
transfusion. In the other groups, Ht did not change. Defect of 99m-Tc-DMSA renal 
uptake in several cases suggested renal injury at nephrostomied cortex. In about 
70% of the cases, a fever of more than 37 degrees C was observed, and in 4 cases,
more than 39 degrees C was observed. There were no major complications observed. 
In conclusion, percutaneous nephrostomy using Malecot nephrostomy set is a safe
and effective method.

Quantitation of renal function with 99Tcm-DMSA. A comparison with creatinine
clearance in children with single kidney.

Baillet G, Gagnadoux MF, De Vernejoul P, Broyer M.

To study the accuracy of renal function quantification with 99Tcm-DMSA we
compared DMSA renal uptake and creatinine clearance in 16 cases of children with 
single kidney. The age of the patients ranged from two months to fourteen years. 
Creatinine clearance was normalized to 1.73 m2. DMSA uptake was measured 7 h
after intravenous injection. Background subtraction was used and soft tissue
attenuation was taken into account. The uptake was normalized in percentage of
the injected activity. A significant correlation was found between creatinine
clearance and DMSA uptake (rt = 0.866, p less than 0.01). Normal creatinine
clearance range in children (80 to 120 ml min-1/1.73 m2) allowed determination of
normal uptake range (36 to 60%). This study indicates that in case of
asymmetrical renal impairment renal uptake will reflect split renal creatinine
clearance. Since the former is much easier to measure, DMSA should play an
important role in the evaluation of differential renal function.

Mechanism of renal concentration of technetium-99m glucoheptonate.

Lee HB, Blaufox MD.

Seventy female Sprague-Dawley rats were studied to determine the mechanism of
tubular localization and the effects of commonly encountered changes in hydration
and acid-base balance on renal uptake and urinary excretion of technetium-99m
glucoheptonate ([99mTc]GHA). The in-vivo protein binding and protein-free plasma 
clearance of [99mTc]GHA also were quantitated. Twenty additional rats were
studied to determine the effects of PAH competition and probenecid blockade on
renal uptake of [99mTc]dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in comparison with their
effects on [99mTc]GHA localization. Kidney uptake of [99mTc]GHA averaged 11.17
+/- 0.49 (s.e.)% of the injected dose in control animals. This varied slightly
among groups but was significantly reduced by probenecid blockade and
para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) competition to 4.08 +/- 0.55 (p less than 0.005)
and 2.39 +/- 0.14 (p less than 0.005), respectively. Technetium-99m DMSA was not 
affected in its renal accumulation by these maneuvers. The total plasma clearance
of [99mTc]GHA was lower than iodine-125(125I)iothalamate but the clearance of the
protein free supernate was higher, raising a possibility of some tubular
secretion. Acidification of the urine which has been shown to reduce [99mTc]DMSA 
uptake appeared to have no effect on [99mTc]GHA. Hepatic uptake was minimal in
all groups averaging less than 1% injected dose. These data demonstrate that
renal accumulation of [99mTc]GHA is blocked by probenecid and PAH suggesting that
it is actively concentrated in the proximal tubule by enzyme systems similar to
those involved in PAH and hippuran transport. It appears that [99mTc]GHA uptake
measures a different aspect of kidney function than [99mTc]DMSA.

Combined [99mTc]DMSA kidney scintigraphy and [131I]hippuran renography in
children with urinary tract infections.

Thelle T, Biskjaer N.

Combined [99mTc]DMSA kidney scintigraphy and [131I]hippuran renography were
performed consecutively in 87 children with recurrent urinary tract infections in
a retrospective study. This procedure allows a description of renal cortical
morphology, split function determination and run-off evaluation. Signs of
cortical scarring were found in 41 of 172 kidneys (24%) and were significantly
associated with vesico-ureteral reflux (p less than 0.001) and with delayed
urinary run-off (p less than 0.01). Split renal function was significantly
reduced in kidneys with unilateral scarring (p less than 0.001). The
radio-isotope investigations and intravenous urography were performed within 3
months of each other in 56 patients (110 kidneys). Good agreement between the
findings was found except for 13 kidneys, where cortical activity defects were
revealed by scintiscan despite normal urography. The extended scintigraphic
procedure described is considered useful for urological screening of children
with urinary tract infections and may thus replace urography as a first-line
investigation. It should be followed by micturition cysto-urethrography when
evaluation for vesico-ureteral reflux is indicated.

Renal handling of technetium-99m DMSA in rats with proximal tubular dysfunction.

Provoost AP, Van Aken M.

The renal handling of technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid ([99mTc]DMSA) was
studied in rats before and after treatment with Na-maleate (2 mmol/kg i.v.). In
the control period, when measured 2 hr after the intravenous injection of
[99mTc]DMSA, 39.9% of the injected dose was in the kidneys and 14.6% was in the
bladder. After Na-maleate treatment, only 6.4% of the injected dose of
[99mTc]DMSA was retained in the kidneys while 37.9% was found in the bladder.
Subsequent studies revealed that Na-maleate produced a fall in the glomerular
filtration rate, the effective renal plasma flow, and a generalized proximal
tubular dysfunction. The latter was characterized by polyuria and an increased
excretion of glucose, protein, albumin, calcium, and inorganic phosphate. It was 
concluded that proximal tubular dysfunction markedly alters the renal handling of
[99mTc]DMSA. Whether this augmented urinary excretion is due to an inhibition of 
reabsorption or an enhanced cellular efflux of [99mTc]DMSA remains to be
answered.

Unilateral ureteric reimplantation for primary vesicoureteric reflux in children.
A policy re-evaluated.

Quinlan D, O'Donnell B.

Fifty-one children had unilateral ureteric reimplants for primary vesicoureteric 
reflux over an 11-year period. Reflux was abolished in 50 patients but in 8
(15.7%) it developed or became worse on the contralateral side. An isotope renal 
scan (99mTc DMSA) was carried out in 15 of the 18 patients who had grossly
scarred or dysplastic kidneys. Thirteen of these had less than 22% of total
function coming from the affected kidney and seven had less than 10% of their
total GFR coming from the kidney whose ureter had previously been reimplanted.
Five of these children have undergone nephrectomy and it is felt that this would 
have been a better initial procedure. No patient was hypertensive at the
conclusion of the study.

Protection of mice against the lethal effects of sodium metavanadate: a

Domingo JL, Llobet JM, Corbella J.

10 Chelating agents were administered to mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
in order to compare their relative effectiveness in preventing death after a
single i.p. injection of NaVO3. Ascorbic acid, Tiron
(4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene-disulfonic acid) and deferoxamine were the most
effective antidotes for acute NaVO3-toxicity. The therapeutic index of ascorbic
acid against 0.61 mmol/kg NaVO3 was found to be 95.2. This was 4.6 and 12.2 times
greater than those of Tiron and Deferoxamine respectively. L-Cysteine greater
than Na2CaEDTA greater than Na3CaDTPA reduced the acute mortality of mice
following i.p. injection of NaVO3. Sodium salicylate, D,L-penicillamine, DMSA and
DDC were not effective as antidotes for acute NaVO3-toxicity.

[Renal function study by 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy in each treatment of
staghorn calculi].

[Article in Japanese]

Hida S, Kawamura J, Yoshida O.

From 1976 through 1984, 94 staghorn calculi of 86 patients were treated in this
department. Kidney function was assessed by Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy consisting
of renal cortical imaging and DMSA renal uptake rate, in 84 kidneys
preoperatively and 43 kidneys pre- and postoperatively. There was an increase in 
the postoperative DMSA renal uptake in the operated kidney, in 3 out of 14
kidneys in which pyelolithotomy was performed and in one out of 10 kidneys in
which nephrolithotomy was done. It was still impossible to answer the question of
which mode of operation should be chosen only from consideration of kidney
function study. But it was suggested by the statistical investigation that
nephrectomy seemed to be selected in the case of severely decreased renal
function. It was reasonable that pyelolithotomy was the best method from the
point of predicting the postoperative recovery of renal function. But in the near
future, advances in endoscopical stone surgery and extracorporeal procedures,
might reduce the damage of the renal function caused by conventional stone
surgery.

Ultrasound-guided renal cyst puncture was performed on 31 cysts which were then
95% ethanol instilled to prevent recurrence of cystic fluid. Ethanol was allowed 
to remain in place for 20 minutes and removed through the catheter. Morphological
improvement was observed on IVP and Tc-99m-DMSA renal scintigram, and DMSA renal 
uptake rate increased slightly. The cystic wall became thicker, and cystic fluid 
did not remain any more. The renal tissue near the cyst was intact. One third of 
the patients had hotflush and/or somewhat drunken sense but these symptoms were
only temporary. This method of therapy is a safe and effective way of treating
renal cysts.

The relationship between renal parenchymal mass and absolute quantitation of
99Tcm-DMSA uptake. An experimental study in the growing pig.

Godley ML, Ransley PG, Gordon I, Risdon RA, Vivian G, Todd-Pokropek A.

Five Gottingen minipigs from the same litter aged 1 month entered the study and
right nephrectomies were performed at staggered intervals between weeks 1 and 5. 
Absolute renal uptake of 99Tcm-DMSA, expressed as a percentage of the
administered dose, was recorded in each animal weekly before right nephrectomy
and at weekly intervals for 5 weeks post-nephrectomy. Before nephrectomy absolute
renal uptake of 99Tcm-DMSA ranged between 16.8 and 21.5% (mean 18.6%) per kidney 
with no difference between right and left kidneys. After right nephrectomy,
uptake in the left kidney approximately doubled within 1 week. No correlation was
shown between renal parenchymal mass and absolute 99Tcm-DMSA uptake in paired or 
solitary normal kidneys undergoing growth or compensatory growth.

[The use of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renoscintigraphy in the evaluation of
differential renal function].

[Article in Japanese]

Okamura K, Ito K, Senda M, Ban K, Takeuchi F, Shimoji T.

We studied the total and differential renal function by 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic 
acid (DMSA) renoscintigraphy and present a formula to estimate the renal depth
for the Japanese and the attenuation coefficient which influenced renal uptake.
Total renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA correlated well with creatinine clearance and
with the PSP test, and there was a close correlation between its relative uptake 
and relative function as determined by 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid
(DTPA) renography. Therefore differential renal function test with 99mTc-DMSA

99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy provided useful morphological information.

A convenient method for the preparation of 99mTc(V)dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc(V)-DMSA).

Westera G, Gadze A, Horst W.

Tc(IV)-DMSA for kidney scintigraphy has been prepared in acidic solution. Once
the labeling is done in basic solution, upon addition of a small amount of
NaHCO3, a mixture of 3-4 other DMSA-complexes is formed, presumably containing
Tc(V). Kidney uptake in male adult rats of the 99mTc(V)-DMSA is 1.6% injected
dose/g (4.9%/total organ) compared to 16.4% injected dose/g (resp. 50.3%/total
organ) for 99mTc(IV)-DMSA.

Van Poppel H, Vereecken R, Vekemans K, Verduyn H, Mortelmans L, de Roo M.

Two hundred-two 99mTc-DMSA renograms for urologic problems were evaluated. Some
technical aspects of the examination and the value of the scintigraphic depth
estimation are discussed. Pre- and postoperative uptake values in patients with

of DMSA renograms in predicting recovery in obstructive uropathy and in deciding 
to opt for conservative therapy or nephrectomy is discussed.

2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid as an antidote for lead intoxication.

Graziano JH, Siris ES, LoIacono N, Silverberg SJ, Turgeon L.

2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is an orally effective drug more specific and 
with a wider therapeutic index than currently available drugs for lead
intoxication. Eighteen men with elevated blood lead (BPb) concentrations received
either 30, 20, or 10 mg/kg DMSA for 5 days in three divided daily doses. The mean
BPb level decreased 72.5%, 58.3%, and 35.5% of the pretreatment values, with a
simultaneous elevation in urinary Pb excretion. Clinical symptoms and biochemical
indices of lead toxicity also improved. Red blood cell d-aminolevulinic acid
dehydratase activity increased, while urinary excretion of d-aminolevulinic acid 
and coproporphyrin fell. DMSA was well tolerated; the only observed adverse drug 
reaction was a mild, transient elevation of serum SGPT levels in two subjects.
DMSA appears promising and may greatly simplify the treatment of lead
intoxication.

A comparison of the tumor-seeking agent Tc-99m(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid and the
renal imaging agent Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid in humans.

Ohta H, Ishii M, Yoshizumi M, Endo K, Sakahara H, Nakajima T, Yomoda I, Masuda H,
Horiuchi K, Hata N, et al.

Being aware of the ideal nuclear properties of Tc-99m, our interest has been
focused on the design of the (+5) oxidation state Tc-99m(V) dimercaptosuccinic
acid (Tc(V)-DMSA) as a tumor-seeking agent. Tc-99m(V) DMSA holds a TcO4(3-) core 
and, like PO4(3-), has excellent characteristics for tumor uptake, but has a
different distribution than the well-known renal scanning agent, Tc-99m DMSA. The
differences in chemical behavior of Tc-99m(V) DMSA and Tc-99m DMSA are discussed.
Three cases in which neoplasms were studies with Tc-99m(V) DMSA and Tc-99m DMSA
are presented. Tc-99m DMSA and Tc-99m(V) DMSA, having a common ligand and tracer 
but, with the metal ion core in a different oxidation state, the uptake
characteristics are altered markedly.

The management of vesicoureteric reflux.

Bellinger MF.

An increasingly large volume of data is being accumulated regarding the effects
of vesicoureteric reflux on the kidney, data that influence clinical management. 
Although concrete guidelines cannot be drawn that will apply to all patients,
important considerations include the following: All children with documented
urinary infections should have a voiding cystourethrogram. The voiding
cystourethrogram may correlate with probability of spontaneous resolution of
vesicoureteric reflux. Younger patients have a higher chance of spontaneous
resolution of vesicoureteric reflux. There is a definite familial tendency to
vesicoureteric reflux, and patients with significant vesicoureteric reflux and
scarring are more likely to have affected siblings. DMSA renal scanning is highly
sensitive in the detection of scarring. Cystoscopy may play a role in the
evaluation of the refluxing ureterovesical junction, but does not have as much
prognostic significance as the voiding cystourethrogram. Urodynamic investigation
may be important in evaluating children with urinary infections, reflux, and
symptoms of voiding dysfunction. High-grade vesicoureteric reflux is associated
with an increased incidence of renal scarring, and the answer to optimal
management is not yet available. Most scarring occurs in infancy or childhood.
Nonoperative management, especially in moderate degrees of reflux, can achieve a 
high rate of success. Nonoperative management requires continuous antibiotic
prophylaxis. Breakthrough infections or lack of compliance with nonsurgical
management have a high complication rate and must be managed aggressively.
Antireflux surgery can be performed with a minimal complication rate.(ABSTRACT

Hypertension in children. Increased efficacy of technetium Tc 99m succimer in
screening for renal disease.

Rosen PR, Treves S, Ingelfinger J.

Renal scintigraphy with technetium Tc 99m succimer (DMSA) and technetium Tc 99m
pentetate (DTPA) was used to study 80 hypertensive pediatric and adolescent
patients. Renal abnormalities such as asymmetry of function, size, or shape were 
identified in 13 patients. Both excretory urography and technetium Tc 99m
pentetate studies were successful in detecting 54% of the abnormalities in
patients studied; technetium Tc 99m succimer identified 92%. The accuracy of the 
latter was 96%, with a specificity of 97%. The ability of technetium Tc 99m
succimer renal scintigraphy to identify accurately the presence or absence of
renal abnormalities warrants its inclusion in the initial examination of
pediatric and adolescent patients with hypertension.

Dimercaptan metal-binding agents influence the biotransformation of arsenite in
the rabbit.

Maiorino RM, Aposhian HV.

The urinary metabolites of sodium arsenite have been investigated in rabbits
given sodium arsenite and water-soluble dimercaptans. Rabbits injected sc with
NaAsO2 (1 mg As/kg) were given, im 1 hr later, either saline,
2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), mesodimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA),
or N-(2,3-dimercaptopropyl)phthalamidic acid (DMPA) at 0.2 mmol/kg. Arsenic
metabolites in urine collected from treated rabbits were isolated by combined
anion-cation-exchange chromatography. Column fractions were acid-digested and
analyzed for arsenic by direct hydride-flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
The relative amounts of inorganic arsenic, methylarsonate, and dimethylarsinate
found in 0 to 24 hr urine of rabbits given only sodium arsenite agreed closely
with those reported for human subjects given arsenite po. This finding suggests
that the rabbit biotransforms arsenite in a manner very similar to that of man.
The urinary excretion of total arsenic between 0 and 24 hr was elevated after
dimercaptan administration, but urinary excretion of total arsenic between 0 and 
48 hr was unaffected. This result indicates that the action of these dimercaptans
occurs early after treatment. In addition, the dimercaptans influenced
differently the amounts of the arsenic metabolites excreted in the urine between 
0 and 24 hr. DMPS, DMSA, or DMPA increased arsenite excretion but decreased
dimethylarsinate excretion. DMPS or DMPA treatment increased methylarsonate
excretion but DMSA did not. Arsenate excretion increased after DMPS or DMSA
treatment but was not affected by DMPA treatment. These results suggest that the 
dimercaptans, in addition to increasing arsenic excretion, also influence the
biotransformation of arsenite to less toxic species. The different effects on the
urinary excretion of arsenic metabolites suggest that these dimercaptan metal
binding agents have mechanisms of action in addition to simple chelation of
inorganic arsenic.

The effect of DMSA loading on the renal handling of technetium-99m in rats.

Provoost AP, Van Aken M.

The renal handling of technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc DMSA) was
studied in rats treated with high doses of nonradioactive DMSA to inhibit the
renal uptake mechanism(s). A static scan was obtained 1 hour after the
intravenous (iv) injection of 99mTc DMSA and the radioactivity in kidneys and
bladder was calculated as a percentage of the injected amount. Total glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow were also determined.
Preloading with DMSA caused a fall in the renal accumulation of 99mTc DMSA
together with a small increase in the amount excreted into the urinary bladder.
Despite a stable GFR, the total amount of 99mTc DMSA handled by the kidneys
(i.e., renal plus bladder activity) was reduced. These findings are compatible
with the hypothesis that peritubular uptake and subsequent intracellular fixation
are of importance in the renal accumulation of 99mTc DMSA. On the other hand, the
radioactivity excreted into the urine probably stems from non-reabsorbed 99mTc
DMSA initially filtered by the glomeruli.

The design of a pentavalent 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinate complex as a tumor imaging 
agent.

Yokoyama A, Hata N, Horiuchi K, Masuda H, Saji H, Ohta H, Yamamoto K, Endo K,
Torizuka K.

In our search for a technetium-tumor seeking agent, the chemical characteristic
of polynuclear Ga-citrate attracted our attention. On this basis, we selected the
ligand dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMS) and appropriate labeling conditions in the
design of 99mTc(V)-DMS. Chemical characterization was performed by thin layer
chromatography, electrophoresis, Sephadex column chromatography and
spectrophotometric studies at the chemical concentration (99Tc). Biodistribution 
in mice bearing Ehrlich ascites tumor and scintigraphic images in VX-2
tumor-bearing rabbit, indicated the great applicability of 99mTc(V)-DMS as a new 
tumor imaging agent. Its distinctive characteristic, different from the kidney
imaging agent (99mTc-DMSA) is demonstrated and the biological implication of
hydrolytic polynucleation of pentavalent technetium, through an anionic specie
Tc(V)O3-(4), in the tumor cell is discussed.

Differential renal function in unilateral renal injury: possible effects of
radiopharmaceutical choice.

Taylor A Jr, Lallone R.

An abnormal filtration fraction or a significant divergence between a kidney's
ability to extract Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and other function
parameters, such as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or the effective renal
plasma flow (ERPF), could lead to different estimates of relative or absolute
renal function, depending on the radiopharmaceutical administered. To evaluate
this possible divergence, we measured the relative GFR (I-125 iothalamate), ERPF 
(I-131 hippurate), and Tc-99m DMSA accumulation in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats
with unilateral ureteral obstruction or unilateral ischemia at various times
after renal injury. The relative ERPF of the obstructed kidney was significantly 
greater than the relative GFR at all time periods studied; significant but less
dramatic differences were noted comparing DMSA with GFR in obstruction and DMSA
and ERPF with GFR in ischemia. In evaluating renal disease, it is important to
consider the functional parameter reflected by the administered
radiopharmaceutical as well as the underlying disease state.

Scintigraphic detection of experimental myocardial infarction with
99mTc-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Duska F, Novák J, Mazurová Y, Kubícek J, Vizd'a J, Kafka P, Veverková O.

Acute myocardial infarctions were produced by ligature of the left frontal
descending coronary artery in 9 dogs. The possibility of scintigraphic imaging
with 99mTc-DMSA 4 hrs after intravenous administration was studied. The
infarctions were 4, 24 and 48 hrs old. The in vivo scan was positive in only one 
dog with a 4-hr old infarction. The in vivo scans were confirmed by the analysis 
of the radioactivity in tissue samples. The accumulation of the
radiopharmaceutical increased slightly in 48-hr old lesions; however, this
increase was not sufficient for a positive scintigraphic finding. Thus, we do not
recommend 99mTc-DMSA for clinical use in acute lesions.

Intravascular contrast agents suitable for magnetic resonance imaging.

Runge VM, Clanton JA, Herzer WA, Gibbs SJ, Price AC, Partain CL, James AE Jr.

Two paramagnetic chelates, chromium EDTA and gadolinium DTPA, were evaluated as
potential intravenous contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MR) using a
0.5-T superconducting scanner. After evaluating both agents in vitro, in vivo
studies were conducted in dogs to document changes in renal appearance produced
by contrast injection. Acute splenic and renal infarction were diagnosed with
contrast-enhanced MR and confirmed by gamma camera imaging following
administration of Tc-99m-labeled DMSA and sulfur colloid. The authors conclude
that intravenous paramagnetic contrast agents presently offer the best mechanism 
for assessment of tissue function and changes in perfusion with MR.

A methylmercury toxicity model to test for possible adverse effects resulting
from chelating agent therapy.

Kostyniak PJ, Soiefer AI.

A daily dosing model for methylmercury (MM) intoxication was developed for the
purpose of testing for possible adverse effects resulting from the administration
of complexing agents used in the treatment of MM poisoning. The dithiol
complexing agents 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BAL) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) were chosen to test the discriminative ability of this model, since
the former is contraindicated for MM poisoning and causes an increase in target
organ MM burden, while the latter compound is known to be efficacious in reducing
both toxicity and brain MM content. The basic design of the model called for
daily observation of treated animals with identification of the following signs
of MM intoxication: loss of body weight, onset of signs of toxicity, and
mortality. The degree of toxicity was evaluated, and a toxicity score (0-5) was
provided for each animal. A dose-dependent decrease in body weight was found in
MM-treated mice. The latent period for development of signs of intoxication
varied inversely with the dose rate. The rate of progression of severity of signs
of intoxication was also dependent upon the dose. A dose rate of 14 mg Hg per kg 
per day was utilized to test the effects of BAL and DMSA on the onset and
progression of signs of MM intoxication. Onset and progression of signs of
methylmercury intoxication were similar for animals receiving methylmercury
either alone or with administration of BAL at 2 mg per kg per day. Animals which 
received BAL at a dose rate of 20 mg per kg per day developed signs of
intoxication significantly earlier.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Differential responses to methylmercury exposure and recovery in neuroblastoma
and glioma cells and fibroblasts.

Sager PR, Syversen TL.

The effects of methylmercury (MeHg) on cytoplasmic microtubules in cultured
neuroblastoma cells, glioma cells, and fibroblasts were compared. Neuroblastoma
cells appeared to be more sensitive to disruption of microtubules by MeHg than
the glioma cells or fibroblasts; cellular concentrations of mercury after MeHg
were also higher in neuroblastoma cells. Recovery of microtubule structure was
monitored in cells after removal of MeHg; addition of the chelating
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) increased reassembly of microtubules. During MeHg 
treatment and early recovery, microtubule integrity was dependent on cellular
mercury concentrations. However, after prolonged DMSA exposure, mercury appeared 
to reenter the cell, without causing dissociation of microtubules.

Comparative effects of N,N-disubstituted dithiocarbamates and dimercaptosuccinate
on mobilization of methylmercury in mice.

Gale GR, Atkins LM, Smith AB, Walker EM Jr, Jones MM.

Diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) and five of its N,N-disubstituted analogs were
compared with dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) for effectiveness in mobilizing and
promoting excretion of methylmercury (MeHg) following administration of a
sublethal dose of MeHg labeled with Me203Hg. The previously reported
effectiveness of DMSA was confirmed. Of the dithiocarbamates assessed, only
di(carboxymethyl)-dithiocarbamate (DCDC) was active in mobilizing MeHg, and its
activity on a molar dose basis was less than that of DMSA. The disparate
structural requirements of dithiocarbamates as antagonists of MeHg and of cadmium
were discussed.

Okamura Y, Ohishi K, et al.

Ultrasound-guided renal cyst puncture was performed on 22 cysts which were then
95% ethanol instilled to prevent recurrence of cystic fluid. Cystic lesions
disappeared on the ultrasonogram in the follow-up period of 3 to 28 months. On
CT, cystic lesions became smaller size but did not disappear. Average CT numbers 
of the cyst were 8.75 +/- 3.83 before and 12.96 +/- 3.27 after ethanol
instillation. The cystic wall became thicker. Caliceal distortion and/or pelvis
compression by cystic lesions improved on IVP 2 to 3 days after ethanol
instillation. The renal image on Tc-99m-DMSA scintigram showed morphological
improvement and DMSA renal uptake rate increased slightly but significantly 2 to 
4 weeks after ethanol instillation. There were no major complications with this
procedure except for one case in which the tip of the catheter became stuck in
the cyst and broke off when the catheter was removed. A slight local irritable
pain was noticed in all cases. Half of the patients had hot flushes and/or
somewhat drunken sense but these symptoms were only temporary. Antabuse
phenomenon appeared in one case with concomitant use of a cephem antibiotics
after ethanol instillation. This method of therapy is a safe non-surgical
approach to treat renal cysts. 95% ethanol instillation in the cyst seems to
prevent recurrence of cystic fluid.

DMSA, DMPS, and DMPA--as arsenic antidotes.

Aposhian HV, Carter DE, Hoover TD, Hsu CA, Maiorino RM, Stine E.

meso-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid, Na
salt (DMPS), and N-(2,3- dimercaptopropyl )- phthalamidic acid (DMPA) are water
soluble analogs of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (BAL). The relative effectiveness or
therapeutic index of these dimercapto compounds in protecting mice from the
lethal effects of an LD99 of sodium arsenite is DMSA greater than DMPS greater
than DMPA greater than BAL in the magnitude of 42:14:4:1, respectively. DMPS,
DMPA, or DMSA will mobilize tissue arsenic. BAL, however, increases the arsenic
content of the brain of rabbits injected with sodium arsenite. These results
raise the question as to the appropriateness of BAL as the treatment for systemic
arsenic poisoning. Either DMSA or DMPS, when given sc or po, will protect rabbits
against the lethal systemic effects of subcutaneously administered Lewisite .
DMPS and DMSA have promise as prophylactics for the prevention of the vesicant
action of Lewisite . The sodium arsenite inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
(PDH) complex can be prevented and reversed in vitro or in vivo by DMPS, DMSA,
DMPA, or BAL. Of them all, DMPS is most potent and BAL appears to be the least
potent. The usefulness of all these dimercapto compounds would be enhanced by a
careful study of their metabolism and biotransformation. These dimercapto
compounds are in a great many respects orphan drugs. At this stage of their
development, it is very difficult for the clinician to obtain funds to study them
clinically even though they appear to be useful for treatment of poisoning by any
one of the heavy metals.

The adsorption of 99Tcm dimercaptosuccinic acid onto injection vials.

Millar AM.

It is common practice to dispense radiopharmaceuticals into empty sterile vials
for dispatch to the departments where they are to be administered. It has been
noted that on withdrawal of technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid injections
(99Tcm-DMSA) which have been dispensed into such vials, the activities obtained
are lower than expected. To explain this phenomenon, the adsorption of 99Tcm-DMSA
onto commercially available, empty, sterile vials has been investigated. The
99Tcm-DMSA solutions were prepared using kits from two manufacturers and were
tested in vials from two manufacturers and the original kit vials. Adsorption of 
99Tcm in one DMSA/vial combination after storage for 4 h was 49.6% (+/- 4.5%
S.E.M.), but typically, adsorption was approximately 12% after 4 h. Although rate
of adsorption was found to vary with storage conditions, no conditions
satisfactorily overcame the effect. In vials from one manufacturer, the 99Tcm
adsorption was predominantly on the glass, while in vials from the other, it was 
predominantly on the rubber stopper. It is concluded that the compatibility
between vials and radiopharmaceuticals must be investigated in the hospital
radiopharmacy.

Interaction of chelating agents with cadmium in mice and rats.

Eybl V, Sýkora J, Koutenský J, Caisová D, Schwartz A, Mertl F.

The influence of several chelating agents (CaDTPA, ZnDTPA, CaEDTA, ZnEDTA, DMSA, 
D-penicillamine and DMPS, DMP and DDC) on the acute toxicity of CdCl2 and on the 
whole body retention and tissue distribution of cadmium after the IV application 
of 115mCdCl2 was compared in mice. The chelating agents were applied immediately 
after the application of cadmium. CaDTPA, ZnDTPA and DMSA appeared to be the most
effective antidotes. However, DMSA increased the amount of cadmium retained in
kidneys. The treatment of cadmium-poisoned mice with the combination of DMSA (IP)
and ZnDTPA (SC) (all the compounds were injected in equimolar dose) decreased the
toxicity of cadmium more than treatment with one chelating agents (given in a 2:1
dose). However, by studying the effect of these chelating agents and their
combination of the retention and distribution of Cd in mice, it was demonstrated 
that the combined application of the antidotes showed little or no improvement
over the results obtained with the most effective of the individual components.
In the urine of rats injected with CdCl2 and treated with the chelating agents
(CaDTPA, ZnDTPA, DMSA), the presence of cadmium complexes was demonstrated. The
formation of mixed ligand chelates in vivo was not proved. Experiments in mice
given a single injection of 115mCd-labeled Cd complexes of DMPS, DMSA and DTPA
showed a high retention of cadmium in the organisms after the IV application of
CdDMPS and CdDMSA complexes.

Alteration of tissue disposition of cadmium by chelating agents.

Klaassen CD, Waalkes MP, Cantilena LR Jr.

The effect of several chelating agents (diethyldithiocarbamic acid, DDC;
nitrilotriacetic acid, NTA; 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, BAL; d,l-penicillamine, PEN; 
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA; ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, EDTA; and
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, DTPA) on the toxicity, distribution and
excretion of cadmium (Cd) was determined in mice. When chelators were
administered immediately after Cd, significant increases in survival were noted
after treatment with DMSA, EDTA, and DTPA. DTPA, followed by EDTA and then DMSA, 
were consistently the most effective in decreasing the tissue concentrations of
Cd and increasing the excretion of Cd. NTA, BAL, DDC and PEN had no beneficial
effects. The effects of increasing the time interval between Cd administration
and initiation of chelation therapy was determined by using a single
administration of DTPA, EDTA, and DMSA. Mice treated immediately after Cd
administration excreted approximately 50% of the administered dose of Cd compared
to 0.2% in controls. Treatment with chelator at later times significantly
increased Cd excretion but the magnitude of the effect was much less than that
seen in mice treated immediately after Cd. To determine the role of MT in the
acute decrease in chelator efficacy following Cd poisoning, rats were injected IV
with Cd followed by DTPA at various times after Cd. Although DTPA reduced Cd
content in the various organs when given immediately after Cd, the chelator was
ineffective at all later times. Increases in hepatic and renal metallothionein
(MT) did not occur until 2 hr after Cd, and did not coincide with the earlier
drop in chelator efficacy. Blockade of MT synthesis by actinomycin D failed to
eliminate this decreased DTPA effectiveness. Therefore, it appears that MT does
not play an important role in the acute decrease in efficacy of chelation therapy
for Cd poisoning. The effect of repeated daily administration of chelators on the
distribution and excretion of Cd was studied by administering chelators daily for
5 days starting 48 hr after Cd. DTPA, EDTA, DMSA and BAL significantly increased 
the urinary elimination of Cd. Thus, mobilization of Cd into urine occurs with
repeated chelation therapy, which may decrease tissue concentrations of Cd and
reduce the toxicity of the metal.

essentially equal: faster blood clearances, reduced urinary excretions and higher
fixations of A in the target compensated for the increased liver uptake. On the
other hand, the scan quality in the CRF patients was definitely superior with A, 
allowing detection of residual functioning parenchyma also in severe kidney
failure. Correlation between the net kidney uptake 6 hrs p.i. and the separate
hippuran clearance rate was better with A than with DMSA, indicating the
feasibility of A in evaluating relative renal function.

[Quantification of separate renal function using Tc 99m DTPA and Tc 99m DMSA.
Correlations between individual isotopic data and creatinine clearance].

[Article in French]

Chevet D, Moisan A, Le Pogamp P, Le Cloirec J, Wehbe B, Herry JY.

The purpose of this prospective study (30 controls and 100 renal patients) is to 
compare one to each other the values of renal function measured with: 1--the DTPA
99mTc , 2--the DMSA 99mTc , and 3--the creatinine clearance. After the control
values being established, correlations are done for the whole group (n = 130)
between the creatinine clearance, the DTPA 99mTc clearance and the fixation rate 
of the DMSA 99mTc . The correlations obtained are:--Clcr Versus Cldtpa =
0,91.--Clcr Versus % Dmsa = 0,90. - Cldtpa Versus % Dmsa = 0,93. and indicate the
two isotopic tests performed give similar quantitative results than creatinine
clearance. Camera and computer allow to measure the separate renal function one
by one, the two isotopic test giving similar values for each kidney. The results 
of these studies give a good concordance with the observed diseases, except for
partial renal artery stenosis. The pyelic retention of DMSA 99mTc product, in
condition of ureteral compression, gives a potential overestimation of this test 
and is a matter to debate. The extreme simplicity and facility of DMSA 99mTc
procedures make this investigation accessible to any patient and give excellent
morphological and functional tests. DTPA 99mTc clearances--global and separate
kidney--give a more sensitive approach than DMSA 99mTc does because vascular
captation , elimination rates could be focused. DTPA 99mTc procedure is to be
used in patients with transplanted kidney, silent IVP kidney, contrast media
contraindication or for exploring glomerular clearance without urine collection.

In vivo estimation of renal volume using a rotating gamma camera for
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal imaging.

Kawamura J, Itoh H, Yoshida O, Fujita T, Torizuka K.

The in vivo renal volume was determined using SPECT for 99mTc -DMSA renal
imaging. The total renal volume was derived by summing the DMSA distribution
volumes of the transaxial slices in the whole kidney. In 20 healthy subjects the 
renal volume in the right kidney was 220 ml for men and 195.2 ml for women, while
that in the left kidney was 213 ml for men and 193.7 ml for women. Differences in
those values were not statistically significant. A good correlation was found
between renal volumes in both kidneys and body surface area. In 106 kidneys
including solitary and pathological kidneys, individual renal volume correlated
well with individual DMSA renal uptake rate which demonstrates cortical
functioning mass, depending on the cortical blood flow. Thus, SPECT enables an
accurate noninvasive means of estimating in vivo functioning renal volume.

Reversible diminished renal 99mTc-DMSA uptake during converting-enzyme inhibition
in a patient with renal artery stenosis.

Hovinga TK, Beukhof JR, van Luyk WH, Piers DA, Donker AJ.

A patient is described who had accelerated hypertension and unilateral renal
artery stenosis, and who developed further deterioration in renal function during
treatment with captopril, an angiotension-I (AI) converting-enzyme inhibitor.
99mTc-DMSA uptake was greatly diminished in the stenotic kidney, although renal
blood flow and handling of 131I-hippurate was preserved. Uptake of 99mTc-DMSA in 
the affected kidney returned after substitution of captopril by the vasodilator
minoxidil, while a comparable degree of blood pressure control was maintained.
Thus, caution must be taken when interpreting results of 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy 
in patients with proven or suspected renal artery stenosis treated with an AI
converting-enzyme inhibiting drug. Moreover, our finding points to the importance
of glomerular filtration in the renal handling of 99mTc-DMSA.

99mTc-aprotinin: a new tracer for kidney morphology and function.

Bianchi C, Donadio C, Tramonti G, Lorusso P, Bellitto L, Lunghi F.

Aprotinin (Ap), a low-molecular-weight polypeptide (6500 dalton), is a protease
inhibitor which is electively and stably accumulated in the kidney. In 112 adult 
patients, with either uni- or bilateral renal disease with different degrees of
renal impairment (from normal GFR to advanced renal failure), renal scans were
performed by means of Ap labelled with 99mTc. Highly satisfactory renal scans
were obtained in all patients. In 20 patients with renal failure (serum
creatinine 1.8-8.5 mg/dl, mean 4.7) a comparison was made of the renal scans
obtained with 99mTc-Ap and with 99mTc-DMSA. 99mTc-Ap was slightly better than
99mTc-DMSA, especially in patients with far advanced renal failure. Some aspects 
of the pharmacokinetics of 99mTc-Ap were studied in 72 cases. In 22 of these
patients plasma clearance of 99mTc-Ap was determined by the single injection
method using a two-compartment model. In patients with GFR greater than 90 ml/min
plasma clearance of 99mTc-Ap was 67.6 +/- 8.4 SD ml/min. A good correlation was
observed between plasma clearance of 99mTc-Ap and GFR (r = 0.74). After IV
injection 99mTc-Ap was stably fixed by the kidney. Renal radioactivity remained
stable between the second and eighth hour after the injection. Urinary excretion 
of radioactivity measured in 35 patients in the first and in the second 2-h
interval after IV injection of 99mTc-Ap was negligible in all patients (2.7 +/-
1.5 SD percent of the dose in the first 2 h; 2.8 +/- 1.4 SD between the second
and fourth hour). 99mTc-Ap is an excellent agent for renal imaging. It also seems
promising for renal function studies.

Is the relative 99mTc-DMSA clearance a useful marker of proximal tubular
dysfunction?

van Luijk WH, Ensing GJ, Meijer S, Donker AJ, Piers DA.

The clearance of 125I-sodium iothalamate, 131I-sodium hippurate, 99mTc-DMSA, and 
beta 2-microglobulin were determined in 20 patients with proven or suspected
proximal tubular dysfunction and in 18 control patients with various renal
diseases. A clear distinction in the relative 99mTc-DMSA clearance was observed
between patients with proximal tubulopathy (14%-35%) and control patients (less
than 14%). A similar difference between the two groups was found in the relative 
beta 2-microglobulin clearance. Nine patients with proximal tubulopathy showed an
elevated filtration fraction versus only two control patients. The renal handling
of 99mTc-DMSA seems to be an indicator of proximal tubular function.

[Clinical study concerning upper urinary tract obstruction. 2. Relationship
between 99mTc-DMSA uptake in obstructed kidneys and their functions].

[Article in Japanese]

Murayama T, Yamada T, Taguchi H, Watanabe Y, Tasei Y.

To establish a method of detecting divided renal function of the obstructed
kidneys noninvasively, comparative studies on 99mTc -DMSA uptake (60 minutes
after injection), I 131-hippuran renal uptake (1-2 minutes after injection) and
divided creatinine clearance immediately after relief of urinary obstruction were
made on 24 cases of obstructive uropathy. A close significant correlation was
obtained between 99mTc -DMSA and I 131-hippuran renal uptakes (gamma = 0.8809, P 
less than 0.001). Also, a significant correlation was noted between 99mTc -DMSA
renal uptake and divided creatinine clearance (gamma = 0.7876, P less than
0.001), but the latter constantly gave lower values than the former. These
observations led us to conclude that 99mTc -DMSA renal uptake is a reliable
indicator of the renal plasma flow in the obstructed kidneys. Quantitative
divided renal function of the obstructed kidneys can be estimated by the 99mTc
-DMSA uptake method.

Stability of the radiopharmaceutical [99mTc]DMSA: study of the ligand exchange
reaction with [99Tc]EDTA.

Garcia Muñoz M, Garcia Domenech R, Galvez Alvarez J, Moreno Frigols J.

A kinetic study was made of the ligand exchange reaction between [99mTc]EDTA and 
DMSA. The results of this study indicate that this exchange reaction is closely
related to temperature and pH. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters demonstrate
that both complexes--[99MTc]EDTA and [99mTc]DMSA--have a similar stability.
Furthermore, the existence of an acid-basic catalysis for the global exchange
reaction was established, and the catalytic parameters were calculated. These
data were obtained by radiochromatography and visible spectrophotometry.

DL- and meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid: in vitro and in vivo studies with sodium
arsenite.

Aposhian HV, Hsu CA, Hoover TD.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been receiving increasing interest as an
antidote for poisoning by heavy metals. Of the various isomeric forms, meso-DMSA 
has been studied most extensively because its preparation and purification are
relatively easy. Using a variety of in vitro and in vivo procedures, we have
investigated and compared DL- and meso-DMSA as antidotes for sodium arsenite. The
two forms of DMSA are equally effective in preventing or reversing, in vitro, the
arsenite inhibition of the activity of mouse kidney pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) 
complex, DL-DMSA, however, is superior to meso-DMSA for the in vivo reversal of
PDH activity as measured in vitro. The LD50 values of DL- and meso-DMSA in the
mouse were 10.84 and 13.73 mmol/kg, ip, respectively. The ED50 values of the two 
DMSA forms were not significantly different in mice receiving a LD99 dose of
sodium arsenite. DL- and meso-DMSA were equally effective in mobilizing tissue
74As of rabbits. The activity of DMSA as an arsenic antidote appeared to be
independent of its isomeric structural configuration. There did not appear to be 
any great advantage in using DL-DMSA instead of meso-DMSA as an arsenic antidote.

Renal artery stenosis and hypertension after abdominal irradiation for Hodgkin
disease. Successful treatment with nephrectomy.

Salvi S, Green DM, Brecher ML, Magoos I, Gamboa LN, Fisher JE, Baliah T, Afshani 
E.

Hypertension secondary to stenosis of the left renal artery developed in a
thirteen-year-old male six years after completion of inverted Y irradiation
(3,600 rad) for abdominal Hodgkin disease. Surgical treatment with nephrectomy
resulted in control of the hypertension without the use of antihypertensive
agents. We review the literature for this unusual complication of abdominal
irradiation, and recommend that a 99mTc-DMSA renal scan, selective renal vein
sampling for renin determinations, and renal arteriography be performed on any
patient in whom hypertension develops following abdominal irradiation in
childhood.

99mTc-DMSA scanning to diagnose pyelonephritic scarring in children.

Kogan BA, Kay R, Wasnick RJ, Carty H.

99mTechnetium-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scanning provides
superior quality images of renal parenchymal detail, which makes it highly
sensitive for the diagnosis of pyelonephritic scarring. Unlike most other imaging
techniques, radionuclide scanning is not affected by bowel gas or bony structures
overlying the kidneys. This makes it particularly useful in children.
Furthermore, renal scarring can be demonstrated by 99mTc-DMSA even before the
classic gross anatomic and radiologic changes are present. The use of 99mTc-DMSA 
scanning in over 300 children has demonstrated its benefits and advantages over
standard radiographic techniques.

Interaction of methylmercury with microtubules in cultured cells and in vitro.

Sager PR, Doherty RA, Olmsted JB.

The effects of methylmercury (MeHg) on cytoplasmic microtubules in cultured
fibroblasts and on the in vitro polymerization of microtubules were examined.
MeHg caused disruption of cellular microtubules in a concentration- and
time-dependent manner. Addition of the metal-chelating agent, dimercaptosuccinic 
acid (DMSA), both prevented and reversed the effect of MeHg. Comparisons of the
cellular levels of mercury and microtubule integrity indicated that microtubules 
dissociated at levels higher than 0.6 microgram Hg/mg protein. In vitro
polymerization was also directly inhibited by MeHg; this effect was prevented by 
the addition of DMSA.

Congenital renal anomaly: evaluation with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal
scintigraphy.

Hosokawa S, Kawamura J, Tomoyoshi T, Yoshida O.

Technetium 99m-2,3, dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) preferentially
accumulates in the renal cortex, demonstrating functioning cortical mass. We used
99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy in ten patients with horseshoe kidneys and five
patients with unilateral fused kidneys. The results show that 99mTc-DMSA renal
scintigraphy reliably establishes the diagnosis of horseshoe kidney and clearly
shows the isthmus, which is very essential for proper management. The technique
also aids in the definitive assessment of separate kidney function and of total
radionuclide uptake is possible using 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy.

Methylmercury removal in the dog during infusion of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA).

Kostyniak PJ.

2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been utilized in chelation therapy and in 
extracorporal complexing hemodialysis therapy for experimental methylmercury
intoxication. In the latter application, substantial excretion of methylmercury
occurred by the urinary route. This prompted the current study of the effects of 
continuous intravenous DMSA infusion therapy on methylmercury kinetics in the
dog. Animals previously dosed with 203Hg-labeled methylmercury at 2.5 mg Hg/kg
received a priming dose of DMSA, followed by a continuous iv infusion at dose
rates that resulted in DMSA concentrations in plasma similar to those observed
during DMSA complexing hemodialysis therapy. The kinetics of 203Hg removal in
DMSA-infused dogs was compared with both saline-infused controls and DMSA
complexing hemodialysis treated dogs. DMSA infusion therapy resulted in a shift
in 203Hg binding within systemic blood from the red-cell fraction into plasma.
This was consistent with an observed association of DMSA with the plasma
fraction. The shift in 203Hg from red cells into plasma was paralleled by an
increase in urinary clearance of 203Hg during the DMSA infusion period. In four
dogs treated in this fashion, an average of 6.5 micrograms of mercury was removed
by the urinary route over the 5-h treatment period, compared to 0.007 micrograms 
in the saline-infused dogs. Although a similar magnitude of mercury output into
urine was observed during DMSA complexing hemodialysis, an additional 5
micrograms was removed by the dialyzer, making that technique 1.5 times as
effective as infusion therapy. Comparing 203Hg tissue concentration after DMSA
infusion therapy with the saline-treated controls revealed a 6.5-fold decrease in
liver, a 3-fold reduction in kidney, and a 27% reduction in cerebrum. No
significant differences were observed in medulla or cerebellum. Histopathology
revealed no consistent differences between DMSA-treated and saline-treated
animals. The DMSA infusion therapy was effective in causing a rapid removal of
203Hg from animals previously dosed with 203Hg-labeled methylmercury. DMSA
infusion therapy may provide a useful therapeutic alternative for methylmercury
poisoning when rapid removal of the intoxicant is desired and hemodialysis
equipment and expertise are not readily available.

Influence of chelating agents on the distribution and excretion of cadmium in
rats.

Planas-Bohne F, Lehmann M.

The effects of the chelating agents CaNa2-ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA),
CaNa3-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA), 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 
2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BAL), and 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) and of
the lipophilic chelating agents Puchel, Puchel-bisamidocysteineethyl ester
(Puch-D), and EDTA-bis-amidocysteineethyl ester (EDTA-D) on the distribution of
iv injected Cd were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The chelating agents
were injected iv as single doses given 10 sec, 1 hr, or 3 hr after 3 mumol/kg Cd 
+ 115mCd. When the chelating agents were injected within 10 sec after the metal, 
all agents reduced the total body cadmium burden by varying extents ranging from 
3% of that in untreated control rats after 0.01 mmol BAL/kg to 94% following 0.1 
mmol DTPA/kg. When given 1 hr after Cd injection, the efficacy of all the agents 
tested was markedly reduced or abolished; at this time only Puchel and Puch-D
provoked significant reductions in the body burden of Cd by 21 and 32%,
respectively. When treatment was delayed until 3 hr after Cd injection, only
Puch-D was able to reduce the body and liver burden of the metal by 14 and 9%,
respectively. Combined treatment with Puchel + DTPA, BAL + DTPA, or BAL + DMPS
did not enhance Cd removal to an extent greater than that expected from the
equivalent dose of the more effective agent of that pair alone. Repeated
administration of DTPA, 20 X 0.1 mmol/kg, during 4 weeks by ip or po
administration of the same dose in the drinking water over 4 weeks, was no no
more effective than the first dose of the chelating agent alone. Gel
chromatographic studies of the distribution of Cd among the proteins of the liver
cytosol in treated and untreated animals indicate that neither DTPA nor Puchel
was able to release Cd from the metallothionein complex.

Isolated rat hepatocytes as a model system for screening chelators for use in
cadmium intoxication.

Cantilena LR Jr, Stacey NH, Klaassen CD.

The utility of isolated rat hepatocytes as a model system for screening potential
chelators in treatment of Cd intoxication was studied. The ability of the
chelators diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), diethyldithiocarbamic acid
(DDC), d,1-penicillamine (PEN), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), and
2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BAL) to decrease the cellular concentration of Cd was
correlated with the previously reported effectiveness of these agents in the
treatment of Cd intoxication in vivo. The results of cellular studies with either
control or metallothionein-induced hepatocytes were compared to the in vivo
effect of the chelators administered before or after the induction of
metallothionein, respectively. The effects of DTPA, EDTA, DDC, and BAL in the
hepatocyte model screening system correlated well with their reported in vivo
effects. The results with NTA, PEN, and DMSA were not correlated as well but were
explained by the relative differences between in vivo doses versus in vitro
concentrations of the respective chelators. Therefore, the proposed model for
screening potential chelators for use in cadmium intoxication appears to be a
system which may prove to be an economical and rapid method to facilitate the
search for efficacious chelators.

[Pyeloureteral junction syndrome in children. Apropos of 178 cases].

[Article in French]

Juskiewenski S, Moscovici J, Bouissou F, Vaysse P, Guitard J.

The authors review 178 cases of anomalies of the pyelo-ureteric junction, with a 
total of 189 anomalies. Almost one half of the cases were less than 5 years old
(47.2%) and about 1/4 were less than 1 year old (24.7%). In girls, the incident
which reveals the diagnosis is most often an infection and in boys, it is pain or
haematuria. 26% of the cases had an associated urological lesion (23 cases of
vesico-ureteric reflux, 8 cases of renal stones, 5 cases of mega-ureter and 4
cases of horseshoe kidney). 133 children were operated, essentially by resection 
of the pyelo-ureteric junction with an upstream by-pass. From the 126 cases with 
sufficient follow-up, 48 (38.1%) obtained great improvement, 63 (50%) a moderate 
improvement and 15 (11.9%), a stabilisation of the dilatation. In all cases
except 3, the pyelo-ureteric junction was perfectly catheterizable. The
histological lesions of the junction were variable and difficult to systematise, 
but usually extended beyond the junction to involve a large part of the pelvis.
The variability of the caliceal dilatation makes any attempt at classification
difficult. The authors recommend cystography in every case, as associated reflux 
was discovered in 16% of cases. Retrograde uretero-pyelography is practically no 
longer indicated. The isotope kidney scan with DTPA technetium, with a
hyper-diuresis test, is often used, as it gives an idea about the clearance of
filtration and about the degree of obstruction. Quantitative DMSA kidney scan can
reveal the effects on the renal parenchyma. Conservation of the isthmus of a
horseshoe kidney never interferes with the uretero-pyelic re-implantation. After 
correction of the anomaly of the uretero-pyelic junction, 5 cases of unilateral
reflux out of 8 and 3 cases of bilateral reflux out of 10 resolved spontaneously.

Low renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA in patients with proximal tubular dysfunction.

van Luÿk WH, Ensing GJ, Piers DA.

In nine patients with different types of proximal tubulopathy and a nearly normal
glomerular filtration rate a low uptake of 99mTc-DMSA in kidneys was found. The
underlying mechanism seems to be an increased urinary excretion of 99mTc-DMSA.
This radiopharmaceutical might be used as a marker of proximal tubular
dysfunction.

Evaluation of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal uptake as an index of
individual kidney function after acute ureteral obstruction and desobstruction.
An experimental study in rats.

Schelfhout W, Simons M, Oosterlinck W, De Sy WA.

The evolution of the 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal uptake is
followed after ligation of the right ureter in rats. The DMSA uptake falls
rapidly from 35% before ligation to 13% after 24 h, and decreases further to 1.5%
after 31 days. The ligated ureter was desobstructed after 10, 17, 24 and 31 days,
respectively, DMSA uptake was controlled 4, 11 and 18 days after desobstruction. 
In the first group, deobstruction after 10 days, the DMSA uptake rose from 7 to
15%, while in the fourth group it rose from 1.5 to 2%. It is concluded that DMSA 
uptake provides a reliable index for renal function after acute urinary tract
obstruction in rats. If the DMSA uptake has fallen below 4% very little renal
function can be expected to be regained, whereas above 4% the function can
improve considerably.

Comparative effects of diethyldithiocarbamate, dimercaptosuccinate, and
diethylenetriaminepentaacetate on organ distribution and excretion of cadmium.

Gale GR, Atkins LM, Walker EM Jr, Smith AB.

Diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA), and
diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) were compared for their relative efficacies
at equimolar doses in promoting mobilization of metallothionein-bound cadmium
(Cd) from its sites of deposition several weeks after i.p. injection of a
sublethal dose of Cd containing 109Cd. Routes and rates of excretion were also
determined. The most rapid and extensive reduction of renal, hepatic, and splenic
Cd was obtained with DDTC. Concurrently, however, DDTC caused moderate increases 
in lung, testicular, and heart Cd burdens, and increased the brain burden about
ten-fold. Only renal and testicular levels of Cd were reduced by DTPA, and it was
much less effective than DDTC in lowering the renal levels. No reduction of Cd
levels in any organ was attained with DMSA treatment. Excretion of Cd following
DDTC treatment was exclusively by the fecal route; DTPA promoted both urinary and
fecal excretion, but the total amount excreted by both routes was considerably
less than that observed following DDTC treatment. It was concluded that the
effectiveness of a chelator in promoting mobilization and excretion of
metallothionein-bound Cd cannot be predicted on the basis of its effectiveness in
protecting mice against a lethal dose of Cd when given immediately after Cd and
prior to induction of metallothionein synthesis. The possibility is discussed
that the greater effectiveness of DDTC may be due to an interaction with nascent 
metallothionein rather than to chelation of Cd.

Anti-lewisite activity and stability of meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid and
2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid.

Aposhian HV, Mershon MM, Brinkley FB, Hsu CA, Hackley BE.

Meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and the sodium salt of
2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) are analogous in chemical structure 
to dimercaprol (BAL, British Anti-Lewisite). Dimercaprol was among the first
therapeutically useful metal chelating agents and was developed originally as an 
anti-lewisite agent. Either DMSA or DMPS protects rabbits from the lethal
systemic action of dichloro(2-chlorovinyl)arsine (29.7 mumols/kg, also known as
lewisite. The analogs are active in this respect when given either sc or po. The 
stability of each of the three dimercapto compounds in distilled H2O, pH 7.0 at
24 degrees, has been examined for seven days. DMSA retained 82% of its mercapto
groups, but no titratable mercapto groups remained in the DMPS or BAL solutions. 
At pH 5.0, however, there was no striking difference in the stability of the
three dimercapto compounds (78-87%) over a seven day period. DMSA and DMPS
warrant further investigation as water soluble metal binding agents in both in
vivo and in vitro experiments.

Neurotoxicity, anorexia and the preferential choice of antidote in methylmercury 
intoxicated rats.

Magos L.

In the rat the first clinical signs of methylmercury intoxication is loss of
appetite, which can be restored by the administration of dimercaptosuccinic acid 
(DMSA). In female rats which lost body weight as a result of methylmercury
treatment, the anorexic effect of methylmercury was reversed even when DMSA was
given in the drinking water. When intoxicated animals had the choice between DMSA
supplemented water (2.5 mg DMSA/ml) and tap water, they preferred DMSA. This
preference is related to the severity of intoxication and is abolished after one 
or two days. During this time the urinary mercury excretion is substantially
increased and the body burden of methylmercury is decreased. The effect of
methylmercury mobilization is fast, and can be detected in urine collected from
cannulated ureters shortly after the IV administration of 10 or 20 mg/kg
dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Optimizing renal DMSA-scintigraphy with 7-pinhole collimator.

Botsch H, Pottmeyer A, Savaser A, Lochner B, Felix R.

Multiple pinhole emission tomographic imaging techniques are currently being
applied to imaging of organs of a limited size. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate the feasibility of this technique in kidney imaging with Tc99m-DMSA. A
7-pinhole collimator having 4.5 mm. pinhole apertures was used in conjunction
with a widefield camera. Left and right kidney were imaged separately. Twelve
small renal cysts with a diameter of 1 to 3.5 cm. verified by US or CAT were
investigated by 7-pinhole and planar scintigraphy. Eight of 12 renal cysts were
identified by 7-pinhole scintigraphy whereas only one cyst was seen by planar
scintigraphy. The borderline of cysts detection was 1.5 cm. in 7-pinhole
tomography. Basing on these comparative studies and experiences on many patient
investigations it seems reasonable to perform renal scintigraphy with 7-pinhole
tomography in a routine manner.

Radionuclide measurement of differential glomerular filtration rate in urinary
tract obstruction.

Powers TA, Stone WJ, Lowe BA, Patton JA, Bowen RD.

In a previous study using dogs whose renal function was rendered asymmetric by
unilateral infarction, the efficacy of technetium-99m (99mTc) DTPA and DMSA in
measuring differential glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was demonstrated. The
present study was undertaken to determine whether the same techniques were
applicable to unilateral ureteral obstruction. Five normal dogs and nine dogs
with partial unilateral ureteral obstruction had determination of glomerular
filtration rate by standard techniques using constant infusions of iothalamate
and creatinine after ureteral catheterization. These results were compared with
total GFR as measured by single injection of 99mTc DTPA and analysis of the
plasma disappearance curve. Calculated differential GFR was obtained by
multiplying total GFR from double exponential analysis of this curve (DTPA2) by
each of three measures of differential function. These included the percent
differential uptake of 99mTc DTPA and 99mTC DMSA in the posterior projection as
well as the geometric mean of 99mTc DMSA uptake. There were good correlations
between differential GFR determined by iothalamate clearances at ureteral
catheterization and all noninvasive methods involving radionuclides and DTPA2 ( r
= 0.93-0.99). Single exponential analysis of the 99mTc DTPA plasma disappearance 
curve was less satisfactory than double exponential analysis. These results and
those reported previously support the use of radionuclides in the determination
of differential GFR in a variety of clinical situations.

Nuclear medicine in acute and chronic renal failure.

Sherman RA, Byun KJ.

The diagnostic value of renal scintiscans in patients with acute or chronic renal
failure has not been emphasized other than for the estimation of renal size. 131I
OIH, 67gallium, 99mTcDTPA, glucoheptonate and DMSA all may be valuable in a
variety of specific settings. Acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis, 
hepatorenal syndrome, acute interstitial nephritis, cortical necrosis, renal
artery embolism, or acute pyelonephritis may be recognized. Data useful in the
diagnosis and management of the patient with obstructive or reflux nephropathy
may be obtained. Radionuclide studies in patients with chronic renal failure may 
help make apparent such causes as renal artery stenosis, chronic pyelonephritis
or lymphomatous kidney infiltration. Future correlation of scanning results with 
renal pathology promises to further expand nuclear medicine's utility in the
noninvasive diagnosis of renal disease.

Nuclear renal imaging in acute pyelonephritis.

Handmaker H.

Patients with acute pyelonephritis may present with a spectrum of clinical signs 
and symptoms. There are few noninvasive diagnostic studies, however, to confirm
or exclude this diagnosis. A small number of patients, generally those with
severe disease, will demonstrate radiographic changes on excretory urography, but
the lack of sensitivity of the IVP in early, acute pyelonephritis is well
documented. Several radionuclide techniques have been proposed to assist in the
earlier detection of this clinical problem including imaging with Mercury-197
chlormerodrin, Gallium-67 citrate, Technetium-99m glucoheptonate. Technetium-99m 
DMSA, and, more recently, Indium-111 labeled white blood cells. The success of
the renal cortical imaging agents as well as those which localize in infection
are described in this report. There appears to be a complimentary role or the
cortical imaging agents and the radiopharmaceuticals which localize in bacterial 
infection. Cortical agents offer the advantage of specific assessment of
functioning renal tissue and a convenient, rapid method for following the
response to treatment in a noninvasive manner. A pattern is described which may
be diagnostic; correlation with Gallium-67 citrate of Indium-111 WBCs may
increase the probability of infection as the cause for the cortical abnormality. 
The measurement of differential renal function using cortical agents provides
additional information to assist the clinician in predicting the late effects of 
infection. Improved sensitivity and specificity, and a reproducible method for
following the response to therapy in patients with acute pyelonephritis are the
advantages of the techniques described.

Renal radiopharmaceuticals--an update.

Chervu LR, Blaufox MD.

Noninvasive radionuclide procedures in the evaluation of renal disease have been 
accepted increasingly as effective and valuable alternatives to older clinical
methods. The development of suitable radiopharmaceuticals labeled with high
photon intensity radionuclides and with 99mTc in particular has stimulated this
modality during the last few years. Currently several nearly ideal agents are
available for anatomical and functional studies of kidney imparting very low
absorbed radiation doses. These include 99mTc-GHA and 99mTc-DMSA for renal
morphology and differential function evaluation, 99mTc-DTPA for GFR and 123I
orthoiodohippurate for ERPF measurements. A suitable agent as a replacement for
the latter labeled with 99mTc is actively being sought. Computer-assisted
processing of dynamic renal function studies enables the observer to obtain a
wealth of information related to the renal extraction, uptake, parenchymal
transit and pelvic transit parameters of the agent administered into the
bloodstream. Each of these parameters either globally or differentially
contributes to a detailed evaluation of renal disease states. Several of these
procedures have been validated against classical techniques clinically but more
detailed information is being sought with the recently introduced
radiopharmaceuticals. With the detailed validation and increasing recognition of 
the clinical utility of several of the radionuclidic procedures at many centers, 
it is hoped that radionuclide assessment of renal disorders ultimately will be
made available routinely at all medical facilities.

Limitations of renal function scanning in acute obstruction.

Talner LB, Sokoloff J, Halpern SE, Taylor A Jr.

This study was designed to determine if technetium-99m penicillamine (TPEN),
could be used to predict recoverable function in dogs with acute obstruction.
Renal accumulation of TPEN was measured in four control dogs, in four dogs with
acute obstruction lasting 7-14 days, and in the same four dogs following a
variable recovery period of 15-63 days. The relative renal uptake of TPEN in vivo
showed good agreement with the relative uptake in vitro and both measurements
correlated closely with the relative inulin clearances in the normal and in the
post obstructed kidneys. The uptake of TPEN in the obstructed kidney following
7-14 days of obstruction averaged 6.8% of the total renal uptake. After relief of
the obstruction and a variable recovery period the relative uptake of TPEN in the
post obstructed kidney had increased to a mean of 29.5%. These results indicate
that TPEN scans should not be used during acute obstruction to predict
recoverable function. The observations noted in the study almost certainly apply 
to similar chelating agents such as dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and probably
to other renal radiopharmaceuticals as well.

The effects of dimercaptosuccinic acid and other chelating agents on the
retention of platinum in the rat kidney after treatment with cisplatin.

Planas-Bohne F, Shand E, Taylor DM.

The ability of three chelating agents, dimercaptopropanesulphonate (DMPS),
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DPTA), to
reduce the retention of platinum in the kidneys was tested in male Sprague-Dawley
rats treated 24 h previously with Cisplatin. DMPS and DMSA, when given as four
daily doses of 1 mMol/kg, increased the urinary excretion from 10.1% +/- 1.2% to 
13.6% +/- 1.3% and 13.5% +/- 2.6%, respectively, but only DMSA caused a small but
significant reduction in the kidney platinum content. DTPA was totally
ineffective. It is concluded that none of these agents is likely to be useful for
the reduction of Cisplatin-induced renal toxicity in the clinical situation.

Tc-99m DMSA renal uptake: influence of biochemical and physiologic factors.

Yee CA, Lee HB, Blaufox MD.

Thirty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were studied to determine the effects of 
(a) tubular blockade and (b) commonly encountered changes in hydration and
acid-base balance, on the urinary excretion and renal localization of Tc-99m
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). Ten additional rats were studied to quantitate
the in vivo protein binding of Tc-99m DMSA, and a final group of 12 animals was
used to quantitate DMSA distribution in animals with diminished functional renal 
mass. Both osmotic diuresis and dehydration by water deprivation for 24 hr
resulted in a plasma clearance of DMSA slower than in control animals. Acid-base 
imbalances significantly affected the renal accumulation of DMSA, and acidosis
was associated with markedly increased background due to increased liver
accumulation. The protein-bound portion of Tc-99m DMSA in the plasma was high,
reaching 89% within the first 5 min, and rising very slightly (n.s.) ith time.
The unbound portion of DMSA had a plasma clearance slightly higher than the GFR. 
Ablation of large amounts of renal tissue, resulting in significant decreases in 
GFR. Ablation of large amounts of renal tissue, resulting in significant
decreases in GFR, did not significantly affect the renal localization of DMSA in 
the intact portions of the kidneys. These data demonstrate that commonly
encountered changes in acid-base balance and hydration will significantly alter
the biologic distribution of Tc-99m DMSA. These factors should be controlled when
carrying out clinical studies.

Influence of certain chelating agents on egress of cadmium from cultured
epithelial cells containing high amounts of metallothionein: a screening of
Cd-releasing and toxic effects.

Bakka A, Aaseth J, Rugstad HE.

Cells cultures have been used to study the effect of 6 different metal chelating 
compounds on the efflux of Cadmium (Cd) from the cells and on cell growth. The
cells had previously been made resistant to high levels of Cd (100 mumol/1) in
the medium. They contain large amounts of intracellular Cd (40-50 nmol Cd/mg cell
protein), the main part of which is bound to cytoplasmic metallothionein. Among
the different monothiol and dithiol compounds tested are some old, well-known and
to some extent therapeutically tried substances, i.e. 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol
(BAL), D-penicillamine (PA), N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (NAPA) and some newer
metal chelators, i.e. 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulphonate (BAL-Sulph),
mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The
three latter ones all showed better effect on the egress of Cd than PA and NAPA
and less toxic effect than BAL on an equimolar basis. All the agents tested
increased the efflux of Cd from metallothionein-containing cell cultures which
seem to be justified as a test system for primary screening of effect and
toxicity of new chelators.

[Atraumatic microsurgical nephrotomy. Experimental study on canine kidney
(author's transl)].

[Article in French]

Chopin D, Abbou CC, Leandri J, Moretti JL, Auvert J.

Microsurgical transversal section and repair of canine kidney was presented as a 
model to study the condition required for an atraumatic nephrotomy. The
investigation was carried out by two methods. In a first series five kidneys were
injected by coloured resins after transection and microsurgical repair. Results
were evaluated by cast examination of vascular net work. In a second series,
transection and repair were made by an "ex-situ" procedure on seven dogs. The
repaired kidney was autotransplanted in the opposite fossa iliaca. Long term
renal function was evaluated after controlateral nephrectomy, by arteriography,
biologic data and DMSA Tc 99 m scintiscan. The good results showed that
microsurgery is useful in atraumatic nephrotomy and now a new tool in intrarenal 
access.

97Ru-DMSA for delayed renal imaging.

Oster ZH, Som P, Gil MC, Goldman AG, Fairchild RG, Meinken GE, Srivastava SC,
Atkins HL, Richards P, Brill AB.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was labeled with 97Ru both with and without the
addition of SnCl.2H2O. The tin-containing preparation was found to induce higher 
cortical deposition of 97Ru-DMSA than the tin-free preparation. Visualization of 
the renal cortex was excellent 4 to 48 hours after injection in normal dogs with 
renal insufficiency. It is concluded that 97Ru-(Sn+2)-DMSA is a potentially
useful renal imaging agent when delayed scintigraphy is necessary because of
decompensaton of the kidneys.

(1)Toxicology Research Unit, Medical Research Council of New Zealand, University 
of Otago Medical School, Dunedin, New Zealand.

The effect of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) on the tissue distribution, renal
and hepatic subcellular localization of Cd2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+ in Cd(2+)-pretreated 
male rats and on the tissue distribution of Zn2+ and Cu2+ in the normal rat was
studied. Cd(2+)-pretreated rats which received 3 x 1 mg Cd2+/kg body wt s.c. at
48 hr intervals followed after 7 days by DMSA (50 mg/kg body wt i.p.) daily for
17 days had total hepatic Cd2+ concentrations 25 per cent lower than
Cd(2+)-pretreated controls (P < 0.01). DMSA did not influence the concentration
or distribution of Cd2+ in the liver cytosol whereas in the
mitochondrial-lysosomal and nuclei + cell debris fractions the Cd2+ concentration
was reduced by 54 and 48 per cent respectively. Total renal and hepatic Cu2+
concentrations were increased by Cd2+ treatment and reduced by treatment of the
Cd(2+)-exposed animal with DMSA. In the liver cytosol Cu2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+
accumulated in the metallothionein fraction and none was mobilized from the
cytosol by DMSA. In the kidney cytosol Cu2+ accumulated in fractions in addition 
to metallothionein and was eliminated from each of these fractions following
treatment with DMSA. It is concluded that the high affinity of metallothionein
for these cations prevented their elimination from the cytosol and that the
interaction of Cd2+ and Cu2+ with DMSA occurred in the particulate fraction and
therefore delayed the response to DMSA treatment. It is suggested that long term 
treatment with DMSA, although ineffective in mobilizing Cd2+ from the kidney may 
provide a useful therapeutic measure to reduce the liver burden of Cd2+ and the
high renal Cu2+ concentrations in the Cd(2+)-exposed animal.

Evaluation of methyl mercury chelating agents using red blood cells and isolated 
hepatocytes.

Aaseth J, Alexander J, Deverill J.

The relative efficacy of thiol-containing mercurial scavengers was assayed by
using cellular suspensions of erythrocytes or isolated hepatocytes. The blood
cells incubated in a buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM glucose (10% hematocrit)
were exposed to 5 microM methyl mercuric chloride. In the absence of
extracellular thiols the red blood cells took up more than 90% of methyl mercury 
from the surrounding medium during 5--10 min. This uptake was almost completely
inhibited by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) (1 mM) and the same chelant could
rapidly remove 80% of the mercury from 'pre-loaded' erythrocytes. Hepatocytes
prepared according to the method of Seglen [11] in a suspension of 10(6) cells/ml
in a buffer containing 5 mM glucose and 5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin were also
exposed to methyl mercuric chloride (4 microM). Almost 50% of the mercurial was
taken up by the cells slowly during the incubation period of 240 min. DMSA (1 mM)
almost completely blocked the methyl mercury binding by the hepatocytes.
2-Mercaptopropionylglycin (Thiola) or mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) was almost as
effective mercurial scavengers as DMSA in hepatocytes and in red blood cells.
Diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) and dimercaptopropanol (BAL) were considerably less 
effective than DMSA to inhibit the mercurial binding to hepatocytes. Experiments 
in vivo have shown that DMSA is a better mercurial chelator than Thiola or MSA,
whereas DDC and BAL may both be considered to be inapplicable in methyl mercury
poisonings. Our cellular assay provides preliminary information of the efficiency
of chelating thiols and may serve as a useful first approximation when planning
further experiments.

The influence of chelating agents on the distribution and biotransformation of
methylmercuric chloride in rats.

Planas-Bohne F.

Male albino rats were injected i.p. with [203Hg]methylmercuric chloride (MMC) and
later at different time intervals they received N-acetylpenicillamine,
2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate or dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The animals 
were sacrificed 24 h after the last chelant treatment and the content of 203Hg
was determined in 10 organs. In liver and kidneys, [203Hg]MMC and 203Hg++ were
measured separately. DMSA was most effective in removing the mercurial from all
organs, except the kidneys, where 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate was better.
N-acetylpenicillamine showed only marginal effectiveness. Separate determinations
of [203Hg]MMC and 203Hg++ in liver and kidneys showed that DMSA removed more of
the organic and 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate more of the inorganic Hg. DMSA 
injected i.p. or given p.o. removed almost equal amounts of MMC, indicating
virtually 100% absorption of the chelating agent from the gastrointestinal tract.

Contribution to the functional assessment of individual kidneys (author's

[Article in French]

Abbou CC, Moretti JL, Chopin D, Sanabria E, Msallag M, Nebout T, Auvert J.

Renal uptake of 99m Tc DMSA was used to evaluate the renal function of 16 healthy
subjects (controls) and 115 patients with various urinary tract diseases.
Scintigraphic examination was carried out 6 hours after an intravenous injection 
of the product. In the 16 controls Tc DMSA uptake was 25.7 +/- 2.48% in the right
kidney and 24.4 +/- 2.86% in the left kidney. In 36 patients with one single
hypertrophied kidney, there was a correlation (r = 0.850) between creatinine
clearance and Tc DMSA uptake, which was higher than in normal subjects (39.23 +/-
9.9%). In the group of 68 patients with unilateral (31) or bilateral (37) renal
disease, a significant correlation (r = 0,725) was observed between
kidney-to-kidney ratios of urea clearance and Tc DMSA uptake, so that renal
impairment could be quantified. Quantitative scintigraphy did not appear to be of
assistance in the remaining 11 patients with obstructive uropathy, as it
overestimated renal function. The results obtained with 99 m Tc DMSA scintigraphy
should be helpful in choosing between nephrectomy and conservative surgery and in
assessing the degree of compensatory hypertrophy in single kidneys.

Sztriha L, Pusztay G, Beviz J.

Experiences are reported on renal imaging with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(DMSA) in pediatric nephrology. Because of its low radiation dose, the use of
99mTc-DMSA has advantages in infancy and childhood, while the considerable
accumulation of this compound in the renal cortex results in more informative
imaging than with other 99mTc-complexes. Not only can the shape, size and
position of the kidneys, and the location and extent of renal tumors, cysts and
abscesses be visualized, but as a complement to excretory urography this
technique contributes even in pyelonephritis to the precise determination of
parenchymal damage.

the myocardial depletion of creatine kinase. Myocardial Tc-99m DMSA was

Addarii F.

The authors report the first data relating to their research carried out with the
intention of showing the possible correlations between pathological kidney
movement and so-called essential hypertension. The study of the kidneys has been 
carried out with 99mTc-DMSA, using multiple projections both in upright and prone
positions. Furthermore, the appropriate renogram has been carried out for each
patient. In the light of the obtained data the AA. point that in the majority of 
hypertensive patients personally examined (80.5%) there was a pathological renal 
movement, most often bilateral (22%) or affecting the right kidney (17.1%), with 
which variations were often associated, especially in the second stage of the
renograph. The authors underline the importance of this type of investigation,
which will be further extended by the associated use of 99mTc-Ca-Glucoheptonate.

Radionuclide measurement of differential glomerular filtration rate.

Powers TA, Stone WJ, Grove RB, Plunkett JM, Kadir S, Patton JA, Bowen RD.

The authors sought to determine whether radionuclides could provide a reasonable 
estimate of differential renal function in five normal dogs and six dogs with
unilateral segmental renal infarction. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of each
kidney was measured by the standard technique using constant infusions of
99mTc-DTPA, iothalamate, and creatinine following ureteral catheterization. These
results were correlated with total GFR estimated by bolus injection of 99mTc-DTPA
and analysis of the plasma 99mTc-DTPA disappearance curve obtained by blood
sampling. Differential GFR was then calculated by multiplying the total GFR from 
double exponential analysis of this curve (DTPA2) by each of three measures of
differential function. These include the percent differential uptake of
99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-DMSA in the posterior projection as well as the geometric
mean of 99mTc-DMSA uptake. There were good correlations between differential GFR 
calculated from iothalamate clearances obtained at ureteral catheterization and
all noninvasive methods involving radionuclides and DTPA2 (r = 0.85 - 0.99).
Single exponential analysis of the 99mTc-DTPA plasma disappearance curve was less
satisfactory. The authors suggest that measurement of total and differential GFR 
calculated from plasma clearance of 99mTc-DTPA and external counting may be a
useful method with potential clinical applications.

Effects of obstruction on single-kidney function: clinical and experimental
results with 131I-hippurate and 99mTc-DMSA.

Moser E, Jocham D, Beer M, Büll U.

In 35 patients, renography with 131I-o-hippurate (OIH) and static renal imaging
with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were used to measure differential renal
function (DRF). The results were compared. Depth correction was applied in both
methods. In non-obstructed kidneys (19 patients), both methods revealed nearly
identical kidney function (r = 0.98). For completely obstructed kidneys (16
patients), OIH gave a significantly better DRF (14 ml/min) than DMSA. This small 
difference was of no clinical value. Because DMSA is reported to give unreliable 
results in unilateral obstructed kidneys, the right ureter was ligated in 8 dogs 
for 10 days and DRF was measured before and after opening an ureteral fistula.
The difference in DRF was about 1% and could be accounted for by the amount of
urinary radioactivity collected from the pelvic system after the ligature had
been opened. Although DMSA appears to give reliable values in determining DRF,
even in obstructed kidneys, OIH is preferred since total clearance values and
postrenal urinary dynamics can be determined simultaneously.

Optimal handling of dimercaptosuccinic acid for quantitative renal scanning.

Taylor A Jr, Lallone RL, Hagan PL.

Methods of optimizing quantitative renal imaging with Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DSMA) were investigated. Rats were injected with DMSA (one kit per rat) and
sacrificed at 0.5, 2.0, and 24 hr after injection. Fifty percent of the injected 
dose localized in the kidneys at 0.5, 2, and 24 hr after injection while
background activity peaked at 0.5 hr and then declined to give substantially
higher kidney-to-background ratios at 24 hr. Delayed scanning should increase the
accuracy of clinical studies in patients with low kidney-to-background ratios at 
1-2 hr. After injection of DMSA, 1 ml of air was introduced into the reaction
vials and incubated 20 min. Kidney uptake decreased from 50 to 40% and liver
uptake increased from 7.5 to 17%. If multiple doses must be drawn from a single
vial, air should not be introduced, and the doses should be drawn together and
administered immediately to minimize radiopharmaceutical deterioration.

Ureteric ectopy in children.

Gill B.

Twenty-eight cases of ectopic ureters are reviewed. Two groups consisting of
single ectopic ureters and ectopia associated with duplex systems are considered.
The former is associated with a high incidence of congenital anomalies. A dilated
ectopic ureter remains completely extravesical but can produce features closely
resembling those of an ectopic ureterocele. The use of 99mTc-DMSA renal scan has 
proved helpful in the diagnosis of the condition because it can demonstrate the
existence of a poorly functioning kidney not evident on excretion urography.

Delayed scanning with DMSA: a simple index of relative renal plasma flow.

Taylor A Jr.

Relative renal uptake of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was compared with
the relative effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) to each kidney. In 25 patients
with serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl, there was excellent
agreement when the regions of interest were assigned by a computer. In 10
patients with serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dl, agreement was poor. A
24-hour image is sufficient to obtain such data. In patients with renal failure, 
this technique may give inaccurate results due to high tissue background
activity; moreover, since it reflects the current functioning status of the
kidney, it should not be used to predict recoverable function in patients with
acute or unstable renal disease.

Comparison of standard chelating agents for acute mercuric chloride poisoning in 
mice.

Jones MM, Basinger MA, Weaver AD, Davis CM, Vaughn WK.

A comparison in mice has been made of the effectiveness of five chelating agents 
used clinically for acute mercuric chloride poisoning, or recommended for such
use. The compounds examined were N-Acetyl-D,L-penicillamine (NAPA),
D-penicillamine (DPA), 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), sodium
2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS), and 2,3-dimercaptopropanol-1 (BAL). The
test of effectiveness was their ability to reduce the mortality of acute mercuric
chloride poisoning when administered 20 minutes after the mercury at
chelate:mercury mole ratios of 10, 15, 20, and 30. All except BAL were found to
be effective at the highest mole ratio tested, but N-Acetyl-D,L-penicillamine and
sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonate were significantly more effective than DMSA
and BAL at mole ratios of 10:1. The relative effectiveness does not correlate
with available data on stability constants. The toxicity of BAL itself becomes
apparent at mole ratios of 20:1 and above.

[Enhancement of 67Ga tumor-to-blood ratios by chelating agent (author's transl)].

[Article in Japanese]

Saji H, Yokoyama A, Hata N, Misaki A, Tanaka H, Morita R, Fukunaga M, Torizuka K.

Chelating agent, such as CaEDTA, CaDTPA, D-penicillamine, DMSA, desferoxamine,
NTA, cysteine ethyl ester, BAL, alpha-MPG, phthalein complexone, were tested as a
possible contrast enhancing agent for tumor imaging with 67Ga-citrate. The
intravenous administration of a chelating agent to Ehrlich's tumor bearing mice, 
one hour after the injection of 67Ga-citrate, accelerated the blood clearance
with only a very slight change of activity in the target, increasing the
tumor-to-blood ratio, and consequently achieving a better visualization. Among
the tested chelating agents, D-penicillamine showed the highest
target-to-nontarget ratio at a shorter time: a good tumor-to-blood ratio,
performed after 24 hr with non-treated animals, was achieved in only 1-3 hr with 
post-treated animals. Thus, D-penicillamine hold a considerable promise as a
contrast enhancing agent for future clinical use.

A simple method of predicting progression of polycystic kidney disease by
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy.

Kawamura J, Ito H, Sawanishi K, Yoshida O.

Renal scintigraphy with 99Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) was used to determine
the prognosis of patients with adult polycystic kidney disease. In 40 patients,
DMSA renal uptake rate, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were
examined in different periods, at least twice a year. These parameters were
plotted on semilogarithmic paper against the course of observation period (years 
or months in duration). As the impairment of renal function progresses, these
parameters gradually worsen, DMSA renal uptake decreases and serum creatinine and
BUN elevate linearly. In the terminal stage when hemodialysis is required, total 
DMSA uptake decreased to less than 1%, and this paralleled the levels of 100
mg/dl of BUN and 10 mg/dl of serum creatinine. Accordingly, when linear lines of 
parameters are extended to those levels obtained in hemodialysis patients, the
years and months which coincide on the abscissa can be accounted for when
initiation of the hemodialysis is taken into consideration. Analysis of this
linear relation in individual patients allows for an estimate of the progression 
of this disease and may assist in the determination of the effects of
conservative treatment. This method also indicates that the level of DMSA uptake 
at the initial diagnosis is a critical factor in assessing the prognosis of the
patient.

[Evaluation of unilateral renal function in urinary obstruction. A comparison of 
various radioisotope methods (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Creutzig H, Schindler E, Reuter TD, Fröhlich D.

The catheter-free determination of the unilateral 131I-hippuran clearance
correlates well with the unilateral clearance determination with 99mTc-DMSA in
patients without obstruction. In patients with unilateral chronic obstruction the
clearance of 131I-hippuran on the average is 13% higher than the clearance
determined by the DMSA method. After successful correction of the obstruction the
two values are identical. 123I-hippuran is foundin the renal pelvis already after
90 seconds in some cases of marked chronic obstruction. The functioning part of
the involved kidney is therefore possibly overestimated whereas the DMSA uptake
reflects the actual function. Both radioisotope methods should be applied
preoperatively in order to evaluate the individual renal function. Functional
scintigraphy in patients with obstruction should preferably be carried out with
123I-hippuran.

Renal hyperconcentration of 99mTc-HEDP in experimental acute tubular necrosis.

Lavelle KJ, Park HM, Moseman AM, Lewis S.

The effect of transient renal ischemia on renal concentration and distribution of
99mTc-HEDP, 99mTc-DMSA, and 99mTc-DTPA was compared in rabbits with acute tubular
necrosis. Scintigrams were obtained after injection in normal rabbits or ones
with unilateral or bilateral ischemia. 99mTc-HEDP concentration in ischemic
tissue was 8 to 18 times normal 1--4 hours after injection, and the resulting
images delineated the morphological changes in the ischemic kidneys more
accurately than those obtained with DMSA or DTPA. Calcium concentration in the
ischemic kidneys increased sixfold. 99mTc-HEDP may be useful in evaluation of
renal failure secondary to tubular injury.

Successful visualization of cortical malignant lesions on renal scintigram using 
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Kawamura J, Hosokawa S, Yoshida O, Fujita T, Torizuka K.

The early (dynamic) and late (static) renal images obtained with
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) were utilized to evaluate renal cortical
malignant tumors in 30 cases of renal cell carcinoma each of which had been
confirmed by operation or autopsy. Early images, performed 20--50 seconds after
radionuclide administration, demonstrated abnormal vascular pools in the cortex. 
A cold area without DMSA uptake was demonstrated on the 2-hour or late images,
reflecting a non-functioning renal mass. Lesions demonstrated with combined early
and late images showed a good correlation with those demonstrated by renal
angiography in 25 out of 27 cases. However, when almost all the renal tumor was
replaced by necrotic lesions, the early image did not reveal hypervascularity.
When a highly vascular renal tumor extended to the perinephric tissues, the tumor
area was sometimes overestimated on the early image. It is almost impossible to
diagnose renal cell carcinoma using radionuclide imaging alone. However,
99mTc-DMSA renal studies, using both early and late imaging, have proven to be a 
useful, noninvasive adjunct in the detection of malignant cortical lesions.

Kidney scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA and 131I-hippurate.

Holten I, Storm HH.

43 patients underwent an extended scintigraphic procedure with
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinylic acid in order to investigate its proper use for
diagnosing morphological and functional kidney abnormalities. The group was
comprised of patients without renal disease, and patients with diffuse
parenchymal disease, obstructive uropathy, renal cysts and renal tumors. The
study was followed by 131I-hippurate renography. We propose a simplified routine 
procedure with scintiphotos taken 10-15 min after injection for topographic
information and 120 min after injection for renal morphology. This procedure
allows excellent case finding of diffuse parenchymal disease of a special value
in cases of radiological non-visualization. The technique is indicated, when
iodine contrast media cannot be used for radiological examinations. DMSA studies,
however, do not allow safe functional evaluation in all categories of patients.
Neither can obstructive nephropathy be diagnosed unless the renal pelvis is
dilated. Renal perfusion studies are contaminated by the perfusion of liver and
spleen. Nevertheless, a tentative differentiation between cysts and tumours is
possible, the former being hypoperfused the latter hyperperfused. When
supplemented with gamma camera 131I-hippurate renography, the total scintigraphic
procedure will also include split function determination and run-off evaluation.

Renal function studies using 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid.

Kawamura J, Hosokawa S, Yoshida O.

99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), provides both a well defined renal image
via preferential cortical accumulation, and a quantitative assessment of separate
kidney function, correlating well with renal plasma flow obtained from the
131I-Hippuran renogram of each kidney. 99mTc-DMSA is capable of labeling the
functioning nephrons in the cortex without interference by the activity of urine 
flow, suggesting that DMSA should be termed a cortical tubular marker. 99mTc-DMSA
scintigraphy has advantages over conventional methods in that it can be performed
repeatedly with little discomfort to the patients, as a routine clinical
examination.

The relative effectiveness of some chelating agents as antidotes in acute cadmium
poisoning.

Jones MM, Weaver AD, Weller WL.

An examination has been made of the relative effectiveness of three chelating
agents in reducing lethality in acute cadmium poisoning. The chelating agents
used were sodium 2,3 dimercaptosulfonate (DMPS), N-Acetyl d,1 penicillamine
(NAPA), and 2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). For cadmium acetate administered 
ip at a level of 16.9 mg/kg, the oral administration of the chelating agents at a
20:1 mole ratio in three doses subsequent to the cadmium acetate at 20 minutes,
90 minutes, and 210 minutes resulted in a significant enhancement of the survival
rate for all three compounds. At this level none of the control animals survived 
beyond 2 days. On the basis of the experiments carried out here the survival
rates decreased in the order sodium 2,3 dimercaptopropane-sulfonate greater than 
2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid greater than N-Acetyl d,l penicillamine. In a study
of the effect of the mole ratio of the chelating agent sodium 2,3
dimercaptopropanesulfonate to cadmium acetate on the survival rate, it was found 
that the survival rate attained a maximum for values between 20 and 60 and
dropped off at both higher and lower values. It was also found that for at least 
one set of conditions, younger animals were better able to survive the
administration of cadmium acetate and the antidote than older animals.

Reduction of methylmercury concentration in neonatal rat brains after
administration of dimercaptosuccinic acid to dams while pregnant.

Hughes JA, Sparber SB.

Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged on day 7 of gestation with 1.62, 3.23 or 10 mg
methylmercury/kg. Beginning one day later, the dams were administered 0, 20 or 40
mg 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid/kg/day until they delivered their pups.
Concentrations of methylmercury in the brains of pups whose dams were treated
with 20 mg DMSA/kg/day were reduced 50% compared with control pups. 40 mg
DMSA/kg/day decreased brain concentrations 70% compared to non-chelated controls.
The data indicate that DMSA might be effective in protecting the developing
organism against morphological and/or behavioral teratological consequences of
methylmercury poisoning in utero.

(posterior length) averaged 11.5 +/- 1 cm, and renal radioactivity (functioning
tubular mass) was equally divided between the left and right kidney. 99mTc-DMSA

An evaluation of the use of 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) as a static
renal imaging agent.

Bingham JB, Maisey MN.

The clinical value of 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid, utilized as a static renal
imaging agent, has been analysed in 366 patients. It proved to be diagnostically 
most useful in space occupying lesions of the kidney when equivocal on IVU and
provided useful additional information when used in the determination of divided 
renal function or the distribution of intrarenal function. Its use is
contraindicated in the determination of divided renal function in obstructed
kidneys because of accumulation of significant amounts of DMSA that are excreted 
by glomerular filtration. When DMSA uptake at three hours after injection is
compared with 99Tcm-DPTA uptake from 90 to 150 seconds after bolus injection,
there is a good correlation between the two methods of determination of divided
renal function.

Use of 99Tcm-DMSA as a static renal imaging agent.

Bingham JB, Maisey MN, Joyce MR, Saxton HM.

The use of 99Tcm-labelled DMSA as a static renal imaging agent has been analyzed 
semi-quantitatively in 366 patients. Study with this agent proved to be of most
value in patients with equivocal space-occupying lesions of the kidney, provided 
useful information in various destructive diseases of the kidney when used for
determining divided renal function but was of little value in chronic renal
failure. In 33 patients, the uptake of 99Tcm-DMSA at 3 h as a measure of divided 
renal function was compared with the uptake of 99Tcm-DTPA from 30 to 150 sec
following injection and was found to correlate well. In a series of 7 dogs with
induced unilateral renal impairment, divided function determined with 99Tcm-DMSA 
was found to correlate well with results obtained using 51Cr-EDTA.

Rapid miniaturized chromatographic quality-control procedures for Tc-99m
radiopharmaceuticals.

Zimmer AM, Pavel DG.

Our laboratory has adopted a complete miniaturized charomatography system for
Tc-99m radiopharmaceuticals in order to improve upon the commercial systems
currently available. Three distinct, separate, chromatographic procedures are
used to determine the labeling efficiencies of Tc-99m-labeled sulfur colloid,
MAA, stannous chloride, phytate, DMSA, DTPA, pyrophosphate, diphosphonate,
methylene diphosphonate, polyphosphate, and glucoheptonate. The chromatographic
systems include Whatman 31 ET paper and acetone, Gelman ITLC-SG and 0.9% sodium
chloride, and Gelman ITLC-SA and acetone. The chromatographic strips are
miniaturized (1 X 6 cm), colored-coded, marked, and numbered. All the
chromatographic quality-control procedures are simple, rapid, and can easily be
incorporated into the routine quality-control program of any nuclear medicine
facility.

Serial macroautoradiograms were obtained to determine the distribution of
203Hg-chlormerodrin, 203Hg-nigrate and 99mTc-DMSA in kidney. In the study, normal
rats were used and these three radiopharmaceuticals were injected intravenously. 
Initial images of 203Hg-chlormerodrin showed the accumulation in the outer
cortex, but no significant radioactivity in the medullary. On the other hand,
delayed images revealed radioactivity shifting in concentration from the outer
cortex to the inner cortex. Distribution pattern of 203Hg-nitrate was similar to 
that of 203Hg-chlormerodrin. In contrast to 203Hg-chlormerodrin and
203Hg-nitrate, 99mTc-DMSA was retained in the outer cortex without temporal
changes in the distribution.

[Article in German]

Mariss P, Thiede G.

Hg-Cl2-accumulation and early hippuran uptake are widely used for the estimation 
of individual renal function, a clinically important procedure in
nephrological-urological nuclear medicine. After clinical experience in more than
2500 patients we investigated the assessment of individual renal function by the 
uptake of Tc-DMSA, a new radiopharmaceutical for renal scintigraphy.
Tc-DMSA-uptake was measured after application of 0.8-1.6 mCi Tc-99m-DMSA by a
scintillation camera connected to a computer system and by a rectilinear scanner 
with data storage, additionally hippuran kinetics were registered with a
scintillation camera, the total body clearance was performed due to the method of
Oberhausen with a modified whole body counter. A good agreement and high
correlation between Tc-DMSA-uptake with background corection and the unilateral
renal clearance could be established. This easily available and clinically
valuable method also can be adjusted to institutions with a rather simple
equipment.

The authors have examined the tumor affinity of various 99mTc-labelled
radiopharmaceuticals to Ehrlich's tumor for the purpose of delineating positively
human malignant neoplasm. This paper includes biologic distributions of
99mTc-Sn-diphosphonate (99mTc-EHDP), 99mTc-Sn-dimercaptosuccinic acid
(99mTc-DMSA) and 99mTc-Sn-diethyl stilbestrol diphosphate (99mTc-DSDP,
99mTc-Honvan) as the second report on the tumor affinity to the Ehrlich-bearing
mice. (a) Tumor concentration of 99mTc-EHDP was lowest and the positive
delineation of implanted tumor with 99mTc-EHDP was poorest in sequential images, 
though the active accumulation to some soft tissue maglinant neoplasms, the
breast cancer and the thyroid cancer, has been reported. (b) Tumor concentration 
and tumor to blood ratio of 99mTc-DMSA were not so high on the contrary of our
expectation that 197Hg-DMSA may show the high tumor concentration and the high
tumor to blood ratio like 197Hg chlormerodrin as same renal scanning
radiopharmaceuticals. (c) Tumor concentration of 99mTc-DSDP was highest. Tumor to
blood concentration ratio, however, was lower than that of the above mentioned
radiopharmaceuticals but tumor to liver ratio and/or tumor to lung ratio was over
1.0 at the earlier time. Biologic distribution of 99mTc-DSDP was similar to that 
of 32P labeled DSDP and then it is presumed that 99mTc is labeled at phosphate
ester of DSDP which is dephospholytated immediately by phospholylase in vivo
following the intravenous injection. Therefore, it may be assumed that the
accumulation mechanism of 99mTc-DSDP to Ehrlich's tumor is related to the
phospholylase activity in neoplasms but is not known precisely.

The effects of dimercaptosuccinic acid on the excretion and distribution of
mercury in rats and mice treated with mercuric chloride and methylmercury
chloride.

Magos L.

1 All five rats in a group survived if dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), a water
soluble derivative of 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (BAL), was given in doses of 10-40
mg/kg intraperitoneally 30 min, 4 and 24 h after administration of 2.4 mg/kg Hg
as HgCl2, whereas three out of a group of five died if DMSA was not given. DMSA
20 mg/kg increased urinary excretion and decreased the body burden significantly 
more than 10 mg/kg DMSA, but further doubling of the dose had only marginal
effects. 2 DMSA was able to reduce body burden and increase urinary excretion of 
Hg when intraperitoneal treatment started eight days after the subcutaneous
administration of HgCl2. 3 DMSA was effective in decreasing body burden and the
brain concentration of Hg in rats dosed orally with methylmercury (MeHgCl) when
intraperitoneal treatment started with 40 mg/kg DMSA 24 h after Hg. Increase in
the urinary excretion of mercury was responsible for the decrease in body burden.
4 DMSA was effective when given in the drinking water of rats or mice both
against inorganic Hg and MeHgCl. In mice treated intraperitoneally with MeHgCl,
DMSA 19.5 mug/ml in the drinking water caused a significant decrease in the body 
burden and increase in the excretion of Hg. 5 DMSA was about four times more
efficient than D-penicillamine in decreasing the body burden of Hg. As their
toxicity is in the same range, the higher efficiency of DMSA offers a larger
margin of safety for the mobilization of Hg.

Clinical experience with 99mTc-DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid), a new
renal-imaging agent.

Handmaker H, Young BW, Lowenstein JM.

Results are reported from the clinical evaluation of a new radiopharmaceutical
for renal imaging, 99mTc-DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid). Sixty-five patients were
studied and six of these patients' scintiphotos are illustrated. The physical
characteristics of 99mTc and the mercurial-like kinetics of the chelate produced 
high-resolution scintiphotos of the renal parenchyma in patients of all ages and 
with a variety of disease entities. The commercial availability of the material
in kit form permits its usage in all nuclear medicine facilities.
