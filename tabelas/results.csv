Kidney Int Rep,Elucidation of Renal Scars in Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux Using Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound: A Pilot Study.,Vesicoureteral reflux is a common disorder in children but can result in kidney scarring following acute pyelonephritis. The gold standard diagnostic to detect renal scars in children is (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. DMSA has a number of limitations including radiation exposure, need for sedation, and radiotracer supply shortages. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a technique whereby biocompatible microspheres of inert gas are administered i.v. that reflect ultrasonography sound waves and do not involve radiation. Because the contrast agent is rapidly cleared, contrast images must be obtained within minutes of administration. CEUS has been used in a variety of organ systems, but its use in pediatric kidney diseases is limited.</AbstractText>: Vesicoureteral reflux is a common disorder in children but can result in kidney scarring following acute pyelonephritis.

Clin Kidney J,Usefulness of (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan in the diagnosis and follow-up of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis in children.,BACKGROUND: Symptoms and signs of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) are nonspecific; therefore, renal biopsy is often necessary to clarify the diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in the diagnosis and follow-up of ATIN.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of five patients (nine renal units) with a median age of 14 years who underwent DMSA scan after a clinical and/or biopsy-proven diagnosis of ATIN. The exam was performed within 1 month after disease onset and repeated at a median time of 12 months after the acute phase.RESULTS: DMSA renal scans performed during the acute phase allowed the discovery of suggestive findings, including diffuse reduction of the renal uptake of radionuclide and presence of multiple 'cold' focal lesions in a corticomedullary distribution. The follow-up scintigraphy resulted normal in two patients who were treated with steroids and in one patient who presented a mild renal dysfunction in the acute phase. By contrast, the control scan showed persistent renal damage in one patient who was further readmitted because of hypertension and in one renal transplanted patient who presented a Stage 3 acute kidney injury in the acute phase.CONCLUSIONS: DMSA renal scan might be a reliable tool for an early non-invasive diagnosis of ATIN in children and might be particularly useful in those patients who are not candidates for a kidney biopsy. Moreover, DMSA scan gives accurate follow-up evaluation, as it allows monitoring of the evolution of acute renal parenchymal inflammation with potential risk of renal scar formation. Due to the small sample size, our findings warrant further validation in a larger study.,28979776,2017
Pediatr Nephrol,Urinary tract infection in small children: the evolution of renal damage over time.,BACKGROUND: Our objective was to analyze the evolution of kidney damage over time in small children with urinary tract infection (UTI) and factors associated with progression of renal damage.METHODS: From a cohort of 1003 children &lt;2 years of age with first-time UTI, a retrospective analysis of 103 children was done. Children were selected because of renal damage at index (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy at least 3 months after UTI, and a late DMSA scan was performed after at least 2 years. Damage was classified as progression when there was a decline in differential renal function (DRF) by ≥4%, as regression when there was complete or partial resolution of uptake defects.RESULTS: Of 103 children, 20 showed progression, 20 regression, and 63 remained unchanged. There were no differences between groups regarding gender or age. In the progression group, 16/20 (80%) children had vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) grade III-V and 13 (65%) had recurrent UTI. In multivariable regression analysis, both VUR grade III-V and recurrent UTI were associated with progression. In the regression group, 16/20 (80%) had no VUR or grade I-II, and two (10%) had recurrent UTI.CONCLUSIONS: Most small children with febrile UTI do not develop renal damage and if they do the majority remain unchanged or regress over time. However, up to one-fifth of children with renal damage diagnosed after UTI are at risk of renal deterioration. These children are characterized by the presence of VUR grades III-V and recurrent febrile UTI and may benefit from follow-up.,28681079,2017
Clin Nucl Med,A Pediatric Case of Well-Functioning Supernumerary Kidney: Relative Renal Function Assessment Using Radionuclide Imaging.,We present an interesting image of a well-functioning supernumerary kidney evaluated with DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) renal scintigraphy in a 14-year-old girl. At 2 years of age, the patient had a diagnosis of supernumerary kidney. She remained asymptomatic up to childhood age, and then a DMSA study was required to guide the following adequate surveillance strategy. DMSA study provided a clear imaging of supernumerary kidney in the left side of the abdomen showing a regular uptake and a normal function in relation to its own size.,28650887,2017
Nucl Med Rev Cent East Eur,Usefulness of parametric renal clearance images in the assessment of basic risk factors for renalnal clearance images in the assessment of basic risk factors for renal scarring in children with recurrent urinary tract infections.,BACKGROUND: Clinically confirmed incidents of acute pyelonephritis (APN) following recurrent infections of urinary tract (UTI) form basic risk factors for renal scarring in children. Vesico-uretheral reflux (VUR) of higher grade is additional risk factor for this scarring. Opinions on diagnostic value of summed sequential images of renal uptake phase (SUM) of dynamic renal scintigraphy in detection of renal scars are diverse. However, several publications point to higher diagnostic efficacy of clearance parametric images (PAR) generated from this study.THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To establish a clinical value of parametric renal clearance images in detection of renal scarring.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was performed in a group of 91 children at the age of 4 to 18 years with recurrent UTI. Clinically documented incidents of APN were noted in 32 children: in 8 cases - one and in the remaining 24 - 2 to 5 (mean 3) incidents. In the remaining 59 patients only infections of the lower part of urinary tract were diagnosed. Static renal 99mTc-DMSA SPECT study and after 2-4 days dynamic renal studies (99mTc-EC) were performed in every patient not earlier than 6 months after the last documented incident of UTI. PAR images generated from a dynamic study by in-house developed software and SUM images were compared with a gold standard SPECT study.RESULTS: Percentages of children with detected renal scar(s) with SPECT and PAR methods amounted to 55% and 54%, respectively and were statistically significantly higher (p &lt; 0.0001) than with SUM method - 31%. Scars in children with history of APN detected with SPECT and PAR methods were significantly more frequent than with infections of only lower part of urinary tract (72% vs. 46%; p = 0.017 and 69% vs. 46%; p = 0.036, respectively). A SUM method did not reveal statistically significant differences between frequencies of detection of scars in groups specified above - 38% vs. 27% (p = 0.31). Both SPECT and PAR methods showed also that frequencies of occurrence of renal scars in children with higher grades of VUR were higher than without or with lower grades of VUR: 79% vs. 50% (p = 0.048) and 79% vs. 49% (p = 0.04). A SUM method did not reveal higher frequency of renal scars in children with high VUR grades: 36% vs. 30% (p = 0.44).CONCLUSION: Results obtained with PAR and SPECT methods were similar. An advantage of PAR over SUM images obtained from a dynamic renal scintigraphy in detection of renal scars in children with UTI was confirmed.,28555450,2017
Acta Inform Med,Interobserver Variability in Interpretation of Planar and SPECT Tc-99m-DMSA Renal Scintigraphy in Children.,OBJECTIVE: This study objective was to evaluate interobserver agreement between individual pairs of three nuclear medicine physicians in interpretation of renal cortical scintigraphy in children with respect to the mode of acquisition (planar vs. SPECT), diagnoses and kidney site (left vs. right).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty children were imaged in planar and SPECT mode per protocol upon the injection of Tc-99m DMSA dose adjusted to their body weight. Patients were classified according to diagnoses into four groups. Three nuclear medicine physicians interpreted the findings blindly and independently. Renal defects were interpreted as focal and diffuse, per three renal segments. For the raters we calculated simple percentage agreement, the Cohen kappa statistic with 95% confidence intervals, and the overall kappa defining the levels of reliability as almost perfect or perfect, substantial, moderate, fair and slight agreement.RESULTS: Interobserver agreement in planar interpretation was 77,2% (kappa=0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.75) and SPECT 72,9% (kappa= 0,57; 95% confidence interval, 0,41 to 0,72). In planar interpretation, all individual pairs had moderate agreements except one that had a substantial agreement. In SPECT, all the pairs had moderate agreements except one that had an almost perfect agreement. Overall agreement per kidney site was on planar 73,4% for the left (kappa=0,54, moderate agreement), and 81,1% for the right kidney (kappa 0,63, substantial agreement). On SPECT, there was 72,2% agreement for the left (kappa=0,59, mode rate agreement), and 73,7% for the right kidney (kappa=0,54, moderate agreement). Overall agreement per diagnoses ranged from 70-88,9% on planar (kappa= -0,04 to 0,79), and 50-100% on SPECT (kappa=-0,02-1,000) indicating agreements from slight to substantial.DISCUSSION: Our results suggest acceptable levels of interobserver agreement in all individual pairs of raters with respect to the mode of acquisition (planar vs. SPECT), diagnoses and kidney site (left vs. right). For the mode of acquisition, we would recommend hybrid imaging SPECT/CT method to be used whenever possible in the detection of renal cortical defects on Tc-99m-DMSA scintigraphy.,28484294,2017
Urologe A,[Urinary tract infections in children].,Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most common bacterial infections in children. The symptoms are not very specific and range from abdominal pain, poor feeding to nocturnal urinary incontinence. The technique of collecting urine plays an important role for securing the diagnosis. The best way to obtain urine in non-toilet-trained children is catheterization or suprapubic bladder aspiration. In toilet-trained children midstream urine is an acceptable alternative after cleaning the foreskin or labia. In the case of an infection a prompt empirical antibiotic therapy is necessary to reduce the risk of parenchymal scarring of the kidneys. There are different approaches to diagnose vesicoureteral reflux in different countries. The commonly used standard approach in Germany is voiding cystourethrography. In the case of reflux dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy should be performed additionally to exclude renal scarring (bottom-up approach).,28154883,2017
Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Dimercaptosuccinic acid scan or ultrasound in screening for vesicoureteral reflux among children with urinary tract infections.,BACKGROUND: There is considerable interest in detecting vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) because its presence, especially when severe, has been linked to an increased risk of urinary tract infections and renal scarring. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), also known as micturating cystourethrography, is the gold standard for the diagnosis of VUR, and the grading of its severity. Because VCUG requires bladder catheterisation and exposes children to radiation, there has been a growing interest in other screening strategies that could identify at-risk children without the risks and discomfort associated with VCUG.OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to evaluate the accuracy of two alternative imaging tests - the dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan (DMSA) and renal-bladder ultrasound (RBUS) - in diagnosing VUR and high-grade VUR (Grade III-V VUR).SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies from 1985 to 31 March 2016. The reference lists of relevant review articles were searched to identify additional studies not found through the electronic search.SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered published cross-sectional or cohort studies that compared the results of the index tests (DMSA scan or RBUS) with the results of radiographic VCUG in children less than 19 years of age with a culture-confirmed urinary tract infection.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently applied the selection criteria to all citations and independently abstracted data. We used the bivariate model to calculate summary sensitivity and specificity values.MAIN RESULTS: A total of 42 studies met our inclusion criteria. Twenty studies reported data on the test performance of RBUS in detecting VUR; the summary sensitivity and specificity estimates were 0.44 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.54) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.86), respectively. A total of 11 studies reported data on the test performance of RBUS in detecting high-grade VUR; the summary sensitivity and specificity estimates were 0.59 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.72) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.87), respectively. A total of 19 studies reported data on the test performance of DMSA in detecting VUR; the summary sensitivity and specificity estimates were 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.81) and 0.48 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.57), respectively. A total of 10 studies reported data on the accuracy of DMSA in detecting high-grade VUR. The summary sensitivity and specificity estimates were 0.93 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.98) and 0.44 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.56), respectively.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Neither the renal ultrasound nor the DMSA scan is accurate enough to detect VUR (of all grades). Although a child with a negative DMSA test has an &lt; 1% probability of having high-grade VUR, performing a screening DMSA will result in a large number of children falsely labelled as being at risk for high-grade VUR. Accordingly, the usefulness of the DMSA as a screening test for high-grade VUR should be questioned.,27378557,2016
J Surg Res,Cost and radiation exposure in the workup of febrile pediatric urinary tract infections.,BACKGROUND: Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans are often used in the evaluation of pediatric patients with febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs). Given the prevalence of febrile UTIs, we sought to quantify the cost, radiation exposure, and clinical utility of DMSA scans when compared with dedicated pediatric renal ultrasounds (RUSs).MATERIALS AND METHODS: An institutional review board approved retrospective study of children under the age of 18 years evaluated at our institution for febrile UTIs between the years 2004-2013 was conducted. The patients had to meet all of the following inclusion criteria: a diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux, a fever &gt;38°C, a positive urine culture, and evaluation with a DMSA scan and RUS. A chart review was used to construct a cost analysis of technical and professional fees, radiographic results, and radiation dose equivalents.RESULTS: Overall, 104 children met the inclusion criteria. A total of 122 RUS and 135 DMSA scans were performed. The technical costs of a DMSA scan incurred a 35% cost premium as compared to an RUS. The average effective radiation dose of a single DMSA scan was 2.84 mSv. New radiographic findings were only identified on 7% of those patients who underwent greater than 1 DMSA scan.CONCLUSIONS: The utility of the unique information acquired from a DMSA scan as compared to a RUS in the evaluation of febrile UTI must be evaluated on an individual case-by-case basis given the increased direct costs and radiation exposure to the patient.,27363638,2016
Minerva Urol Nefrol,Dimercaptosuccinic acid scan challenges in childhood urinary tract infection, vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring investigation and management.,Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a precipitating factor in acute pyelonephritis (APN), and a risk factor for renal scar formation, even if VUR and APN occur independently. There is no scientific evidence on a specific diagnostic evaluation of children after a febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). Based on recent literature and our clinical experience, we reviewed the role of 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in UTI/VUR imaging. We also reviewed the DMSA challenges and controversies in UTI/VUR management. A DMSA renal scan is the most reliable tool for the establishment of the diagnosis of APN during febrile UTIs acute phase. The &quot;top-down&quot; approach focuses on kidney involvement during UTI rather than on VUR existence, with a goal of diagnosing APN and/or renal dysplasia. Therefore, DMSA is performed before void cysteourethrography (VCUG). Late DMSA scanning should be performed to evaluate the presence of permanent renal scars. DMSA may be considered valuable in the follow-up of children with VUR, in order to detect new renal scarring after breakthrough or recurrent UTIs. An abnormal DMSA scan comprises a risk factor for VUR identification after UTI, for recurrent UTIs, renal damage/scarring, renal function deterioration, and a negative predictive risk factor for VUR improvement and/or spontaneous resolution. An individualized DMSA risk-based dynamic approach may assist physicians on VUR management decisions. DMSA could play an important role in selecting children with UTI/VUR who would benefit from close monitoring and/or early intervention. However, more data are needed for evidence-based guidelines.,27355216,2016
Open Access Maced J Med Sci,Vesicoureteral Reflux Detected with (99m)Tc-DTPA Renal Scintigraphy during Evaluation of Renal Function.,BACKGROUND: Radionuclide techniques, as direct radionuclide cystography and (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy, have been used in evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and reflux nephropathy (RN) in children. Dynamic (99m)Tc-DTPA scintigraphy is reserved for evaluation of differential renal function and obstruction in children, where hydronephrosis is detected by ultrasonography (US) pre- or postnatally.CASE REPORT: Six year old boy was prenatally diagnosed with bilateral hydronephrosis. Postnatal, severe bilateral VUR was detected by voiding urethrocytography. US and (99m)Tc-DTPA scintigraphy performed in the first month of life showed small left kidney that participated with 2% in the global renal function. Bilateral cutaneous ureterostomy has been performed in order to obtain good renal drainage and promote optimal renal growth. Twelve months later, classic antireflux procedure was done. Control (99m)Tc-DTPA scintigraphy, 5 ys after antireflux surgery, revealed persisting radioactivity during the diuretic phase, in the left kidney that indicated antireflux procedure failure with VUR reappearance.CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-DTPA scintigraphy is the first method of choice for long-term monitoring of individual kidney function in children with VUR and other congenital urinary tract anomalies. Additionally, it can be used as indirect radionuclide cystography when rising of radioactivity in the kidney region, during the diuretic phase can indicate presence of VUR.,27275347,2016
Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Assessment of the Absorbed Dose in the Kidney of Nuclear Nephrology Paediatric Patients using ICRP Biokinetic Data and Monte Carlo Simulations with Mass-Scaled Paediatric Voxel Phantoms.,The aim of this work is to use Monte Carlo simulations and VOXEL phantoms to estimate the absorbed dose in paediatric patients (aged from 2 weeks to 16 y), with normal renal function, to whom technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) was administered, for diagnostic renal scintigraphy purposes; and compare them with values obtained using the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) methodology. In the ICRP methodology, the cumulated absorbed dose in the kidneys is estimated by multiplying the administered activity with the corresponding given dose coefficients. The other methods were based on Monte Carlo simulations performed on two paediatric voxel phantoms (CHILD and BABY), and another three phantoms, which were modified to suit the mass of the patients' kidneys, and other anatomical factors. Different S-values were estimated using this methodology, which together with solving the ICRP biokinetic model to determine the cumulated activities, allowed for the estimation of absorbed doses different from those obtained with the ICRP method, together with new dose coefficients. The obtained values were then compared. The deviations suggest that the S-values are strongly dependent on the patient's total body weight, which could be in contrast with the ICRP data, which is provided by age, regardless of other anatomical parameters.,27103650,2016
Ren Fail,Antireflux surgery does not change ongoing renal functional deterioration.,AIM: Treatment modalities of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) consist of antimicrobial prophylaxis and antireflux surgery. In this study, we aimed to determine if antireflux surgery changes the course of renal functional deterioration in children with VUR and urinary tract infections (UTI).METHODS: Medical files of patients with VUR diagnosed during evaluation for UTI were evaluated retrospectively for gender, age, follow-up period, and renal ultrasonography (US) and serial 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scintigraphy findings. Estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary protein levels were determined at the initial and last visits, and before the operation in children who had antireflux surgery. The patients were divided into two groups as solely medically treated (Group 1) and both medically and surgically treated (Group 2). Group 2 was further divided as those with stable renal function (Group 2a) and with progressive renal injury (Group 2b).RESULTS: There were 140 patients (77 female; mean age 51.6 ± 51.9 months). Group 1 and Group 2 included 82 and 58 patients, respectively. In Group 2, the number of patients with the abnormal US, DMSA scintigraphy, and renal function was higher than in Group 1. Recurrent UTI rate was similar, but progressive scarring was more prominent in the antireflux surgery group. In Group 2, 31 patients had a stable renal function (Group 2a) while 27 had progressive deterioration of renal functions (Group 2b). These subgroups were not different with respect to the rate of high-grade VUR, the presence of a renal scar in DMSA, and UTI recurrence. However, the bilateral renal scar was more common in Group 2b.CONCLUSION: Antireflux surgery does not change the course of ongoing renal injury and renal functional deterioration.,26786885,2016
Infez Med,Comparison of renal ultrasonography and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy in febrile urinary tract infection.,Accurate and early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of patient with urinary tract infection (UTI) are essential for the prevention or restriction of permanent damage to the kidneys in children. The aim of this study was to compare renal ultrasonography (US) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in the diagnosis of patients with febrile urinary tract infection. This study involved the medical records of children with febrile urinary tract infection who were admitted to the children's hospital in Qazvin, Iran. Pyelonephritis was diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and abnormal DMSA renal scans. The criteria for abnormality of renal US were an increase or a decrease in diffuse or focal parenchymal echogenicity, loss of corticomedullary differentiation, kidney position irregularities, parenchymal reduction and increased kidney size. Of the 100 study patients, 23% had an abnormal US and 46% had an abnormal DMSA renal scan. Of the latter patients, 15 had concurrent abnormal US (P value ≤ 0.03, concordance rate: 18%). Renal US had a sensitivity of 32%, specificity of 85%, positive predictive value of 65% and negative predictive value of 60%. Of the 77 patients with normal US, 31 (40.2%) had an abnormal DMSA renal scan. Despite the benefits and accessibility of renal US, its value in the diagnosis of pyelonephritis is limited.,26700082,2015
Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,Renal Abnormalities Among Egyptian Children With Hemophilia A Using Renal Scintigraphy: Relation to Risk Factors and Disease Severity.,Many risk factors may contribute to renal disease in patients with hemophilia A.AIM: We aimed to evaluate functional and structural renal abnormalities among a group of Egyptian children with severe and moderate hemophilia A using technetium-99m diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid ((99m)Tc-DTPA) and technetium-99 m dimercaptusuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) scan. We also aimed to determine the relation between these abnormalities and different risk factors and disease severity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty male patients, 16 with severe and 24 with moderate hemophilia A, were enrolled in this study. Their mean age was 10.2 ± 4.3 years (range, 5-17 years). Full history taking, clinical examination, laboratory, and radionuclide investigations including serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine analysis, creatinine clearance, 24-hour urinary protein, (99m)Tc-DTPA scan, and (99m)Tc-DMSA scan were performed to all enrolled patients.RESULTS: Serum creatinine and BUN were normal in all patients, and corrected creatinine clearance was diminished in 2 patients. However, (99m)Tc-DTPA results yielded 19 (47.5%) patients with diminished glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Moreover, it showed that 14 (35%) had obstructive uropathy, 15 (37.5%) had obstructive nephropathy, while 11 (27.5%) patients showed normal scan. One patient had atrophy of 1 kidney on (99m)Tc-DMSA scan. Among our cohort, 5 (12.5%) patients were hypertensive. Microscopic hematuria was detected in 14 (35%) patients while 72.5% had proteinuria. We found an association between hematuria and hypertension with diminished GFR.CONCLUSION: Despite normal kidney functions (serum creatinine and BUN), we found a high rate of diminished GFR and obstructive uropathy and nephropathy as detected by (99m)Tc-DTPA scan among children with hemophilia A.,26659696,2015
J Pediatr Surg,The effect of preoperative urinary tract infection on postoperative renal function in prenatally diagnosed ureteropelvic junction obstruction: Indications for the timing of pyeloplasty.,PURPOSE: We reviewed renal function after pyeloplasty (PP) in cases of prenatally diagnosed ureteropelvic junction obstruction (PDUPJO) to determine the impact of preoperative urinary tract infection (UTI) on the timing of PP.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 81 cases of PDUPJO diagnosed between 1998 and 2013. Incidence of UTI was used to divide 37 kidneys requiring PP (3 bilateral) into U(-): UTI≤1; n=25, and U(+): UTI≥2; n=12 to compare age at PP, grade of hydronephrosis (HN) on ultrasonography (US), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) on diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DTPA) renography, and uptake on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy pre/post PP.RESULTS: Age at first UTI and age at PP were similar. HN improved significantly postPP in all cases. Although DTPA and DMSA were similar prePP, improvement postPP was better in U(-) than U(+), but only DMSA in U(-) was statistically significant (15.2%±4.0% vs. 20%±3.7%; p=0.049). There were no complications or UTI postPP.CONCLUSION: Two or more UTIs would appear to be associated with postPP renal dysfunction in PDUPJO. Thus, PP should be performed after the initial UTI but before the second UTI.,26427842,2015
Pediatr Int,Renal ultrasound and DMSA screening for high-grade vesicoureteral reflux.,BACKGROUND: Selection of the appropriate radiologic investigation in a child after first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) remains a contentious issue. This report investigated the effectiveness of renal bladder ultrasound (RBUS) and late 6 month dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in the detection of high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) after first febrile UTI in infants aged &lt;1 year.METHODS: A total of 387 infants aged &lt;1 year with first febrile UTI who completed diagnostic follow up consisting of RBUS, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and late 6 month DMSA scan were enrolled in the study. The effectiveness of RBUS and DMSA scan in the detection of high-grade VUR, including cost and benefit were assessed.RESULTS: Abnormal RBUS was identified in 95 infants (24.5%). VUR was identified on VCUG in 79 (20.4%), of whom eight (2.1%) had high-grade VUR (grade IV-V). Abnormal renal parenchyma was identified on late 6 month DMSA scan in 22 infants (5.7%). The sensitivity of abnormal RBUS and of late 6 month DMSA scan in the prediction of high-grade VUR was 50% and 87.5%, and the proportion of infants who avoided unnecessary VCUG was 75.5% and 94.3%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Fifty percent of high-grade VUR was not identified on RBUS screening after first febrile UTI. Although late 6 month DMSA scan had higher sensitivity in the detection of high-grade VUR, with the added benefit of detection of renal scars, the practical application of this method was limited due to its high cost, radiation exposure and the associated delay in decision making.,26275163,2015
Rev Esp Med Nucl Imagen Mol,Follow-up (99m)Tc EC renal dynamic scintigraphy and DMSA-III SPECT/CT in unmasking a masqueraded case of Horseshoe kidney.,Hydronephrosis is a common finding in urinary tract outflow obstruction. Chronically obstructed hydronephrotic system may be associated with parenchymal changes. Ultrasound, intravenous urography, micturating cysto-urethrogram and scintigraphy are commonly performed to evaluate the cause of obstruction. In childhood, pelviureteric junction obstruction is a common cause of the hydronephrosis. Hydronephrosis can also be present in horseshoe kidneys due to poor drainage. However, a large sized hydronephrotic cavity may obscure the finding of horseshoe kidney. A case was reported, and it was diagnosed as horseshoe kidney on follow-up renal dynamic scan and confirmed with the help of dimercaptosuccinic acid SPECT/CT.,26139030,2015
Pril (Makedon Akad Nauk Umet Odd Med Nauki),Renal dysplasia in Bardet-Biedl syndrome.,BACKGROUND: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a multisystem genetic disorder characterized with central obesity, pigmentary retinopathy, polydactyly, mental retardation, and hypogenitalism. Renal abnormalities have been recognized as a cardinal feature of the disease with serious prognostic implication. The aim of this study was to analyze the renal status in children with BBS and to implement appropriate interventions in those with progressive course Patients and methods: The diagnosis of BBS was established on the basis of criteria proposed by Beales et al. (J Med Genet 1999). Imaging of the kidneys and urinary tract was performed with ultrasound study, Tc99(m)DMSA scan and a cystographic study. Twenty four hour urine collections were obtained for estimation of proteinuria and creatinine clearance. Blood pressure was monitored at clinical visits or as 24-hour ambulatory monitoring.RESULTS: There were 4 children (2 males, 2 females). All four children displayed abnormal kidney ultrasound and Tc99(m)DMSA scan resembling dysplastic kidney(s). Two of them had overt proteinuria (glomerulo-tubular pattern). Three children had normal blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate (GFR): 107, 145 and 95 ml/min/1.73m(2), and the fourth had hypertension and progressive worsening of the GFR at 65 ml/min/1.73m(2).CONCLUSION: Children with BBS should undergo imaging studies of the kidneys and urinary tract at initial work up; in those with renal dysplasia proteinuria, GFR and blood pressure should be regularly monitored to slow down progression to terminal renal failure.,26076793,2015
Iran J Kidney Dis,Predictive accuracy of urinary β2-microglobulin for kidney injury in children with acute pyelonephritis.,INTRODUCTION: Leukocyte count, erythrocyte sediment rate and C-reactive protein are available laboratory markers which may be helpful in prediction of technetium Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy results. None of these, however, have enough accuracy for prediction of renal injury and scar. This study was aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of urinary β2-microglobulin in detection of renal injury in children with acute pyelonephritis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine children between 2 months and 14 years old with the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis that had no past history of infection in the urinary tract system were enrolled in the study. A standard urine sample according to patients' age was obtained for urine culture, urinalysis, and urinary β2-microglobulin tests. Blood sample was obtained for leukocyte count, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sediment rate, and electrolytes tests. All patients underwent DMSA scan.RESULTS: The cutoff point for urinary β2-microglubulin for prediction of positive DMSA scan was 0.8 mg with a sensitivity of 40.9% (95% CI, 26.3% to 56.8%) and a specificity of 84.1% (95% CI, 69.9% to 93.4%), a positive predictive value of 72.0% (95% CI, 50.6% to 87.9%) and an negative predictive value of 58.7% (95% CI, 45.6% to 71.0%).CONCLUSIONS: Urinary β2-microglobulin is not enough sensitive and specific to be used as a diagnostic marker for prediction of renal injury. Other common markers such as erythrocyte sediment rate, leukocyte count, and C-reactive protein can be used in combination to predict kidney injury in children with acute pyelonephritis.,25599732,2015
Ann Nucl Med,Diagnostic efficacy of parametric clearance images in detection of renal scars in children with recurrent urinary tract infections.,OBJECTIVE: Static renal scintigraphy with Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is considered a scintigraphic gold standard in detection of post-inflammatory renal scars. Reports on usefulness of conventional summed (SUM) Tc-99 m mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) or Tc-99m ethylene dicysteine (EC) dynamic scintigraphic images in detection of renal scarring are ambiguous and some authors emphasize low sensitivity of this method. The work aimed at assessment of a diagnostic efficacy of parametric clearance images (PAR) generated from a dynamic renal scintigraphy in detection of renal scars.METHODS: A study group consisting of 80 children (56 girls, 24 boys, age 5-18 years) with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) and documented one to five incidents of APN-28 children, and with recurrent UTI of the lower part of the urinary tract only-52 children. Altogether 160 kidneys were evaluated. Static renal Tc-99m DMSA SPECT scintigraphy and after 2-4 days Tc-99m EC dynamic renal scintigraphy were performed in every patient not earlier than 6 months after the last documented incident of UTI. PAR images generated from a dynamic renal scintigraphy acquired between 40 and 140 s. generated by in-house developed software and SUM images obtained in the same time period were compared with a reference Tc-99m DMSA SPECT study.RESULTS: For all kinds of images (SPECT, PAR and SUM), high indices of reproducibility were obtained-89 % (κ = 0.80), 88 % (κ = 0.78) and 89 % (κ = 0.73). Agreement in a Howard scale of a reference method (SPECT) with PAR and SUM methods amounted to 83 and 64 %, respectively (p = 0.004). Sensitivity and accuracy of PAR method as compared with SUM method were significantly higher: 89 vs. 49 % (p &lt; 0.0001) and 88 vs. 73 % (p = 0.002), and specificity was slightly lower: 88 vs. 93 % (p = 0.043). SPECT and PAR methods revealed higher incidence of renal scars than a SUM method in patients with documented incident(s) of APN-64, 68 and 39 %, p = 0.009 and 0.008, respectively.CONCLUSION: PAR images generated from a dynamic renal scintigraphy improved sensitivity of detection of renal scars as compared with SUM images, providing a high reproducibility and diagnostic efficacy, similar to that of Tc-99m DMSA, in detection of post-inflammatory renal scarring.,25563578,2015
Eur J Pediatr Surg,Long-Term Results of Anderson-Hynes Pyeloplasty in Children: How Long Follow-Up Is Necessary?,PURPOSE: After a successful pyeloplasty at 3 to 6 months, the question remains whether children need a long follow-up.METHODS: The medical charts of patients with long-term follow-up (&gt; 5 years), who underwent dismembered pyeloplasty for uretero-pelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) from May 1998 to May 2007, excluding those with bilateral UPJO, solitary kidney, associated vesicoureteral reflux or other abnormalities, and inconclusive renogram due to poor renal function, were retrospectively reviewed. Ultrasonography, differential renal function (DRF, DMSA), and renal drainage on diuretic renography (diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate technetium-99 or DTPA-Tc99) were performed at 3 and 6 months every year.RESULTS: Complete data were available for 28 consecutive patients (28 renal unities) with 2 months to 12 years (mean age, 2.4 years) at surgery, of whom 21 (75%) were boys, 17 diagnosed prenatally (61%) and 18 unities (64.3%) were left, with median follow-up of 10.7 years. Images were graded according to the Society for Fetal Urology grading system: Grade III in 11 (49%) and grade IV in 17 (61%). All cases presented &gt; 10% DRF (DMSA) and obstructed DTPA-Tc99. The T1/2 (the half-time of drainage) less than 20 minutes at 3 months was found in 21 cases (75%) and less than 25 minutes in 7 cases (25%). Renal function and patency were maintained during follow-up for all units with 8% maximum fluctuation of DRF. One index case (3.6%) of renal function deterioration presented DRF fluctuation &gt; 8% at 3 months (from 23 to 32%) and progressive hydronephrosis and indeterminate DTPA at 6 months.CONCLUSIONS: Satisfactory diuretic renogram at 3 to 6 months after pyeloplasty with maintained renal function and stable hydronephrosis suggests no need for further follow-up and indicates no functional loss with time. More than 8% DRF fluctuation might be a significant cutoff for further intervention aiming nephron preservation.,25281827,2014
Pediatr Nephrol,The value of direct radionuclide cystography in the detection of vesicoureteral reflux in children with normal voiding cystourethrography.,BACKGROUND: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is one of the most important risk factors for urinary tract infection (UTI). Diagnosis and treatment of VUR is important to prevent irreversible complications, such as renal scarring and chronic renal failure. This study was conducted to assess the value of direct radionuclide cystography (DRNC) in the detection of VUR in children with UTI and a normal voiding cystourethrography (VCUG).METHODS: DRNC was performed in 35 children with a normal VCUG after an episode of febrile UTI who had hydronephrosis or hydroureter, abnormal acute dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan results and/or febrile UTI recurrence. This study was conducted in the nephrology department of Mofid Children's Hospital, Tehran (Iran).RESULTS: The results were statistically analyzed. Among the 70 ureters studied, 33 (49.1 %) were observed to have VUR. Of these, 17 (51.5 %) had mild, 14 (42.4 %) moderate, and 2 (6.1 %) severe reflux. A significant relationship was observed between DRNC results and DMSA renal scan findings (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we suggest that DRNC may reveal VUR despite a normal VCUG in children with hydronephrosis, abnormal acute DMSA, and/or recurrent febrile UTI.,25030771,2014
Pediatr Radiol,Recurrent urinary tract infections in young children: role of DMSA scintigraphy in detecting vesicoureteric reflux.,BACKGROUND: Performing micturiting cystourethrography (MCUG) in young children with recurrent urinary tract infections is controversial with discrepancy among the major guidelines.OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that a normal dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy may avoid the need of performing MCUG for detecting vesicoureteric reflux in children with first febrile urinary tract infection. However, the role of DMSA for ruling out vesicoureteric reflux in children with recurrent urinary tract infections has not been studied.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Approval from institutional ethical review committee was sought and the requirement of informed consent was waived. A total of 50 children under the age of 10 years with recurrent urinary tract infections underwent MCUG scan within 3 months of DMSA scan from January 2011 to September 2012 at our institution. Diagnosis of recurrent urinary tract infections and grading of vesicoureteric reflux was according to previously established standards. Abnormalities on DMSA scan - scarring, hydronephrosis and reduced differential renal function - were compared with presence of vesicoureteric reflux on MCUG.RESULTS: High-grade vesicoureteric reflux was noted on MCUG in 22 (44%) cases. The findings on DMSA included hydronephrosis and scarring in 25 (50%) and 25 (50%) cases, respectively. Abnormalities on DMSA scan for detecting the presence of high-grade vesicoureteric reflux on MCUG examination had sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 95.45%, 35.71%, 53.85% and 90.91%, respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.48 and 0.13 respectively.CONCLUSION: DMSA scan had high overall sensitivity and negative predictive value with a low negative likelihood ratio for ruling out high-grade vesicoureteric reflux on MCUG, which may obviate the need of invasive MCUG along with its associated drawbacks.,24993242,2014
J Pediatr Urol,Ultrasound diagnosis of multicystic dysplastic kidney: is a confirmatory nuclear medicine scan necessary?,OBJECTIVE: It is critical to differentiate between a multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) and a kidney with severe hydronephrosis as the treatment varies significantly. We designed a study to compare renal ultrasound (RUS) to nuclear medicine (NM) scan in the diagnosis of MCDK, in order to determine if RUS can be used for the definitive diagnosis of MCKD without use of NM scan.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of children with MCDK, who underwent both a RUS and Tc-99m MAG3 or DMSA scan. We planned to calculate the positive predictive value of an RUS diagnosis of MCDK, using NM scan diagnosis of a nonfunctioning kidney as the gold standard.RESULTS: The diagnosis of MCDK was made by RUS in 91 patients, 84 of whom had a normal bladder US. NM confirmed the diagnosis of MCDK in all 84 of these patients (100%).CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated a high predictive value for RUS in the diagnosis of MCDK. Our data support that in healthy infants with RUS diagnosis of unilateral MCDK and normal bladder US, NM scan may be unnecessary to confirm the diagnosis.,24909606,2014
Pediatr Int,Utility of non-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to detect acute pyelonephritis.,It has been established that enhanced computed tomography (CT) and (99m) Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy ((99m) Tc-DMSA scintigraphy) used in conjunction with single-photon emission CT is a useful tool for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN). The utility of non-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), however, has not been investigated extensively for the diagnosis of APN or renal abscess in children. We describe the case of a 23-month-old boy with suspected APN who received non-enhanced MRI. Whole body diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was used, and a background body-signal suppression sequence was applied. High-intensity focal lesions were identified on DWI and low-intensity lesions on the apparent diffusion coefficient map in the acute phase. This case suggested that non-enhanced MRI could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of APN in children, because it can avoid the risks of not only radiation exposure but also nephrogenic systemic fibrosis associated with gadolinium-based contrast agents, especially in infants.,24894941,2014
Acta Paediatr,Clinical and laboratory indices of severe renal lesions in children with febrile urinary tract infection.,AIM: To evaluate the predictive value of various clinical and laboratory parameters on the identification of acute extensive and/or multifocal renal involvement in children with febrile urinary tract infections (UTI).METHODS: The medical records of 148 children (median age: 2.4 months, range: 11 days-24 months), who were admitted during a 3-year period with a first episode of febrile UTI, were analysed. Acute dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA), clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated.RESULTS: Seventy six children (51%) had abnormal findings on the acute DMSA. Of them, 20 had DMSA grade 2, while 56 had grade 3 and 4. Patients with a DMSA grade 3 and 4 were more likely to have shivering (OR 3.4), white blood count (WBC) ≥ 18 000/μL (OR 2.4), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 9300/μL (OR 4.4), C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 50 mg/L (OR 2.7) and procalcitonin (PCT) ≥ 1.64 ng/mL (OR diagnostic). There was a significant difference of WBC (p = 0.004), ANC, CRP and PCT levels (p &lt; 0.001) between children with normal and grade 2 aDMSA versus those with aDMSA grade 3 and 4.CONCLUSIONS: Shivering and elevated inflammatory markers increase the risk of acute extensive and/or multifocal kidney involvement in children with febrile UTI. Procalcitonin seems to be an excellent marker of the severity of acute parenchymal involvement.,24862642,2014
World J Pediatr,Decreased concentrating capacity in children with febrile urinary tract infection and normal 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan: does medullonephritis exist?,BACKGROUND: Although 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (AP), sometimes it produces false results in children with clinical features of AP. There are no studies on the comparison of the sensitivity of DMSA and concentrating capacity test.METHODS: Eighty-five infants with AP of less than one year old were studied to evaluate whether they had real AP or not. Data were compared between infants with an abnormal (group A, n=64) and those with a normal DMSA scan (group B, n=21) respectively. A DDAVP test was performed for each infant.RESULTS: All the infants in both groups presented a high level of C-reactive protein and fever (≥38°C). There were no differences in clinical and analytical variables except C-reactive protein level in the two groups. Both groups exhibited a low urinary osmolality (87.5% in the group A vs. 85.7% in the group B). The patients with normal DMSA and decreased concentrating capacity have some renal parenchymal damage and not only a lower urinary infection. Of the infants with an abnormal DMSA scan, 33.9% showed renal scars after 6-12 months. No infant with a normal DMSA scan showed scars. The biochemical variables in both groups of infants were not related to vesicoureteral refl ux.CONCLUSION: Infants with AP, normal DMSA scan and low concentrating capacity may be characterized by a localized infection in the medulla (medullonephritis) or by a false negative DMSA scan.,24801233,2014
Neurourol Urodyn,Diagnostic accuracy of Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy and renal ultrasonography for detecting renal scarring and relative function in patients with spinal dysraphism.,AIMS: To study additional benefits of performing Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99m-DMSA) scintigraphy as part of the follow-up of adults with spinal dysraphism (SD), compared with ultrasonography, with regard to finding renal scarring and difference in split renal function.METHODS: Between January 2011 and April 2013 every patient visiting our specialized outpatient clinic for adults with SD was invited to undergo both renal ultrasonography and Tc-99m-DMSA scintigraphy. Outcomes of both modalities were compared, with focus on renal scarring. The relation between renal scarring and hypertension was also assessed.RESULTS: In total, 122 patients (with 242 renal units) underwent both renal scintigraphy and ultrasonography. More scars were seen on DMSA scintigraphy than on ultrasonography: 45.9% vs. 10.3% of renal units; P &lt; 0.001. Renal scarring seen on DMSA was associated with the presence of hypertension (P = 0.049) whereas scarring seen on ultrasonography was not (P = 0.10). If ultrasonography was difficult to interpret, many more scars were missed on ultrasonography (78.9%) compared with easily interpretable ultrasonographic images (30.6%; P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: In adults with SD, ultrasonography is of value to diagnose dilatation and stones of the upper urinary tract; however, compared with DMSA renography, renal scars are often missed, especially when the ultrasound is difficult to interpret.,24706504,2014
Malays J Med Sci,Diagnostic Accuracy of the Quantitative C-Reactive Protein, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate and White Blood Cell Count in Urinary Tract Infections among Infants and Children.,OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the quantitative C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and white blood cell (WBC) count in urinary tract infections (UTI) among hospitalised infants and children in Qazvin, Iran.METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 127 hospitalised children ranging in age from 2 months to 12 years old 31.79 months (SD 30.73) who were suspected of having a UTI and who did not receive antibiotics prior to being seen at a Qazvin teaching children's hospital between 2005 and 2006. A urine analysis (U/A) and urine culture (U/C) were performed. The blood was taken for CRP, ESR and WBC analyses. U/C has been considered the gold standard test for a UTI and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy (DMSA) as the gold standard for an upper UTI (pyelonephritis). These tests were used to determine the diagnostic accuracy, which is represented as the percent of correct results.RESULTS: Within the study population, 72 patients (56.7%) were younger than two years old 9.86 months (SD 4.56) and 55 (43.3%) were older than two years old 63.58 months (SD 30.96). One hundred and two patients (80.3%) were female. There were 100 cases that had a positive U/C. Of the patients with a positive U/C, 81 had pyuria (WBC more than 5/hpf), 71 had a peripheral WBC count of more than 10 000 /mL, 95 had a CRP of more than 10 mg/L and 82 had an ESR &gt; 10 mm/h. The sensitivity and specificity as well as the positive and negative predictive values and the accuracy of CRP when using U/C as the gold standard were, respectively, 96%, 11.1%, 80.2%, 50%, and 78%; when using ESR as the gold standard were, respectively, 55%, 40%, 77.6%, 17.2%, and 52%; and when using WBC counts as the gold standard were, respectively, 69%, 52%, 86.6%, 35.6%, and 65%. The accuracy of CRP, ESR and WBC counts when considering the DMSA as the gold standard were 58.3%, 62.8%, and 64.5%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Although acute phase reactants can help in the diagnosis of a UTI, they are not pathognomonic. CRP, ESR and WBC were neither completely sensitive nor specific for detecting a UTI and its localisation site in Iranian children. Therefore, in a country where advanced clinical diagnostic tests are available, the advanced test should be used in conjunction with CRP, ESR and WBC analyses. Finally, a combination of laboratory tests along with history and exact clinical examination are needed for the diagnosis of a UTI and its localisation site.,24643248,2014
Pediatr Nephrol,Efficacy of magnetic resonance urography in detecting renal scars in children with vesicoureteral reflux.,BACKGROUND: The detection of renal scars is of paramount importance for optimal clinical management of patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy of unenhanced magnetic resonance urography (MRU) and Tc-99(m) dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy to dectect renal scars.METHODS: Unenhanced MRU and Tc-DMSA scintigraphy were performed in 49 children (10 boys, 39 girls; mean age 7.4 ± 4.2 years, range 1-15 years) with documented VUR. MR imaging scans were obtained within 7 days after voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and Tc-DMSA scintigraphy. The diagnostic performance of MRU in renal scar detection was calculated relative to that of the Tc-DMSA scan.RESULTS: The renal scar detection rate of Tc-DMSA scintigraphy and unenhanced MRU in kidneys with VUR was 32.4 and 25.9%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of MRU in the detection of renal scars was 80 and 82.6% in kidneys with VUR, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in lesion detection between MRU and Tc-DMSA scintigraphy (P &gt; 0.05). MRU and Tc-DMSA scintigraphy showed good agreement (κ = 0.60).CONCLUSIONS: Unenhanced MRU is a robust technique for the morphologic assessment of the urinary system and detection of renal scars. The lack of radiation and contrast material makes this technique a much safer alternative to scintigraphy in children with VUR, particularly in those who require follow-up scanning and, consequently, considerable radiation exposure.,24500707,2014
Semin Nucl Med,Febrile urinary tract infections: clinical and laboratory diagnosis, imaging, and prognosis.,According to the literature, febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common severe bacterial infections occurring in childhood, with potential serious long-term consequences. In recent years, there have been significant developments in our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical and laboratory issues of febrile UTIs. Studies are focusing on the role of predisposing host factors related to genes regulating immune response, inflammation and fibrosis in the development of acute renal damage and subsequent processes leading to renal scars. All the available guidelines underline the importance of a correct diagnosis of febrile UTI to allow a more rational use of antibiotics and imaging. As a consequence, a shift from aggressive imaging studies to a more restrictive and targeted approach has been recently observed. Regarding the prognosis of febrile UTI, the introduction of prenatal ultrasound studies revealed that a great portion of the alterations at imaging (and thus of the clinical complications), previously attributed to postinfection scarring, were because of congenital kidney and urinary tract abnormalities. Although the long-term consequences of febrile UTIs are difficult to ascertain, it seems that children with febrile UTI, normal renal function and normal kidneys at start present a very low risk of developing decreased renal function or hypertension during follow-up. However, high body temperature and high procalcitonin levels during the acute phase of disease, which are indicative of severe inflammation, and the finding of renal scarring on imaging with DMSA scintigraphy 6 months after febrile UTI, together with the detection of congenital kidney and urinary tract abnormalities, indicate &quot;kidney at risk&quot; in UTI.,24484749,2014
Int Urol Nephrol,Correlation of 99mTc-DMSA scan with radiological and laboratory examinations in childhood acute pyelonephritis: a time-series study.,BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections are one of the most common diseases in children. They may lead to hypertension and renal failure later in life. Renal scintigraphy with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) is one method used to diagnose acute pyelonephritis (APN) and renal parenchymal scars. The aim of the present study was to determine the ideal time to perform a follow-up 99mTc-DMSA scan to detect renal scars and also to evaluate the factors predicting the development of permanent renal damage after APN.METHODS: Sixty-four children with a first episode of APN underwent a 99mTc-DMSA scan. If there were abnormal findings on this scan, another scan was performed 6 and 12 months later.RESULTS: The baseline 99mTc-DMSA scan showed cortical changes in 35 patients (54.7 %). One the 6- and 12-month follow-up scans, 25 patients (39.06 %) and 21 patients (32.8 %), respectively, had cortical lesions. In multiple logistic regressions with the final 99mTc-DMSA scan results as the dependent variable, only the age range of the patients (β = 1.062; 95 % CI 1.014-1.113; p = 0.01) showed an independent and significant association. Gender, therapeutic delay time, ultrasonography, and voiding cystourethrogram results, as well as laboratory test results including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, white blood cell counts, and type of bacteria in the urine, did not show such an association (p &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: There is not a significant difference between the results of 6- and 12-month 99mTc-DMSA follow-up scans. A follow-up 99mTc-DMSA scan should be performed 12 months after the acute scan to yield a more accurate diagnosis of permanent renal damage. If present, long-term follow-up of patients is necessary.,23728908,2013
Pediatr Nephrol,A single-center cohort of Canadian children with VUR reveals renal phenotypes important for genetic studies.,BACKGROUND: Many genes and loci have been reported in genetic studies of primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), but few have been reproduced in independent cohorts, perhaps because of phenotype heterogeneity. We phenotyped children with VUR who attended urology clinics so we could establish criteria to stratify patients based on the presence or absence of a renal malformation.METHODS: History, chart review, and DNA were obtained for 200 children with VUR from 189 families to determine the grade of VUR, the mode of presentation, and the family history for each child. Kidney length measured on ultrasound (US) and technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans at the time of VUR diagnosis were used to establish the presence of a concurrent renal malformation and identify the presence of renal scarring.RESULTS: There was an even distribution of girls and boys, and most patients were diagnosed following a urinary tract infection (UTI). Thirty-four percent of the children had severe VUR, and 25 % had undergone surgical correction. VUR is highly heritable, with 15 % of the families reporting multiple affected members. Most patients had normally formed kidneys as determined by US and DMSA imaging. Of the 93 patients who underwent DMSA imaging, 17 (18 %) showed scarring, 2 (2 %) showed scarring and diffuse reduction in uptake, and 13 (14 %) showed an isolated diffuse reduction in uptake.CONCLUSION: Prospective long-term studies of patients with primary VUR combined with renal phenotyping using US and DMSA imaging are needed to establish the presence of a renal malformation. The majority of patients in our study had no renal malformation. This cohort is a new resource for genetic studies of children with primary VUR.,23529638,2013
Pathol Biol (Paris),[Comparative study of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in the severity diagnosis of pyelonephritis in children].,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare two biologic parameters; C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) in the detection of acute renal lesions assessed by DMSA scintigraphy in the urinary tract infection in child.DESIGN: In a prospective study, serum PCT, CRP and leukocyte counts were measured for children admitted, between January and December 2010, with a first episode of febrile urinary tract infection.RESULTS: Seventy-five children were enrolled in the study. Thirty-three patients had renal lesions (group A) and 42 had a normal DMSA scintigraphy (group B). The mean PCT level was significantly higher in group A than in group B (8.81 ng/mL versus 1.7 ng/mL, P=0.01). In this study, using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, we identified that the optimal cut-off value with ideal sensitivity and specificity for PCT in detection of renal lesions was 0.76 ng/mL and for CRP, it was 70 mg/L. The sensitivity, the negative predictive value and the indice of Youden of the cut-off value of PCT were significantly higher than CRP (82% versus 70%; 84% versus 70% and 0.58 versus 0.25).CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that the serum PCT level was more sensitive and specific than the CRP in the detection of renal lesions in the first urinary tract infection in child.,23481452,2013
J Pediatr Urol,Positioning irrigation of contrast cystography for diagnosis of occult vesicoureteric reflux: association with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scans.,OBJECTIVE: Positioning irrigation of contrast (PIC) cystography identifies occult or PIC vesicoureteral reflux (PIC-VUR) in children with recurrent febrile urinary tract infections (UTI) but no vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) on standard voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). We sought to identify the relationship between PIC-VUR and renal scarring in technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed PIC cystograms and DMSA scans for 154 kidneys in 81 children (65 girls; 16 boys; median age, 4.7 years; range, 0.9-15.2). Renal scarring was graded on a scale of 0-3. DMSA scans were pathologic in 66 patients (81%). Children had experienced mean 3.8 febrile UTI (range 1-25). Forty-seven (58%) children had a history of reflux, including 15 (19%) with previous anti-reflux operations. Indications for PIC cystography were recurrence of febrile UTI after either bilateral negative VCUG (66 children) or unilateral VUR (15 children) with contralateral/bilateral scarring or reflux that had changed sides in subsequent VCUGs.RESULTS: PIC-VUR was bilateral in 63, unilateral in 12, and absent in 6 children. Statistically significant associations between PIC-VUR grade and severity of renal scarring were identified in inter-individual (n = 77, p = 0.017) and intra-individual (refluxing vs. nonrefluxing kidney; n = 12, p = 0.008) analyses. After excluding patients with history of VUR, statistical significance was maintained in inter-individual analysis (n = 49; p = 0.018).CONCLUSION: The data suggest an association between PIC-VUR and severity of renal scarring, and legitimise the use of PIC cystography in children with renal scarring due to recurrent febrile UTI but negative findings on VCUG.,23219319,2012
Korean J Urol,Abnormal dimercaptosuccinic Acid scan may be related to persistence of vesicoureteral reflux in children with febrile urinary tract infection.,PURPOSE: This study assessed whether (99m)technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy used for the assessment of renal sequelae after febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) has any prognostic value for outcome measurement of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) by retrospectively evaluating the correlation between abnormal DMSA scintigraphy results and persistence of VUR in children with febrile UTI.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 142 children (57 boys, 85 girls) admitted with febrile UTI from January 2004 to December 2006 and who were followed up for more than 1 year were retrospectively reviewed. At the initial and follow-up visits, renal ultrasound and DMSA scans were performed within 7 days from the diagnosis and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed within 1 month in all case and follow-up evaluations.RESULTS: The children's mean age was 4.8±3.6 years (range, 0.3 to 14 years). The mean follow-up was 28.2±4.8 months. At the initial examination, VUR was more often associated with an abnormal DMSA scan result (83.3%) than with a normal DMSA scan result (16.7%, p=0.02). The frequency of VUR with an abnormal DMSA scan during acute UTI was significantly higher than the frequency of VUR with a normal DMSA scan (38.8% vs, 25.8%, respectively, p=0.004). Also, high-grade VUR was associated with an abnormal DMSA scan result (32.5%) more often than with a normal DMSA scan result (0%, p=0.01). Children with an abnormal DMSA scan had a lower resolution rate of VUR (17.5%) than did children with a normal DMSA scan (75.0%) at the follow-up VCUG (p=0.02).CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal result on a DMSA scan during febrile UTI is associated with high-grade and persistent VUR. DMSA scans performed during febrile UTI are useful in reflux resolution in childhood.,23136633,2012
Acta Med Port,[Multicystic dysplastic kidney. In defense of a conservative experience].,INTRODUCTION: Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MDK) is one of the most common congenital anomalies of the urinary tract and the main cystic renal disease in children. Our institution follow-up protocol of MDK uses, as has been performed more widely in the last two decades, a conservative attitude.OBJECTIVES: To characterize MDK cases followed in our Outpatient Clinic of Pediatric Nephrology, evaluate their progress and reflect on the protocol adopted.METHODS: 36 MDK patients observed between January 1995 and December 2009 were included in this retrospective study and followed-up. In 35 children the diagnosis was the result of prenatal ultrasound. All children underwent a systematic protocol, including conservative treatment (no surgery) and periodic clinical, laboratory and ultrasound evaluation. All children underwent a MAG3 renogram or a 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy and a voiding cystourethrography, only repeated in cases of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).RESULTS: Eighteen children (50%) are male. The median age of first visit was four weeks. The median of follow-up was 65 months. The MDK was in the left kidney in 20 children (56%). The median age of onset was 10 and six weeks Contralateral nephro-urologic pathology was identified in 10 cases (28%): seven children with VUR (grade ≥ IV in three), two with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) and one with mild pelvic dilatation. There was involution of dysplastic kidney in 27 cases (75%), partial in 24 and total in three. The involution rate was higher in the first 36 months. There was a progressive compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney, with the highest rate in the first two years of life. There was resolution of VUR in five of the seven units reflux (three spontaneous and two after ureteral reimplantation). The two children with UPJO underwent surgery. There was no malignant degeneration and there was not carry out any nephrectomy of dysplastic kidney. Urinary infection occurred in nine children (25%), three of which have VUR and two with UPJO. There were no cases of hypertension or decreased glomerular filtration rate.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are generally consistent with other casuistics and confirm the fairness of a conservative attitude in the approach of children with MDK. This clinical approach is safe, with a minimum incidence of complications, with tendency to involution of dysplasic kidney being the rule.,22849946,2012
Pediatr Nephrol,Hyponatremia may reflect severe inflammation in children with febrile urinary tract infection.,BACKGROUND: Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in clinical practice, but little is known about the association between febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) and hyponatremia or its significance to clinical outcomes.METHODS: Data from 140 children with febrile UTI between 2000 and 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. Laboratory examinations [white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum sodium concentration], renal ultrasonography, (99m)Technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, and voiding cystourethrogram were performed. Culture growing &gt;50,000 colonies of one single bacterial species on a urine sample obtained by catheter or &gt;100,000 colonies on two clean-catch samples was required to establish diagnosis of UTI.RESULTS: In children with renal cortical defects diagnosed after DMSA scintigraphy (group 1), duration of fever was significantly longer (P = 0.038) and WBC (P = 0.047) and CRP (P &lt; 0.0001) levels significantly higher than in those without renal cortical defects (group 2). However, serum sodium levels were significantly lower in group 1 than group 2 (135.9 ± 2.4 vs 137.4 ± 2.7 mEq/L, P = 0.007). Hyponatremia (serum sodium ≤ 135 mEq/L) was also more frequent in group 1 than in group 2 (74.1 % vs 45.3 %, P = 0.012). Serum sodium concentration was negatively correlated with WBC count (r = -0.156, P = 0.011) and CRP levels (r = -0.160, P= 0.028).CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that hyponatremia may be a substantial inflammatory marker and is significantly and independently associated with the degree of inflammation in children with febrile UTI.,22847386,2012
Pediatr Nephrol,Renal artery revascularisation can restore kidney function with absent radiotracer uptake.,BACKGROUND: Children with renovascular hypertension often present with severe hypertension. Some children have severe obstruction of their renal arteries resulting in &lt;10% relative function on [(99m)Tc]dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Conventional treatment of these children has been nephrectomy of the poorly functioning kidney to normalise their blood pressure (BP).TREATMENT: We describe three children aged 20 months to 9 years with severe renal artery stenosis and severe hypertension who had radionucleotide uptake of 0% in one kidney. In one case, no renal perfusion was demonstrated by duplex ultrasound scan. Significant recovery of relative renal function of 18 to 52% was achieved after revascularisation by percutaneous angioplasty or open surgery of the obstructed renal artery.CONCLUSION: These cases illustrate that scintigraphy alone cannot be used to predict salvageable function in children with renovascular disease.,22744769,2012
Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl,Predisposing factors for renal scarring in children with urinary tract infection.,This study was undertaken to determine the predisposing factors for renal scarring in children with urinary tract infection. In this prospective cohort study, 176 children with documented urinary tract infection were categorized into four groups: ≤1 year old, 1-2 years old, 2-7 years and 7-14 years old. Ultrasonography and Technetium-99 m-DMSA scan were used to detect the possible abnormalities. Infants under 12 months old presented as the most common group for renal scarring (27 cases, 52.9%), and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was diagnosed in 29 cases (56.8%). Fifteen (41.67%) children between the ages of one and two years had renal scar, and VUR was detected in half of the patients. In the third group, 36.3%, and in fourth group, 41.6% of the patients had renal scar. Also, 38.6% in group three and 50% in the final group had VUR. A co-incidental finding that was observed in this study was the high incidence of pseudohypoaldesteronism (PHA) in our patients: in 39.2% of the children in group one, 22.2% in group two and 4% in group three. In group four however, none of the patients had PHA. Risk of scar formation with urinary tract infection (UTI) was higher in the younger age group and in those with recurrent UTIs.,22569440,2012
An Pediatr (Barc),[Urinary tract duplication].,OBJECTIVES: Review the clinical and radiological characteristics of the different kinds of urinary tract duplications, assessing the outcome of the cases and the incidence of renal parenchymal injury.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed including 301 children diagnosed of renal duplication by urological ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and 99-technetium renal scintigraphy (DMSA).RESULTS: They were classified in four groups. The first consisted of 166 (55.1%) cases that had complete ureteral duplication without an obstructive component (CD). The cases that had an upper system obstruction due to an ectopic ureter (EU), 19 (6.3%), or an ureterocele (UTC), 35 (11.6%), were divided into two different groups. The fourth group 81 (26.9%) had incomplete ureteral duplication. The nephro-urological study was performed in 181/301 after a urinary tract infection; in 100/301 after a prenatal finding of hydronephrosis. It was a casual diagnosis in 20/301. The percentage upper kidney dilation in the diagnostic ultrasound was significantly higher in those with EU 16/19 (84%) and in those with UTC 33/35 (94%), compared with the upper pole dilations found in the CD 35/166 (21%) and ID 21/81 (25%). Surgery was performed in 96/166 (41%) of the CD, 7/81 of the ID, 16/19 (84%) of the EU, and 34/35 (97%) of the UTC. Three cases with EU and 8 with UTC needed a second surgery, and 3 a third one. No scintigraphy changes were observed in 58% of the patients in the CD group, 87% in the ID group, 29% in the EU group, and 5% in the UTC group. As regards the renal duplications who did not have surgery, it was found that there were 98 refluxing units in the CD, and 74 in the ID. The spontaneous resolution of the vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was 80% in the CD, and 90% in the ID (McNemar test P&lt;.001). The average healing time ranged from 1 year to 5 years (Mean: 3 years and 3 months).CONCLUSION: The patients with higher risk of having renal injury are those who presented with a duplication with upper kidney obstruction due to ectopic insertion of the ureter, particularly due to an ureterocele.,22534038,2012
Clin Nucl Med,Automatic measurement of renal volume in children using 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid SPECT: normal ranges with body weight.,OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to automate volume measurement of pediatric kidneys using Technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc DMSA) SPECT. Assessment of renal size is essential in making an accurate clinical diagnosis and in evaluating normal and abnormal renal growth. Existing techniques for measuring renal length and volume are often observer-dependent and are limited by interobserver variability.MATERIALS AND METHODS: An automated method using 99mTc DMSA SPECT was developed to measure renal length, volume, and 2D/3D split renal functions. An adaptive threshold was used for segmentation of renal images. To improve measurement accuracy of renal volumes, a boundary-weighted integration and a linear correction from phantom experiments were applied. Using the new automated software, we evaluated 620 normal kidneys in 310 patients aged 1 to 21 years.RESULTS: In all, 99.4% of renal volume measurement was inter-/intraobserver reproducible without manual intervention. Correlations between renal size (volume and length) and growth parameters (age and body weight) were evaluated by nonlinear regression modeling. Body weight was found to be the best predictor of kidney volume and length (P &lt; 0.0001). Normal ranges were established according to body weight.CONCLUSIONS: Automatic renal volume measurement with 99mTc DMSA SPECT demonstrates high observer reproducibility, and it is useful for achieving accurate assessment of renal growth using sequential measurements. The renal growth models generated by this study will aid physicians in evaluating and monitoring renal growth.,22391704,2012
Pediatr Nephrol,Screening high-grade vesicoureteral reflux in young infants with a febrile urinary tract infection.,BACKGROUND: The lack of good evidence for improved outcomes in children and young infants with febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) after aggressive treatment for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has raised doubts regarding the need for routine voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), and the appropriate imaging evaluation in these children remains controversial.OBJECTIVES: This prospective study aimed to determine whether abnormalities found on acute dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and ultrasound (US) can help indicate the necessity of voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in young infants.METHODS: For 3.5 years, all infants younger than 3 months presenting with first febrile UTI were prospectively studied. All infants were hospitalized and investigated using US (&lt;3 days after admission), DMSA scan (&lt;5 days after admission), and VCUG (7-10 days after antibiotic treatment) after diagnosis. The association among findings of US, DMSA scan, and VCUG were evaluated.RESULTS: From 220 infants, there were abnormal results in 136 (61.8%) US and in 111 (50.5%) DMSA scans. By US, ten infants (4.5%) with abscess or structural abnormalities other than VUR were diagnosed. High-grade (III-V) VUR was present in 39 patients (17.7%). The sensitivities for high-grade VUR of renal US alone (76.9%) or DMSA scan alone (82.1%) were not as good as that of the &quot;OR rule&quot; strategy, which had 92.3% sensitivity and 94.3% negative predictive value.CONCLUSIONS: To screen high-grade VUR in young infants with febrile UTI, US and acute DMSA scan could be performed first. VCUG is only indicated when abnormalities are apparent on either US or DMSA scan or both.,22374404,2012
World J Pediatr,Acute phase 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan in infants with first episode of febrile urinary tract infection.,BACKGROUND: 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan is the golden standard for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and renal scaring. We investigated the use of acute phase DMSA scan in infants presented promptly to the hospital because of the first episode of their febrile urinary tract infection (UTI).METHODS: Ninety-eight infants with microbiologically confirmed first episode of febrile UTI were studied. DMSA scans were carried out within 7 days in these infants after admission. Infants with an abnormal acute DMSA scan underwent a second DMSA scan 6-12 months later.RESULTS: Overall, acute DMSA scan was abnormal in 16 (16.3%) of the 98 patients. There were no differences in sex, age, fever over 38.5°C, blood inflammation indices, or evidence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) between patients with normal and abnormal acute DMSA scan (P&gt;0.05). However, infants with grade III to V VUR as well as those with delayed treatment presented significantly increased renal involvement by acute DMSA scan (P&lt;0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of abnormal acute DMSA scan to predict grade III to V VUR were 50% and 88% respectively. Its positive and negative likelihood ratios were 4.16 and 0.57, respectively. Of 16 children with abnormal initial DMSA scan results, 14 underwent a second DMSA scan. Follow-up DMSA scans were normal in 12 of the 14 children.CONCLUSIONS: Parenchymal damage found in a minority of infants with febrile UTI presented promptly to the hospital. Acute phase DMSA scan should be carried out only in selected patients. An abnormal acute DMSA scan is a moderate predictor for dilated VUR and its ability to exclude VUR is restricted.,22282382,2012
Hell J Nucl Med,NA,A 3 years old boy with a history of surgery for orchidopexy was admitted to our hospital with fever and abdominal pain. Clinical examination and laboratory investigations revealed urinary tract infection with renal involvement. Ultrasonography demonstrated a solitary left kidney and raised the suspicion of a fusion anomaly. Voiding cystography disclosed grade III vesicoureteral reflux and technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy revealed right to left crossed renal ectopia with fusion (L-shaped kidney). The patient is undergoing standard follow-up for the early detection of possible renal complications. In conclusion, L-shaped kidney is a rare entity and the (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy played an important role on timely diagnosis.,22087453,2011
Acta Med Iran,Renal power Doppler ultrasonographic evaluation of children with acute pyelonephritis.,Urinary tract infections are common in children. The available gold standard method for diagnosis, Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scan is expensive and exposes patients to considerable amount of radiation. This study was performed to compare and assess the efficacy of Power Doppler Ultrasound versus Tc-99m DMSA scan for diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. A quasi experimental study was conducted on 34 children with mean age of 2.8 ± 2.7 years who were hospitalized with their first episode of febrile urinary tract infection. All children were evaluated in the first 3 days of admission by Doppler Ultrasound and Tc-99m DMSA scan. Patients with congenital structural anomalies were excluded. Each kidney was divided into three zones. The comparison between efficacy of Doppler Ultrasound and DMSA scan was carried out based on number of patients and on classified renal units. Based on the number of patients enrolled; the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy of Doppler Ultrasound were 89%, 53%, 70%, 80% and 74%, respectively but based on the renal units, it was 66%, 81%, 46%, 91% and 79% , respectively. Although Doppler Ultrasound has the potential for identifying acute pyelonephritis in children, but it is still soon to replace DMSA scan.,22071640,2011
Pediatr Surg Int,Urinary tract anomalies associated with high grade primary vesicoureteral reflux.,BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the significance of associated urological anomalies in vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of associated urological anomalies in patients with high grade VUR and to assess their impact on renal parenchymal scarring.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of 1,765 consecutive cases diagnosed with high grade VUR (Grade III-V) at our hospital between 1998 and 2010. The diagnosis of VUR was made by a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). Renal scarring was evaluated by dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy and classified into three groups: mild (focal defects in uptake between 40 and 45%), moderate (uptake of renal radionuclide between 20 and 40%), and severe (shrunken kidney with relative uptake &lt;20%). All associated urological anomalies were diagnosed by ultrasound or VCUG or DMSA scan.RESULTS: Associated urological anomalies were present in 229 (13%) children. There were 87 boys and 142 girls. Duplex kidney was the main associated anomaly occurring in 148 (64.6%) of the 229 patients. Other anomalies were: bladder diverticulum in 29, solitary kidney in 12, ureterocele in 13, hypospadiasis in 11, pelviureteric junction obstruction in 9, malrotated kidney in 3, horseshoe kidney in 2, crossed fused ectopia in 1 and renal cyst in 1. DMSA scan revealed renal scarring in 105 (47.7%) of the 220 children who had a DMSA scan. 75 (50.7%) children with duplex kidneys showed renal scarring.CONCLUSION: Associated urological anomalies occur commonly in patients with high grade VUR. Our data shows that nearly half of the patients with VUR and associated urological anomalies have renal scarring. Early recognition and treatment of VUR patients with associated urological anomalies may decrease the risk of renal parenchymal damage.,21994077,2011
Biomark Insights,Plasma soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor in children with urinary tract infection.,OBJECTIVE: In this prospective study we investigated the role of plasma levels of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) in children with urinary tract infection.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We measured the levels of plasma suPAR during admission in 42 children with suspected acute pyelonephritis and compared the results to acute DMSA scintigraphy.RESULTS: The mean level of plasma suPAR at admission was significantly elevated in children with renal involvement (7.3 ng/ml) assessed by the DMSA scintigraphy compared to children without renal involvement (4.4 ng/ml, P = 0.010). The positive predictive value of suPAR seems high, since all patients without renal involvement had low suPAR values. During treatment the mean level of plasma suPAR decreased.CONCLUSION: We conclude that plasma suPAR could be of clinical use for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and that high levels of plasma suPAR might reflect the level of renal involvement and could therefore be a new indicator for renal scarring.,21918598,2011
Korean J Pediatr,Discordant findings on dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy in children with multi-detector row computed tomography-proven acute pyelonephritis.,PURPOSE: The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) is often difficult, as its clinical and biological manifestations are non-specific in children. If not treated quickly and adequately, however, APN may cause irreversible renal damage, possibly leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. We were suspecting the diagnostic value of (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan by experiences and so compared the results of DMSA scan to those of multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT).METHODS: We retrospectively selected and analyzed 81 patients who were diagnosed as APN by MDCT during evaluation of their acute abdomen in emergency room and then received DMSA scan also for the diagnostic work-up of APN after admission. We evaluated the results of imaging studies and compared the diagnostic value of each method by age groups, &lt;2 years (n=45) and ≥2 years (n=36).RESULTS: Among total 81 patients with MDCT-proven APN. DMSA scan was diagnostic only in 55 children (68%), while the remaining 26 children (32%) showed false negative normal findings. These 26 patients were predominantly male with average age of 21 months and most of them, 19 (73.1%) were &lt;2 years of age.CONCLUSION: DMSA scan has obvious limitation compared to MDCT in depicting acute inflammatory lesions of kidney in children with APN, especially in early childhood less than 2 years of age. MDCT showed hidden lesions of APN, those were undetectable through DMSA scan in children.,21829413,2011
Prog Urol,[Management and follow-up of antenatally diagnosed primary megaureters].,INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To study the diagnostic and outcome aspects of antenatally diagnosed primary megaureters and analyse the results of the postnatal medicochirurgical management.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors report a retrospective analysis of 12 patients been born between 1998 and 2009 with primary megaureter antenatally diagnosed between 20 and 32weeks of gestation. A postnatal radiological assessment comprising urinary tract ultrasound, DTPA or MAG3 renal scintigraphy, retrograde cystography, DMSA renal scintigraphy and intravenous urography was performed. All the patients were put under urinary antiseptic treatment and followed since the birth.RESULTS: This study comprised nine boys and three girls, all been born at term with normal trophicity. Mean age of antenatal diagnosis of hydronephrosis was 26weeks of gestation. Mean age of definitive postnatal diagnosis was ten months. Left megaureter was seen in five children, right in two cases and five patients had bilateral megaureter comprising a total of 17 renal units of which eight units were non-obstructed/non-refluxing, three units were refluxing, five units were obstructed and one unit was obstructed and refluxing. Megaureter was associated to controlateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction syndrome in one patient and to ipsilateral ureteral duplicity with a superior polar kidney in another case. Renal function was less than 20% in four renal units. The mean follow-up was four years (range : 10months to 11years). Outcome was marked by urinary infections in seven cases of which four patients had non-obstructed/non-refluxing megaureter. Six patients required surgical correction, two for non-obstructed/non-refluxing megaureter complicated with urinary recurring infections, three for obstructed megaureter with severe renal functional deterioration and one patient for bilateral refluxing megaureter grade V. Two other patients required surgical treatment, one for controlateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction syndrome and the other for ipsilateral ureteral duplicity with destroyed superior polar kidney. Mean age at surgery was 22,6months (range : 6 months to 7 years).CONCLUSION: Half of our patients with antenatal diagnosis of primary megaureter required surgical correction. Urinary recurring infections, renal functional deterioration less than 20% and importance of ureteral dilatation with vesico-ureteric reflux grade V were predictive factors for surgery.,21693361,2011
Pediatrics,Acute Tc-99m DMSA scan for identifying dilating vesicoureteral reflux in children: a meta-analysis.,Controversy exists regarding the type and/or sequence of imaging studies needed during the first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in young children. Several investigators have claimed that because acute-phase Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal-scan results are abnormal in the presence of dilating vesicoureteral reflux, a normal DMSA-scan result makes voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) unnecessary in the primary examination of infants with UTI. To evaluate the accuracy of acute-phase DMSA scanning in identifying dilating (grades III through V) vesicoureteral reflux documented by VCUG in children with a first febrile UTI, we performed a meta-analysis of the accuracy of diagnostic tests as reported from relevant studies identified through the PubMed and Scopus databases. Patient-based and renal unit-based analyses were performed. Overall, 13 cohort studies were identified. Nine studies involved patients younger than 2 years, 3 involved children aged 16 years or younger, and 1 involved exclusively neonates. Girls constituted 22% to 85% of the involved children. Pooled (95% confidence intervals) sensitivity and specificity rates of DMSA scanning were 79% and 53%, respectively, for the patient-based analysis (8 studies) and 60% and 65% for the renal unit-based analysis (5 studies). The respective areas under the hierarchical summary receiver operating curves were 0.71 and 0.67. Marked statistical heterogeneity was observed in both analyses, as indicated by I(2) test values of 91% and 87%, respectively. Acute-phase DMSA renal scanning cannot be recommended as replacement for VCUG in the evaluation of young children with a first febrile UTI.,21669900,2011
Clinics (Sao Paulo),Renal function in children with congenital neurogenic bladder.,AIMS: Preservation of renal function in children with congenital neurogenic bladder is an important goal of treatment for the disease. This study analyzed the evolution of renal function in patients with congenital neurogenic bladder.METHODS: We reviewed the records of 58 pediatric patients with respect to the following attributes: gender, age, etiology of neurogenic bladder, reason for referral, medical/surgical management, episodes of treated urinary tract infections, urodynamics, DMSA scintigraphy, weight, height, blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, microalbuminuria and metabolic acidosis. Statistical analysis was performed, adopting the 5% significance level.RESULTS: The mean age at presentation was 4.2 ± 3.5 years. Myelomeningocele was the most frequent etiology (71.4%). Recurrent urinary tract infection was the reason for referral in 82.8% of the patients. Recurrent urinary tract infections were diagnosed in 84.5% of the patients initially; 83.7% of those patients experienced improvement during follow-up. The initial mean glomerular filtration rate was 146.7 ± 70.1 mL/1.73 m²/min, and the final mean was 193.6 ± 93.6 mL/1.73 m²/min, p = 0.0004. Microalbuminuria was diagnosed in 54.1% of the patients initially and in 69% in the final evaluation. Metabolic acidosis was present in 19% of the patients initially and in 32.8% in the final assessment.CONCLUSIONS: Patient referral to a pediatric nephrologist was late. A reduction in the number of urinary tract infections was observed with adequate treatment, but microalbuminuria and metabolic acidosis occurred frequently despite adequate management.,21484032,2011
Pediatr Nephrol,Clinical and laboratory features of Macedonian children with OCRL mutations.,OCRL mutations, which are a hallmark of Lowe syndrome, have recently been found in patients with isolated renal phenotype (Dent-2 disease). In this report, we describe clinical and laboratory features in five Macedonian children with mutations in the OCRL gene. Children with a clinical diagnosis of Lowe syndrome or Dent disease underwent complete neurological and ophthalmological examination, imaging of the kidney and urinary tract, assessment of renal tubular function, and mutation analysis of the OCRL gene. Two children (18 months and 11 years, respectively) were diagnosed with Lowe syndrome on the basis of congenital cataracts, severe psychomotor retardation, and renal dysfunction. Both children had low molecular weight proteinuria (LMWP) and hypercalciuria, but not Fanconi syndrome. The older one had bilateral nephrolithiasis due to associated hypocitraturia and mild hyperoxaluria. Three children with asymptomatic proteinuria were diagnosed with Dent-2 disease; none had cataracts or neurological deficit. One child showed mild mental retardation. All had LMWP, hypercalciuria, and elevated enzymes (creatine phosphokinase, lactic dehydrogenase). All three children had an abnormal Tc-99m DMSA scan revealing poor visualization of the kidneys with a high radionuclide content in the bladder; none had nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. In conclusion, children with OCRL mutations may present with very mild phenotype (asymptomatic proteinuria with/without mild mental retardation) or severe classic oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe. Elevated enzymes and abnormal results on the Tc-99m DMSA scan may be useful indicators for Dent-2 disease.,21249396,2011
Med Ultrason,Ultrasonography contribution in detection of reno-urinary anomalies: a cohort study.,AIMS: The current study aims to assess the role of ultrasound (US) parameters in explaining the variance of hydronephrosis grades in reno-urinary anomalies, as well as their performance in quantifying the incidence of patients with uropathies.METHODS: In this study 196 patients were prospectively included. All of them had renal/urinary tract anomalies and were recruited from 5992 US examined hospitalized patients. Fifty patients were referred also to renal 99mTc- DMSA or 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy. The diagnostic performance of renal ultrasound and scintigrafy parameters was assessed.RESULTS: Pelvis antero-posterior diameter (APD) values were strongly correlated with other investigated parameters. They correlated with measurements of US parenchyma values (r=0.59, p=0.001), pelvis area (r=0.76, p=0.001) and with scintigraphy long axis measurements (r=0.89, p=0.001). In multiple regression analysis, the pelvis APD is the only independent predictor of high grades hydronephrosis (p=0.001) and explained 62.4% of the variance of hydronephrosis grades. The cut-off values for detection of significant hydronephrosis (grades 3,4) was 11 mm or more, and for detection of severe, in need of surgery, hydronephrosis was 19 mm or more.CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic performance of ultrasound was good, similar to those previously published by other authors. US detected pelvis APD is the main predictor for high grades hydronephrosis but other parameters also influence the uropathy grades.,21203597,2011
Ann Acad Med Stetin,Static renal scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA for the assessment of renal damage after therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children.,INTRODUCTION: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its treatment may adversely affect kidney function. The aim of the present study was to determine whether 99mTc-DMSA static renal scintigraphy can be used to disclose kidney damage at the end of therapy for ALL in children.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 48 ALL patients aged 6.6-22.9 years, with a mean time of continuous complete remission of 51 months. Static renal scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA was performed in all patients.RESULTS: Minor scars in the renal cortex were diagnosed with scintigraphy in 6 (13%) patients. A significant correlation was found between renal scarring and a history of urinary tract infection.CONCLUSIONS: No clinically significant kidney damage was found after completion of treatment of ALL. Static renal scintigraphy may be a valuable noninvasive method for visualization of renal cortex pathology.,23002662,2011
Nucl Med Rev Cent East Eur,Assessment of clinical usefulness of parametric clearance images in diagnosis of kidney cicatrisation in children with chronic infections of the urinary tract.,BACKGROUND: Cicatrisation of the renal cortex is closely related to chronic infections of the urinary system. Static renal scintigraphy is used as the method enabling detection of local defects of radiopharmaceutical uptake, and is treated as the &quot;gold standard&quot; in the diagnosis of renal scars. The aim of the reported investigation was a comparison of the diagnostic efficacy of parametric clearance images and the conventional summation images - obtained from dynamic scintigraphy - in the detection of local defects of renal function. As the &quot;gold standard&quot; for the above comparison, the static scintigraphy of kidneys was accepted.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-one patients (age 4-19 years), 28 girls and 13 boys, participated in the study. Altogether, 73 kidneys were analyzed (in 9 patients, only one kidney). In each patient dynamic renal scintigraphy was performed after IV administration of 99mTc EC (ethylenedicysteine) and static planar renal scintigraphy using 99mTc-DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) as a reference method. From the dynamic study, summation and parametric clearance images were generated. Each kidney was divided into 3 segments (upper, middle, lower); altogether 219 segments were evaluated by modified Howard's scale. Planar and oblique projection images were compared with corresponding summation and parametric clearance images.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Parametric clearance imaging has a higher sensitivity and accuracy for detection of regional post-inflammatory changes in the kidneys than conventional summation images (p &lt; 0.05) and shows parenchymal changes similarly to static scintigraphy (high Cohen's kappa index).,21154310,2010
Ann Nucl Med,Diagnostic role of initial renal cortical scintigraphy in children with the first episode of acute pyelonephritis.,OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in children has been the subject of debate for many years. Diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) is usually based on clinical and biological data. The clinical usefulness of early Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy remains controversial, although it may influence the type and duration of treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the role of initial cortical scintigraphy in the detection of early renal parenchymal damage in children highly suspected of having APN and to compare the scintigraphic findings with selected clinical/laboratory parameters and ultrasonography.METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in 34 infants and young children (18 boys, 16 girls), aged 1.5-36 months (mean 9.8 ± 8.7 months), hospitalized with a first episode of clinically suspected APN. Within the first 5 days after admission, Tc-99m DMSA renal scintigraphy, ultrasonography (US), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC) and urine analyses were performed.RESULTS: DMSA scintigraphy showed changes consistent with APN in 27/34 (79%) patients, with a mean age of 10.9 months, including 12 males (44%) and 15 (56%) females. Out of 9 febrile children with negative urine culture and supportive evidence of UTI, scintigraphy showed parenchymal involvement in 8 children (24% in the whole group, 30% in scintigraphically documented APN). There were no statistically significant correlations between the frequency or size of the initial scintigraphic abnormalities and age, sex, body temperature, CRP levels or ESR. A CRP level of &gt;54 mg/L and a WBC of &gt;13,300/mm³ had sensitivities of 56 and 59% and specificities of 86 and 71%, respectively. US showed changes consistent with APN in 7/34 (21%) in the whole group and in 7/27 (26%) patients with positive cortical scan (p &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: Initial DMSA renal scintigraphy is a sensitive method for the early diagnosis of APN in young children and is useful in the assessment of the severity of kidney injury even in patients with negative urine culture. Clinical, biological and ultrasound parameters do not identify children with renal damage. Normal DMSA study, excluding parenchymal involvement and late sequelae, could minimize the use of scintigraphy in the follow-up and reduce the redundancy of cystography.,21080122,2010
Iran J Kidney Dis,Technetium Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy in children with acute pyelonephritis: correlation with other imaging tests.,INTRODUCTION. Urinary tract infection is the most common serious bacterial infection in children. The aim of this study was to compare the value of different laboratory and imaging techniques in detecting renal involvement in acute pyelonephritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In a cross-sectional study of patients 1 month to 14 years of age diagnosed with urinary tract infection were examined with systemic inflammatory markers, renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), and technetium Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy. A total of 1467 pediatric patients were eligible for treatment of pyelonephritis. Evaluations included a complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urinalysis, urine culture, and measurement of serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. RESULTS. The results of (99m)Tc-DMSA scans were normal in 20.2%, mild decreased cortical uptake in 45.0%, moderate decreased cortical uptake in 12.3%, severe decreased cortical uptake in 12.0%, and decreased cortical function plus irregularity or scar formation in 10.5%. Voiding cystourethrography showed vesicoureteral reflux in 25.9%. The sensitivity of (99m)Tc-DMSA for prediction of vesicoureteral reflux was 84.1% with a negative predictive value of 80.6%. Significant differences were found in the level of blood leukocyte count (P = .03), urine leukocyte count (P = .003), ESR (P = .008), and age (P = .04) between patients with normal and abnormal (99m)Tc-DMSA scan results. CONCLUSIONS. We found that in patient with clinical signs of pyelonephritis, (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy can detect pyelonephritis more accurately than the other inflammatory and imaging tests.,20852370,2010
Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,[Efficacy of acute (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan in predicting vesicoureteral reflux among young children with febrile urinary tract infection].,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning in predicting vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) among young children with febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) and to investigate the priority in applying either micturating cystourethrography (MCU) or DMSA.METHODS: The medical records of children (age &lt; or = 2 years), presenting with febrile UTI between January 2000 and December 2009, were retrospectively reviewed. All cases underwent DMSA renal scan within 1 week after diagnosis and MCU within 1 week after infection. According to the results of MCU, children were divided into groups of non-VUR, low-grade and high-grade VUR.RESULTS: A total of 370 children (233 boys, 137 girls) were included, of whom 263 (71.1%) had abnormal DMSA results and 126 (34.1%) were identified as VUR on MCU. Among children with VUR, the number of high-grade was 103 (81.7%). The rate of abnormal results on DMSA of high-grade VUR group was significantly higher than the rates of the other two groups (P &lt; 0.01). The sensitivity of DMSA for detecting high grade VUR was 99.0%. The negative predictive value was 99.1% and negative likelihood ratio was 0.03, respectively.CONCLUSION: High-grade VUR remains an important risk factor of renal damage for young children with febrile UTI. The possibility to detect high-grade VUR on MCU is rather low when the result of DMSA is negative. It is recommended that DMSA be used before MCU to investigate the febrile UTI children at acute phase, because it would predict the majority of children with high-grade VUR while detecting renal lesions.,20654031,2010
Urology,Does severity of renal scarring on DMSA scan predict abnormalities in creatinine clearance?,OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between severity of renal scarring and creatinine clearance. Existing studies on renal scarring and functional outcomes have focused on the presence or absence of scarring.METHODS: Patients with a history of urinary tract infection leading to the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux were recruited. These subjects were admitted to a pediatric research center for an in-patient collection of 24-hour urine to be sent for creatinine and protein. DMSA scans performed at least 6 months after documented urinary tract infection were graded by 3 independent, blinded pediatric urologists for renal scarring according to the Randomized Intervention for Children with Vesicoureteral Reflux study criteria.RESULTS: Twenty-nine subjects (14 girls, 15 boys) with a median age of 7 years were recruited. Scar grading was reliable between the observers with a Kappa score of 0.66-0.75. On DMSA scan, 10% were scar-free, 62% had unilateral scars, and 28% had bilateral scars. Mean creatinine clearance was 123 for those with unilateral disease and 100 for those with bilateral disease (P = .048). Median proteinuria (58 mg/dL) and serum creatinine (0.5 mg/dL) were similar between the 2 groups. Creatinine clearance did not differ according to average scar grade, taking both kidneys into account.CONCLUSIONS: In children with vesicoureteral reflux, although those with bilateral scarring have a significantly lower creatinine clearance than those with unilateral scarring, the severity of scar grade alone does not predict overall creatinine clearance with short-term follow-up.,20472269,2010
Hell J Nucl Med,Potential diagnostic role of renal scintigraphy in the management of patients with high anorectal malformation.,Urological problems are the leading associated anomalies in patients with anorectal malformation (ARM). In this study, we evaluated the role of scintigraphy in managing patients with high ARM. The records of infants with urologic anomalies on abdominal ultrasound and referred for scintigraphic evaluation were retrospectively analyzed. Diuretic renography in these patients was performed using (99m)Tc-diethyl triamine penta-acetic acid ((99m)Tc-DTPA) or (99m)Tc-ethylene cysteine ((99m)Tc-EC) while cortical scintigraphy was performed with (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA). Whenever available, EC was preferred in children of age less than 1 year. Forty patients (38 males, 2 females) were analyzed. The mean age of the population was 25 months (range 15 days-21 years). Eighteen of the forty patients were less than 3 months of age. Twenty seven of the patients were less than one year of age. The most common renal anomaly was unilaterally non-visualized kidney affecting 15 out of the 40 patients. The visualised kidney was abnormal in 8/15 patients. Hydronephrotic changes were noticed in 12 of 40 patients of whom 2 had pelvi ureteric junction obstruction that was confirmed and treated surgically. Horse shoe kidney was present in 1 patient while 2 had an ectopic kidney. Scarring/ pyelonephritic changes were found in 7/40 patients. Five patients had already progressed to chronic renal failure at the time of scintigraphy. Only 8 patients of the 40 had bilaterally normal kidneys. In conclusion, this study suggests that urologic abnormalities often found in infants with high ARM may remain clinically silent and eventually lead to chronic renal failure. Proper evaluation by diuretic renography and cortical scintigraphy can lead to early identification of potentially treatable conditions hence reducing the likelihood of developing severe renal damage.,19936340,2009
J Pediatr,Serum procalcitonin for prediction of renal parenchymal involvement in children with urinary tract infections: a meta-analysis of prospective clinical studies.,OBJECTIVE: To determine by meta-analysis whether serum procalcitonin (PCT) is a useful marker of acute renal parenchymal involvement (RPI) in children with culture-proven urinary tract infection (UTI), as diagnosed by acute-phase DMSA (Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid) renal scintigraphy.STUDY DESIGN: We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for prospective studies involving children with culture-proven UTIs. Additional eligibility criteria were measurement of serum PCT at presentation and performance of DMSA scintigraphy within 14 days.RESULTS: Overall, 10 studies eligible for inclusion, involving a total of 627 children, were identified. Half of these studies evaluated children with a first episode of UTI; 8 involved children with febrile UTIs. Using a cutoff value of 0.5 to 0.6 ng/mL, the pooled diagnostic odds ratio of serum PCT for UTI with RPI was 14.25 (95% confidence interval, 4.70 to 43.23). High statistical between-study heterogeneity that could mainly be attributed to 2 studies was observed. The remaining 8 studies uniformly favored PCT use.CONCLUSIONS: In children with culture-proven UTI, a serum PCT value &gt;0.5 ng/mL predicts reasonably well the presence of RPI, as evidenced by DMSA scintigraphy. PCT may aid in the identification of children with UTI, necessitating more intense evaluation and management.,19850301,2009
Pediatr Nephrol,Pre- and postcaptopril renal scintigraphy as a screening test for renovascular hypertension in children.,We studied the ability of pre- and postcaptopril renal scintigraphy to predict renovascular disease (RVD) in children. Retrospective review of medical notes and radiology reports of all hypertensive children who had had both pre- and postcaptopril renal scintigraphy with [(99m)Tc] dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and/or [(99m)Tc] mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). 81 children aged 1-18 (median 10) years were studied with 62% (51) having a diagnosis of RVD. Main renal artery disease, intrarenal disease, and both main and intrarenal artery disease were present in 25, 14, and 12 patients respectively. The isotope study accurately diagnosed RVD, confirmed by DSA, in 47% (24 of 51) children, with eight false positive studies. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the isotope study to predict RVD were 48%, 73%, 76%, and 51%, respectively. Pre- and postcaptopril renal scintigraphy was unable to predict RVD in children.,19756764,2009
Pediatrics,Implications of 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy performed during urinary tract infection in neonates.,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively whether normal scintigraphic results during urinary tract infections (UTIs) in neonates were predictive of the absence of dilating vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (grade &gt; or =III) and permanent renal damage (PRD).METHODS: Term neonates with a first symptomatic, community-acquired UTI participated in the study. Urinary tract ultrasonography and technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy were performed within 72 hours after diagnosis and voiding cystourethrography within 1 to 2 months. DMSA scintigraphy, to determine the development of PRD, was repeated 6 months after UTI.RESULTS: Seventy-two neonates (144 renal units) were enrolled. Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed through early DMSA scintigraphy in 19% of renal units, VUR in 22%, and grade &gt; or =III VUR in 13%. The majority (71%) of renal units with grade &gt; or =III VUR had normal early DMSA scintigraphic results. The sensitivity and specificity of abnormal early DMSA scintigraphic results to predict grade &gt; or =III VUR were 29% (95% confidence interval: 11%-55%) and 82% (95% confidence interval: 74%-88%), respectively. PRD was found in 7% of renal units, all of which had abnormal early DMSA scintigraphic results. PRD was significantly more frequent among renal units with grade &gt; or =III VUR than among nonrefluxing renal units (P &lt; .05).CONCLUSIONS: Normal early DMSA scintigraphic results for neonates with symptomatic UTIs were helpful in ruling out later development of PRD but were not predictive of the absence of dilating VUR. To rule out dilating VUR, voiding cystourethrography may be required.,19661052,2009
AJR Am J Roentgenol,Comparison of 99mTc-DMSA dual-head SPECT versus high-resolution parallel-hole planar imaging for the detection of renal cortical defects.,OBJECTIVE: Renal cortical scintigraphy with (99m)Tc dimer captosuccinic acid (DMSA) is the standard method to detect acute pyelonephritis and cortical scarring. Different acquisition methods have been used: planar parallel-hole or pinhole collimation and single photon emission tomography (SPECT). Publications support the superiority of each; few comparative studies have been reported, with mixed results. We have compared planar parallel-hole cortical scintigraphy and dual-head SPECT for detection of cortical defects.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients (37 children, 3 adults; 9 male, 31 female) were imaged 3 hours after injection of (99m)Tc-DMSA with dual-head SPECT and planar imaging (posterior, left, and right posterior oblique views with a parallel-hole collimator). For each patient, planar and SPECT images were evaluated at different sittings, in random order, by three independent observers. Twelve cortical segments were scored as normal or reduced uptake. The linear correlation coefficient for the number of abnormal segments detected between readers, techniques, and segments was calculated.RESULTS: No significant difference was seen in the average number of abnormal segments detected by planar versus SPECT imaging; 2.1 for planar imaging and 2.2 for SPECT (p = 0.84, two-tailed). For all observers, the average correlation coefficient for SPECT alone, planar imaging alone, and between techniques (SPECT vs planar imaging) was high (r = 0.93-0.94). Applying nonparametric Spearman's rank analysis, the average correlation remained high (r = 0.70-0.75). Correlation between readers, techniques, and segments for methods and readers was also good (r = 0.69-0.77).CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-DMSA renal cortical imaging using dual-head SPECT offers no statistically significant diagnostic advantage over planar imaging for detection of cortical defects.,19620428,2009
Acta Paediatr,Ultrasonography as predictor of permanent renal damage in infants with urinary tract infection.,AIM: To evaluate the ability of ultrasound (US) in infants (&lt;1 year) with acute urinary tract infection (UTI), to identify those with permanent renal damage (PRD) at scintigraphy 1 year later.METHODS: US, dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy and voiding cystourethrography were performed in 191 infants.RESULTS: US was abnormal in 46 infants (24%). PRD was found in 46 infants (24%); 19 of these had abnormal US (sensitivity 41%). In 145 infants without PRD, 27 had abnormal US (specificity 81%). Dilating reflux or verified obstruction occurred in 21 (11%) infants, of whom 18 (86%) had PRD while 28 of 170 (16%) without such diagnoses had PRD. Of 16 infants with dilating reflux, 9 (sensitivity 56%) had abnormal US and 14 (88%) PRD. Dilatation at US was seen in 27 children; 7 of these had dilating reflux and 5 verified obstruction.CONCLUSION: US performed in association with acute UTI had limited ability to identify children with PRD at (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) 1 year later, although abnormal renal size was a strong indicator of renal damage. The ability of US to identify children with dilating reflux was also limited. However, once detected at US, dilatation of the urinary tract was associated with dilating reflux or obstruction in half of the cases. Our study confirms that dilating reflux and obstruction are strong indicators of PRD but only half of those who developed PRD had such diagnoses.,19397555,2009
AJR Am J Roentgenol,Imaging in pediatric urinary tract infection: a 9-year local experience.,OBJECTIVE: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease entity in children, and a number of imaging options are offered for these patients. The purpose of our study was to retrospectively describe the (99m)Tc-labeled dimer captosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy, ultrasound, and micturating cystourethrography (MCU) findings over a 9-year period.MATERIALS AND METHODS: All children younger than 10 years old who presented to a local hospital in Hong Kong between July 1, 1997, and June 30, 2006, with culture-confirmed UTI and who subsequently underwent DMSA scintigraphy, ultrasound, and MCU were identified. For the purpose of this study, patients with underlying major congenital urinary tract abnormalities were excluded. DMSA scintigraphy was regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of renal scarring. DMSA scintigraphy, ultrasound, and MCU findings and clinical outcomes were reviewed and analyzed.RESULTS: A total of 583 children were included in the study. Of these, 432 children (74.1%) had normal findings on ultrasound and on MCU. Only 13 children (3%) of this group had renal scarring as shown on DMSA scintigraphy. The overall negative predictive value (NPV) for excluding renal scarring of combined ultrasound and MCU reached 97%. The NPV was 97.7% in the subgroup of patients 0 to 2 years old.CONCLUSION: For children younger than 2 years with UTI in the absence of underlying major congenital urinary tract abnormalities, we recommend that DMSA scintigraphy may be withheld if findings on both ultrasound and MCU examinations are normal.,19380548,2009
J Pediatr,Screening young children with a first febrile urinary tract infection for high-grade vesicoureteral reflux with renal ultrasound scanning and technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid scanning.,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive value of renal ultrasound scanning and 99m-Technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy for high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in young children with a first urinary tract infection (UTI).STUDY DESIGN: The medical records of children who had been examined with renal ultrasound scanning, DMSA scanning, and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) were reviewed. The findings of renal ultrasound scanning, DMSA scanning, and their predictive values were evaluated.RESULTS: Of 699 children, high-grade VUR (grades III-V) was diagnosed in 119 (17.0%). Signs of renal hypodysplasia (OR, 16.15), cyclic dilatation of pelvicaliceal system (OR, 11.73), hydroureter (OR, 4.00) with renal ultrasound scanning, and renal hypodysplasia (OR, 8.78), acute pyelonephritis (OR, 2.76) with DMSA scanning were associated with high-grade VUR. The sensitivities for high-grade VUR of ultrasound scanning alone (67.2%) or DMSA scanning alone (65.5%) were not as good as that of a both-test strategy, which had a sensitivity rate of 83.2%. The negative predictive value of the both-test strategy was 91.5%.CONCLUSION: Renal ultrasound scanning and DMSA scanning both should be routinely performed in children with a first febrile UTI. VCUG is only indicated when abnormalities are apparent on either ultrasound scanning or DMSA scanning or both.,19230904,2009
Q J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,Scintigraphic imaging in renal infections.,The scintigraphic imaging modality of choice in the evaluation of renal infections is renal cortical scintigraphy utilizing [(99m)Tc]dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). This technique is able to demonstrate upper tract involvement with infection and to assess for the presence of renal cortical scarring following a urinary tract infection (UTI). There are recent publications advocating its use to determine which patients need to proceed to further investigation with cystography. It is also being utilized in the evaluation of different treatment regimes used in patients with UTI. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and leukocyte scanning have only a minor role in the diagnosis of renal infection. Their main application is in the diagnosis of renal cyst infections in patients with polycystic renal disease.,19182730,2009
Urology,Comparative efficacies of procalcitonin and conventional inflammatory markers for prediction of renal parenchymal inflammation in pediatric first urinary tract infection.,OBJECTIVES: To compare the reliability of procalcitonin (PCT) with conventional laboratory parameters in predicting for renal parenchymal inflammation (RPI).METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 57 children who were admitted for a first-episode urinary tract infection. All patients underwent measurement of the leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum PCT. RPI was evaluated by technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy within 7 days of admission. If the first DMSA findings were abnormal, another analysis was performed 6 months later. The cutoff points for ESR, CRP, and PCT were established by comparing the areas under their receiver operating characteristic curves. Statistical analysis was performed using 1-way analysis of variance.RESULTS: Of the 57 children, 27 were diagnosed with RPI on the basis of positive DMSA results. The ESR, CRP, and PCT levels were significantly greater (P &lt; .001) in the patients with RPI than in those without RPI. In contrast, the leukocyte count was the same in both groups (P &gt; .05). PCT was a more sensitive and specific marker for differentiating upper and lower urinary tract infection than ESR and CRP. Persistent lesions at the site of previous RPI were found in 12 patients in the follow-up DMSA analysis, with total regression evident in the remaining 15. The PCT levels were significantly greater in those with persistent renal lesions than in those with total regression (P = .005).CONCLUSIONS: Serum PCT is a more reliable biologic marker than the ESR, CRP, or leukocyte count for the early prediction of RPI in children with a first episode of urinary tract infection. In addition, the greater the elevation of PCT at admission, the more positive the correlation for subsequent permanent renal damage.,19152962,2009
Ann Nucl Med,Renal cortical involvement in children with first UTI: does it differ in the presence of primary VUR?,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphic patterns in children with first symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI).METHODS: A total of 45 children with the diagnosis of first symptomatic UTI (28 girls, 17 boys, mean age 18 months, range 1 month-11 years) were reviewed. All DMSA scans were obtained within 2 months of bacteriologically proven UTI (median 21 days, mean 26 +/- 21, 14). After the exclusion of the patients with bilateral cortical lesions, 82 renal units were analyzed. The scintigraphic patterns included regional and global description of renal cortical abnormality (normal or decreased differential renal function, regional renal function (RRF), and the number and severity of cortical lesions).RESULTS: Vesicoureteral reflux was detected in 26 (32%) renal units (15 with grade 1-2, 11 with grade 3-4). Renal cortical abnormality was observed in 10 renal units without VUR (10/56, 17%) and 13 renal units with VUR (13/26: 50%). Of the 15 renal units, 5 with grade 1-2 VUR (5/15) and 8 of the 11 renal units with grade 3-4 VUR (8/11) had renal cortical involvement. The most common scintigraphic pattern in the patients without VUR was the preserved RRF (&gt;or=45%) and two or fewer photon-deficient areas. On the other hand, a decreased RRF (&lt;45) associated with cortical lesions was the most frequent finding in patients with refluxing kidneys (8/26, 30%), especially in those with grade 3-4 disease.CONCLUSIONS: This investigation showed that the presence of VUR affects DMSA patterns in children with first symptomatic UTI.,19142706,2009
Scott Med J,Renal power Doppler ultrasound does not predict renal scarring after urinary tract infection.,OBJECTIVE: Young children may develop renal scarring following a urinary tract infection (UTI) especially after pyelonephritis which is difficult to diagnose. Permanent renal scars are diagnosed by dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scan several months later. To decrease unnecessary exposure to radiation, we investigate the role of renal power Doppler (RPD) in predicting those who may not require a late DMSA scan.METHODS: Children under four years of age with a first UTI underwent an RPD study soon after diagnosis, and a DMSA scintigraphy six months later. The predictive values of the early RPD to detect DMSA renal scarring were calculated.RESULTS: Twenty three children (median age 30 months) were enrolled: 13 had a febrile presentation, two with bacteraemia. Permanent scarring occurred in three children (13%). In the 46 kidney units studied, initial RPD was abnormal in two and late DMSA abnormal in three units. Overall concordance between RPD and DMSA was 93.5%. The sensitivity of RPD for renal scar as per DMSA was 33.3%, specificity 97.7%; positive predictive value 50% and a negative predictive value of 95.4%.CONCLUSIONS: RPD offered no advantage over ultrasound to predict renal scarring and cannot be recommended to predict renal scarring following UTI.,19051656,2008
Pediatr Nephrol,Antenatal renal pelvis dilatation: 2-year follow-up with DMSA scintigraphy.,The aim of this study was to determine whether a postnatal ultrasound (US) can detect infants with antenatal renal pelvis dilatation (ARPD) who run a minimal risk of renal damage 2 years after birth. The study cohort consisted of 14,000 pregnant women who consecutively underwent routine US examinations during the second trimester. Subsequent examinations were performed on the basis of obstetrical indications. In total, 106 foetuses were diagnosed with ARPD &gt; or =5 mm. Two postnatal US were performed on the newborns: on postpartum days 5-7 and during the third week of life. The findings were considered to be normal when the renal pelvis diameter (RPD) was &lt; or = 7 mm and when there was no calyceal or ureteric dilatation or signs of renal dysplasia or other anomalies. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was done at 6-8 weeks after birth. When the children reached 2 years of age, renal status was evaluated with DMSA scintigraphy or, if not possible, US. In 53 of the 103 children available for evaluation, the postnatal US findings were normal; 49 of the 53 children were also given a DMSA, and the results were normal in all cases. An US scan (all normal) only was performed in three children because the families refused a DMSA. One family refused any form of examination at the 2-year follow-up. Based on our results, we conclude that postnatal US can detect infants who do not require follow-up assessments of renal development.,19002723,2008
Ann Nucl Med,Impact of micturating cystourethrography and DMSA renal scintigraphy on the investigation scheme in children with urinary tract infection.,OBJECTIVE: The relationships among urinary tract infection (UTI), vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and permanent renal damage in children are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of renal scarring in children with a history of UTI and to determine the change in the probability of permanent renal damage owing to the presence of VUR documented on micturating cystourethrography (MCU).METHODS: We analyzed 201 children (400 renal units, two children with solitary kidney). Seventy-four boys and 127 girls (aged 7 months to 7 years, median 2.5 years) with culture verified UTI were referred for technetium-labeled dimercaptosuccinic (DMSA) renal scintigraphy 4-6 months after acute UTI. MCU was also performed mostly 1 month prior to DMSA. Statistical analysis was performed using chi2 test or Fisher's exact test. Likelihood ratio (LR) positive and negative, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and post-test probability of (no) disease were calculated for VUR on MCU versus scarring on DMSA.RESULTS: Vesicoureteral reflux was found in 158 (39.5%) kidneys, and evaluated as grades I, II, III, IV, and V in 3, 70, 43, 25, and 17 refluxing renal units (RRU), respectively. Permanent renal damage according to DMSA was seen in 15.2% (61/400) kidneys. Scarring was shown in 29.7% (47/158) of kidneys with VUR and in 5.8% (14/242) kidneys without VUR (P&lt;0.0001). LR positive was 2.353 (95% CI 1.889, 2.865), LR negative 0.341 (95% CI 0.209, 0.523), and DOR 6.895 (95% CI 3.533, 14.093). Rate of scarring significantly increased with VUR of grades III, IV, and V. There was no significant difference in the incidence of scarring in kidneys without VUR and RRU with low-grade (I and II) VUR (P=0.306). The presence of VUR on MCU increased the chance of renal damage on DMSA by about 15%, whereas negative MCU increased the chance of no-renal involvement by 9%.CONCLUSIONS: Micturating cystourethrography should not be used as a first-line test to rule out the permanent renal damage owing to UTI. The priority of imaging strategy should be focused on early identification of renal lesions to prevent further deterioration.,18982468,2008
Int Urol Nephrol,Procalcitonin for the early prediction of renal parenchymal involvement in children with UTI: preliminary results.,In order to establish the most reliable marker for distinguishing urinary tract infections (UTI) with and without renal parenchymal involvement (RPI), we recorded the clinical features and admission leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum procalcitonin (PCT) in 57 children (including 43 girls) aged 2-108 months admitted with a first episode of UTI. RPI was evaluated by Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy within 7 days of admission. To establish cut-off points for ESR, CRP, and PCT, we used receiver operating characteristics curves and compared the area under the curve for ESR, CRP, and PCT. Twenty-seven children were diagnosed as having RPI based on positive renal scintigraphy. A body temperature of &gt;38 degrees C, a history of diarrhea, and poor oral intake were more common in patients with RPI. ESR, CRP, and PCT, but not leukocyte count, were significantly higher in patients with RPI (P &lt; 0.001). PCT was more sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of upper versus lower UTI than ESR and CRP. Using a cut-off value of 0.85 ng/ml, PCT had the best performance, with sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 89%, 97%, 96%, and 91% respectively. Serum PCT is a better marker than ESR, CRP, and leukocyte count for the early prediction of RPI in children with a first episode of UTI.,18836845,2008
Pediatr Nephrol,The risk factors of recurrent urinary tract infection in infants with normal urinary systems.,Urinary tract infection (UTI) frequently recurs and increases the risk of renal scarring even in infants with normal urinary tracts. Our study was aimed to find preventive measures for recurrent UTI in these infants. One-hundred ninety infants, who were diagnosed with their first febrile UTI and were proven to have normal urinary systems, were enrolled. We investigated the incidence of recurrent UTI during the following year and the following risk factors: gender, young age, phimosis, vaginal reflux, and acute pyelonephritis (APN) diagnosed by 99m-technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA)(+) scintigraphy. The incidence of recurrent UTI was 21.1%. The difference in recurrence rate according to gender was not significant. The recurrence rate in infants less than 6 months of age was 25.8%, which was significantly higher than the 7.7% in older infants (P = 0.045). In male infants with persistent non-retractile prepuces, recurrent UTI developed in 34.0%, which was significantly higher than the 17.6% in male infants with retractile prepuces (P = 0.022). The presence of APN in male infants increased the likelihood of recurrent UTI when analyzed by multivariate logistic regression [odds ratio 4.6, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.6-13.0, P = 0.003]. The presence of vaginal reflux and APN in female infants gave no significant difference to the incidence of recurrent UTI. In infants with normal urinary systems, age less than 6 months, non-retractile prepuces and APN in male infants, were the most important risk factors for recurrent UTIs. It is suggested that non-retractile prepuces should be adequately treated to become retractile in young male infants with APN.,18830717,2008
Eur Radiol,Value of comprehensive renal ultrasound in children with acute urinary tract infection for assessment of renal involvement: comparison with DMSA scintigraphy and final diagnosis.,The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of comprehensive renal ultrasound (US), i.e., combining greyscale US and amplitude-coded color Doppler sonography (aCDS), for assessment of urinary tract infection (UTI) in infants and children, compared to (1) (99m)Tc DMSA scintigraphy and (2) final diagnosis. Two hundred eighty-seven children with UTI underwent renal comprehensive US and DMSA scintigraphy. The results were compared with regard to their reliability to diagnose renal involvement, using (1) DMSA scintigraphy and (2) final diagnosis as the gold standard. Sixty-seven children clinically had renal involvement. Sensitivity increased from 84.1% using only aCDS to 92.1% for the combined US approach, using DMSA scintigraphy as the reference standard. When correlated with the final diagnosis, sensitivity for DMSA scintigraphy was 92.5%; sensitivity for comprehensive US was 94.0%. Our data demonstrate an increasing sensitivity using the combination of renal greyscale US supplemented by aCDS for differentiation of upper from lower UTI. Sensitivity for DMSA and comprehensive US was similar for both methods compared to the final diagnosis. Comprehensive US should gain a more important role in the imaging algorithm of children with acute UTI, thereby reducing the radiation burden.,18641996,2008
Cir Pediatr,[Prognostic value of the ultrasound and diuretic renogram in the evolution of ureteropelvic junction obstruction].,INTRODUCTION: The congenital obstruction of the pieloureteral junction (UPJ) is the most frequent cause of hydronephrosis in children. Sometimes, establishing the convenience of a surgical procedure is difficult, mainly if we consider the literature published on the spontaneous resolution of the slight, moderate and even severe hydronephrosis in newborns.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prognostic value of ultrasound in the evolution of the unilateral hydronephrosis, by assesing the size of the contralateral kidney. To verify if the &quot;supranormal&quot; renal function (SRF) is real or an artefact.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have performed a descriptive observational study over a 10 years period (1995-2005). The study included all patients with the only diagnosis of obstructive unilateral hydronephrosis that underwent pieloplasty, and were controlled for 1 year period after the surgical treatment.RESULTS: Of the 66 patients in the study, 42 were boys (63.6%) and 24 girls (36.4%). After the first diuretic renogram (DR), in 57 of the patients (86.4%) the clearance half-time (T1/2) was over 20 minutes, in 6 cases (9.1%) it was 10-20 minutes and only in 3 cases it was shorter than 10 minutes. A similar differential renal function (FRD) was observed in the moderate and severe hydronephrosis. Supranormal function (FRD &gt; 52%) was detected on DR in 11 patients, predominating in left hidronefrosis, and in more than 50% of the cases this value it did not agree with the renal function measured by dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA), Pearson's correlation coefficient: 0.19. These kidneys experienced a greater reduction of the postoperative renal function.CONCLUSIONS: In the unilateral obstructive hydronephrosis, the healthy contralateral kidney experiences hypertrophy detectable by ultrasound, but these ecographic diameters are within the band of individual confidence of the healthy children of reference. The supranormal function exists, but in most cases it is an artefact.,18624271,2008
Vojnosanit Pregl,Renal scintigraphy in infants with antenatally diagnosed renal pelvis dilatation.,AIM: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux are the most frequent entities identified on the basis of antenatal hydronephrosis. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and pattern of abnormal renal scintigraphy findings in postnatal investigation of children with antenatal hydronephrosis.METHODS: Twenty-four infants (19 boys and five girls) presented with antenatal hydronephrosis and mild to moderate hydronephrosis on ultrasound in newborn period were referred for renal scintigraphy. Ten patients with vesicoureteral reflux documented on micturating cystoureterography underwent 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy and 14 patients were subjected to 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy.RESULTS: Anteroposterior pelvic diameter on ultrasound ranged from 11 to 24 mm. Renal DMSA scans identified congenital scars in two boys with bilateral reflux of grade V and unilateral reflux of grade III. Relative kidney uptake (RKU) less than 40% was found in three, and poor kidney function (RKU less than 10%) in two patients. Significant obstruction was shown on DTPA diuretic renal scintigraphy in 6/14 patients. Some slowing in dranaige (T1/2 greater than 10 minutes) with no reduction in differential renal function was identified in three patients. Differential renal function less than 10% was obtained in one case.CONCLUSION: A high percent of abnormal renal scintigraphy findings was obtained. Renal scintigraphy was useful in determination of underlying cause of antenatally detected hydronephrosis.,18499951,2008
Arch Esp Urol,[Imaging techniques and vesicoureteral reflux].,OBJECTIVES: Although vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a very frequent pathology in the pediatric age and represents an important part of the activity of pediatricians, pediatric urologists, nephrologists, and radiologists, yet there is controversy about its global management both in diagnosis and treatment. The objective of this paper is to perform an update in the use of different imaging techniques in the diagnosis and followup of VUR and to propose a work up protocol.METHODS: We describe the imaging techniques: VCUG, ultrasound, intravenous urography, bladder-ultrasound, DMSA, MRI, and their role in the evaluation and followup of VUR. We performed a bibliographic review about the topic and present the experience of our working group on VUR.RESULTS: The bibliographic review shows a clear evolution of the concepts of VUR and also the management algorithms. The concepts of congenital renal lesion without urinary tract infection (UTI) or acquired lesion after UTI are clearly differentiated in the most recent reviews. Reflux is passing from being the center of the problem to a secondary phenomenon in relation to UTI, and this is leading to a change of diagnostic strategy, less and less invasive.CONCLUSIONS: VCUG has been to date the first and indisputable technique for the management of VUR, mainly in the diagnostic phase, but technological advances in the area of ultrasound (ultrasound contrasts, harmonic image, etc.) have converted ultrasound in the first imaging technique for the management of VUR in pediatric age. On the other hand, work-up algorithms have changed due to the great impact prenatal diagnosis is having in the management of urinary tract anomalies.,18491728,2008
Srp Arh Celok Lek,[Vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring].,Reflux nephropathy is an acquired focal renal scarring due to the combination of vesicoureteral (VUR) and intrarenal reflux (IRR) associated with urinary tract infections (IUT) and/or permanently high intravesical pressure. Up to 30-60% of children with VUR and a history of symptomatic IUT have renal scarring at the time of their initial studies. The onset of renal scarring usually occurs early in life, usually before age five years and most frequently before three years of age. Girls are at greater risk for developing reflux nephropathy, because of increased incidence of IUT. Reflux nephropathy is different from a diffuse congenital renal scarring (hypo-dysplasia), which is usually discovered antenatally or during infancy in boys with severe VUR. Without serial follow-up (ultrasonography, intravenous pyelourography, 99mTc-DMSA scan) from birth, it is not always possible to differentiate congenital renal scarring from reflux nephropathy. In contrast to reflux nephropathy, congenital renal scarring cannot be prevented. 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy is the gold standard technique (sensitivity 92%, specificity 98%) for the diagnosis of reflux nephropathy, but ultrasound is a good modality to monitor kidney growth over time. Reflux nephropathy and hypodysplasia are the main causes of chronic renal failure and arterial hypertension in children and adolescents in our country. The long-term follow-up of children with reflux nephropathy is mandatory, since its complications may take 10 to 20 years to develop. Uncontrollable arterial hypertension and proteinuria are the predictors of poor prognosis. The selective use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers is the efficient antihypertensive therapy, which also modify intrarenal haemodynamics and can preserve renal function.,18368911,2008
Nephrology (Carlton),Primary vesicoureteral reflux mediated renal scarring after urinary tract infection in Thai children.,AIM: To evaluate the association between primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and renal scarring in children using 99 m Technetium-labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).METHODS: Children attending at Songklanagarind Hospital from 1987 to 2002 were evaluated.RESULTS: Ages at diagnosis of VUR in 46 boys and 52 girls were 1.1+/-1.6 and 2.9+/-2.5 years, median 0.6 and 2.3 years, respectively (P&lt;0.001). DMSA scans were performed at 4.1+/-3.6 years. Renal parenchymal damage was detected in 34 kidneys (22%) of 154 demonstrated refluxing ureters, and one kidney (2%) of 42 non-refluxing ureters (P=0.002). Of 79 refluxing ureters in boys and 75 refluxing ureters in girls, there were 25 and nine renal scars, respectively (32% and 12%, P=0.003). Renal scars in VUR grades I-V were 11%, 7%, 12%, 44% and 64%, respectively (P&lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that high grade VUR (P&lt;0.001), age of diagnosis of VUR greater than 5 years (P=0.001), and male gender (P=0.002) were the most significant risk factors for renal scarring.CONCLUSION: High-grade VUR, age of diagnosis of VUR greater than 5 years and male gender were the most significant risk factors for renal scarring.,18199100,2008
J Pediatr,Normal dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy makes voiding cystourethrography unnecessary after urinary tract infection.,OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that infants with dilating vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) have abnormal acute dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy results, as was suggested by an earlier retrospective study.STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective study of infants &lt;1 year old with first diagnosed symptomatic urinary tract infection at the Children's Hospital of Göteborg, Sweden. Two hundred ninety consecutive children (161 boys and 129 girls) with complete records were examined. Renal ultrasound scanning and DMSA scintigraphy were performed within a few days from diagnosis, and VCU was performed within 2 months.RESULTS: VUR was found in 52 children, of which 27 had dilating VUR (grade III-V). DMSA scintigraphy results were abnormal in 149 infants (51%), 105 of 238 (44%) without VUR, 18 of 25 (72%) with VUR grade I to II, and 26 of 27 (96%) with VUR grade III to V (P &lt;.001).CONCLUSION: DMSA scintigraphy results were abnormal in all 27 infants with dilating VUR except 1. This single false-negative finding should be compared with 140 unnecessary VCU investigations. This supports our hypothesis that DMSA scintigraphy results are abnormal when there is dilating VUR. Thus, a normal DMSA scan makes VCU unnecessary in the primary examination of infants with UTI.,18035134,2007
Pediatr Nephrol,Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in the evaluation of hypertension in children.,Renal scarring is known to be associated with hypertension. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of renal scarring in children referred to our clinic with hypertension. The secondary objective was to compare renal ultrasound (US) examination with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in diagnosing renal scars in these patients. The study included 159 patients who underwent DMSA renal scan as well as renal US for the evaluation of hypertension of unknown etiology. Thirty-three (21%) patients were found to have renal scars; their demographic details, including mean age and gender distribution, were not significantly different from those without renal scars. In comparison with the DMSA renal scan, sensitivity and specificity of renal US in diagnosing renal scars were 36% and 94%, respectively. In our study, in which the prevalence of scarring was 21%, this gave positive predictive and negative predictive values of 63% and 85%, respectively. In conclusion, our study indicates that renal scarring is present in 21% of otherwise healthy children who are evaluated for newly diagnosed hypertension, and renal US is not a sensitive imaging modality to rule out renal scarring.,18026997,2007
Pediatr Nephrol,Risk factors for renal scarring in children and adolescents with lower urinary tract dysfunction.,Risk factors for renal scarring in children with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) were evaluated. The medical records of 120 patients were assessed concerning gender, presence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), bladder capacity, detrusor overactivity, residual urine, febrile urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteriuria, constipation, detrusor sphincter incoordination (DSI), high detrusor pressure at maximal cystometric capacity (PMCC), low compliance, and thickness and trabeculation of the bladder wall. Renal scarring was diagnosed by (99m)technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan (DMSA). Renal scarring was detected in 38 patients (31%). VUR, UTI, decreased bladder capacity, urinary residue, and trabeculated and thick bladder wall were associated with scarring at univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed VUR (P &lt; 0.0001) as the independent risk factor for renal scarring. Thickness of the bladder wall was a marginal risk factor (P = 0.07). Although UTI was not a risk factor, it was associated with VUR (P = 0.03). In our analysis, VUR was the main risk factor; however, renal scarring was probably due to multifactorial causes, as VUR was associated with UTI.,17874252,2007
Pediatr Radiol,Uncomplicated duplex kidney and DMSA scintigraphy in children with urinary tract infection.,BACKGROUND: Renal duplication is the most common malformation of the urinary tract and is frequently seen among children with urinary tract infection (UTI).OBJECTIVE: To evaluate problems in the interpretation of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy and to establish the range of relative function in uncomplicated unilateral duplication.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 303 children less than 2 years of age with first time non-obstructive urinary tract infection investigated by both urography and DMSA scintigraphy. At DMSA scintigraphy, renal lesions and/or relative function below 45% was considered abnormal. Urography was used as reference for the diagnosis of duplication.RESULTS: Duplex kidneys were found in 22 of 303 patients (7%). Of the 16 children with unilateral duplication, 10 had bilaterally undamaged kidneys with a range of relative function varying between 51% and 57% in the duplex kidney. In two of the children with unilateral duplication the imaging results were discordant.CONCLUSION: There was risk of underdiagnosis as well as overdiagnosis of renal damage at scintigraphy. Although it is important to be aware of this risk, the rate of misinterpretation was low. A range of 51% to 57% can be used as the limit for normality of the relative function of a unilateral duplex kidney.,17593362,2007
Urol J,Technetium Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy in diagnosis of urinary tract infections in children with negative culture.,INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of Technetium Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children with suspected infection but with a negative urine culture.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of all children with suspected or definite diagnosis of UTI presented during a 2-year period were reviewed in this study. Abnormal findings on renal scintigraphy, voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), and ultrasonography were evaluated and compared between the patients with the definite diagnosis of UTI and those with suspected UTI and negative urine cultures.RESULTS: Of 210 patients, 86 had a definite diagnosis of UTI (group 1) and 124 had suspected UTI without a positive culture (group 2). Abnormal findings on DMSA scans were seen in 76 patients (88.4%) in group 1 and 84 (67.7%) in group 2. Vesicoureteral reflux was detected by VCUG in 50% and 32.3% of the patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively. In group 2, vesicoureteral reflux was seen in 40.5% of the patients with abnormal DMSA scan. Ultrasonography findings were abnormal in 51.3% and 39.8% of the patients with abnormal DMSA scan findings in groups 1 and 2, respectively.CONCLUSION: According to our findings, in children with a negative urine culture and abnormal urinalysis, 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy is helpful in diagnosing UTI and vesicoureteral reflux; we recommend VCUG when DMSA scan supports UTI despite a negative urine culture and a normal ultrasonography.,17559029,2007
Semin Nucl Med,Renal infection and vesico-ureteric reflux.,Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease of childhood. The investigation of UTI in children has been the subject of debate and controversy for many years. Most workers agree that the first imaging modality to be used should be an ultrasound examination to exclude obstruction, structural abnormalities, and renal calculi. The role of (99m)Tc dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is becoming increasingly important. Many argue that if the DMSA study is normal at the time of acute UTI, no further investigation is required because the kidneys have not been involved and thus there will be no late sequelae. Others use the acute DMSA study to determine the intensity of antibiotic therapy. The importance of the role of vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) is being debated. Some workers will only proceed to cystography to detect VUR if the DMSA study is abnormal, whereas others advocate a more aggressive approach. VUR can be identified by a variety of radiological and scintigraphic techniques. Although the radiological cystogram is the gold standard and is essential in the first UTI in a male patient, to exclude the presence of posterior urethral valves, radionuclide cystograms are advantageous in other situations. Suprapubic cystography techniques have been described to overcome the trauma of urethral catheterization but have not been widely accepted.,17544626,2007
J Nucl Med Technol,Inter- and intraobserver variability of (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy: impact of oblique views.,METHODS: Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians independently interpreted 100 (99m)Tc-DMSA scans (197 kidneys) 4 times. Interpretation was twice based on posterior projection images and twice based on posterior and posterior oblique projection images. For each kidney, the observers had to choose between the following results: normal, abnormal, and indeterminate. The indices of variability used were the percentage of agreement, kappa-statistic, and marginal homogeneity.RESULTS: Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility (kappa-values) varied between 0.683 and 0.708 and between 0.609 and 0.671, respectively, for posterior images. Disagreement in (99m)Tc-DMSA scan interpretation occurred in 18% of kidneys within observers and in 21% of kidneys between observers when only posterior images were used. Oblique views changed the interpretation in 14% and 11.5% of kidneys for the first and second observers, respectively. The use of oblique views increased the agreement rate within and between observers (kappa-values, 0.725-0.812 and 0.768-0.732, respectively; mean agreement, 86.5 and 87.25, respectively).CONCLUSION: Oblique views were found useful in approximately 13% of kidneys and affected inter- and intraobserver variability. Our results suggest that oblique views should be used routinely in children with clinically suspected urinary tract infection to reliably interpret images.,17496008,2007
Pediatr Nephrol,Diagnostic significance of clinical and laboratory findings to localize site of urinary infection.,The aim of this study was to define in children younger than 2 years of age the diagnostic significance of clinical and laboratory findings to localize site of febrile urinary tract infection. We reviewed the records of 185 children younger than 2 years of age admitted to hospital with febrile urinary tract infection. Patients were divided into having either acute pyelonephritis or acute cystitis according to the presence or absence of acute lesions on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy. Clinical and laboratory [white blood cell count (WBC), urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP)] findings were compared between the two groups using Student's t test, chi-square test, and multivariate analysis. Patients with pyelonephritis had statistically significant higher age, WBC, ESR, and CRP than those with cystitis. Although the sensitivity of the tests was 80-100%, their specificity was &lt;28%. On multivariate analysis, 33% of patients with cystitis were diagnosed as having pyelonephritis, whereas 22% of those with pyelonephritis were considered to have cystitis. Given the low specificity of clinical findings and available laboratory tests to define the site of urine infection in this age group, we recommend DMSA renal scintigram as the test of choice to make the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in these patients.,17375337,2007
Turk J Pediatr,DMSA findings in the evaluation of pediatric renal allograft.,Owing to their minimally invasive nature, efficiency and availability, radionuclide renal diagnostic studies play an important role in assessing renal transplant function. Various quantitative parameters have been derived from the radionuclide renograms in the follow-up to assess changes in perfusion and function of the transplant kidneys. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in renal transplants with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. Serial cortical renal scans of 66 patients were reviewed retrospectively. The studies were analyzed regarding the quality of the images and morphology of the kidneys. Cortical renal scintigraphy was unable to provide decisive information for the etiological diagnosis of renal graft dysfunction, thus not allowing a distinction to be made between different clinical situations. Despite being non-specific, it gives information that is not apparent on conventional imaging as well as the extent of pathology, which makes it a sensitive test in the follow-up of transplant pediatric patients. An early scan within the first weeks provides a baseline, which may help in the assessment of future complications.,17290567,2007
Urologe A,[Pelvic kidney in childhood. Specific features, concomitant pathologies and useful diagnostic investigations].,In a retrospective analysis we studied the case histories of 31 children who had been seen in our department for investigation of pelvic ectopic kidney between January 1994 and June 2005. The evaluation of each involved the medical history, ultrasound examination, VCUG, and DMSA scan or MAG3 diuresis renogram. Of the 31 children, 21 (67.7%) had initially been referred to our department for further investigation and clarification because renal agenesis was suspected. In the remaining 10 (32.3%) children the pelvic kidney was an incidental finding observed during investigation of various other conditions. Overall, 7 (22.6%) of the 31 were symptomatic (recurrent urinary tract infections, abdominal pain, hypertension, hydronephrosis), while 77.4% (24/31) were completely free of symptoms at the time of follow-up. Ultrasound revealed that the ectopic kidney was on the left in 64.5% (20/31) of these cases. Nuclear scans performed both at the time of the initial diagnosis and at follow-up were available for 11 of the 31 children and showed a mild improvement of the partial function of the pelvic kidney, from a mean of 25.6% to a mean of 34.6%. In conclusion, whenever renal agenesis is suspected on ultrasonographic examination, the investigator should first consider renal ectopia; ultrasound examination with the bladder full is the definitive diagnostic procedure. For asymptomatic cases we recommend regular ultrasound monitoring of the kidney -- at first every 6 months and later once a year. In cases with complex anatomy MRI is a suitable method for further diagnostic work-up.,17221248,2007
Rev Esp Med Nucl,[Evaluation of renal lesions using 99mTc-DMSA in children with urinary tract infection and the relation with vesicoureteral reflux].,OBJECTIVE: Paediatric patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) have risk of developing renal scarrings. Although it is known that vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) predisposes to UTIs and it seems to have an important role in the development of renal lesions, some recent published studies question that relation. The aim of the study was to evaluate renal scarring by using renal scintigraphy 99mTc-DMSA and see the relation with or without the presence of VUR.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated retrospectively a total of 230 patients (460 renal units), mean age: 11 months (range: 12d-5y), with UTI probed by urinoculture. All were studied with voiding cistourethrography (MCU) to evaluate the presence or absence of VUR. Patients were evaluated with 99mTc-DMSA scan 6 months after UTI to determine if UTI caused renal scarring.RESULTS: Renal scans with 99mTc-DMSA 6 months post-infection were abnormal in 62 renal units, affecting 54 patients (23 %). From all patients studied, 110 were diagnosis of VUR being affected 161 renal units, 43 of them (27 %) presented renal scarrings. From the remaining 120 patients without VUR that is 240 renal units, 19 of them (8 %) presented parenchymatous damage.CONCLUSION: Renal scarring resulting from UTI are in some cases related to VUR, but sometimes are caused by the infection itself. Not all patients with VUR develop renal lesions, and neither the presence of VUR always predispose children to renal lesions. MCU and direct isotopic cystography are useful for diagnosis of VUR but we shouldn't avoid 99mTc-DMSA scan in the management of children with UTI.,17173786,2006
J Med Assoc Thai,The relation of vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring in childhood urinary tract infection.,OBJECTIVE: Assess the relation of age and sex in vesico ureteral reflux (VUR) and renal scarring and the relation of VUR and renal scarring in childhood urinary tract infection.MATERIAL AND METHOD: A descriptive study of one hundred and twenty-six children who received renal cortical scintigraphy from 1st Jan 2000 to 31st Dec 2004 in the Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, was conducted. Ninety-three (50 males, 43 females) patients were diagnosed with urinary tract infections (UTIs) but only ninety-one of them had renal cortical scintigraphic results available. The male to female ratio was 1.16:1. The mean age of the patients was 4.33 years (SD +/- 4.17, range 7 days-16 years). During the 1st year of life the male to female ratio is 2.6:1. Fever, dysuria, and poor feeding were the most presenting signs and symptoms. Eighty-five (45 males, 40 females) patients received Voiding Cysto Urethro Gram (VCUG).RESULT: The authors did not find the correlation between the age groups and sex with VCUG results on right and left side, respectively (p = 0.856, p = 0.145, p = 0.77, p = 0.75). Ninety-one (49 males, 42 females) patients received DMSA renal scintigraphy. Fifty-two patients (57.1%) had abnormal DMSA renal scan results. However; the authors did not find the correlation between age groups and sex with DMSA renal scan results on the right and left kidneys, respectively. (p = 0.202, p = 0.416, p = 0.511, p = 0.791). The authors compared times of UTIs with and DMSA renal scintigraphy in each side of the kidney. Even though the authors did find the correlation between episodes of UTIs and abnormal DMSA on the left kidneys (p = 0.017), it was not found on the right kidneys (p = 0.081). There were 80 patients who received both VCUG and DMSA renal scintigraphy. The authors found the correlation between severity of VUR and abnormal DMSA results on right and left kidneys (p = 0.001, p = 0.01).CONCLUSION: The authors recommend that all children who have repeated UTI and/or VUR, irrespective of age and sex, should receive DMSA renal scintigraphy to detect renal scarring and follow up future complications.,17044453,2006
Pediatr Nephrol,Power Doppler sonographic evaluation of acute childhood pyelonephritis.,Urinary tract infection is common in children. The available gold standard methods for diagnosis, Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and computed tomography (CT) are invasive and expensive. This study was performed to assess the role of power Doppler ultrasound (PDU) for diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) compared with Tc-99m DMSA scan. A prospective study was conducted in 34 children with the mean age of 2.8+/-2.7 years who were hospitalized with the first episode of febrile urinary tract infection. All children were examined in the first 3 days of admission by PDU and Tc-99m DMSA scan. Patients with congenital structural anomaly were excluded. Each kidney was divided into three zones. The comparison between PDU and DMSA scan was performed on the basis of patients and renal units. According to the patient's number, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of PDU were 89%, 53%, 70%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, but based on the renal units, changed to 66%, 81%, 46%, 91%, and 79%, respectively. Although PDU has the potential for identifying APN in children, it is still soon to replace DMSA scan.,17024392,2006
Przegl Lek,[Birth weight and hypertension (HT) in children with reflux nephropathy (RN)].,Low birth weight (bw) has been related to low nephron number and hypertension. Age is an important predictor of developing hypertension in patients with reflux nephropathy (RN). The aim of the study was to assess the relationships between birth weight and blood pressure in children with RN. We investigated 150 patients in mean age 9 +/- 3.3 years with vesicoureteral reflux. In all patients we collected birth weight, we also performed renal scintigraphy (DMSA) and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Standard deviation score body mass index (BMI SDS) was calculated. In ABPM mean value of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sBP, dBP), blood pressure load during 24 hour and during day and nighttime (LsBP, LdBP) were analyzed. As objective parameters of BP in children in different age and hight, systolic and diastolic BP indices (sBPI, dBPI) were calculated.</AbstractText>: Low birth weight (bw) has been related to low nephron number and hypertension.

As objective parameters of BP in children in different age and hight, systolic and diastolic BP indices (sBPI, dBPI) were calculated.RESULTS: In analyzed group of children mean bw was 3340 +/- 587 g (from 1300 to 5000 g); in 10 children bw was &lt;2500 g. In 20 children (13%), in 3 with bw &lt;2500 g (30%) and in 17 (12.5%) with normal bw hypertension was diagnosed. The mean age and BMI SDS were lower in children with bw &lt; 2500 g and HT than in children with normal bw and HT (8.2 vs 9.9 years and median -0.53 vs -0.22 respectively). In children with HT mean bw was 3247 +/- 666 g and in children without HT 3293 +/- 461 g (NS). No statistically significant difference was found depends of grades of renal damage in DMSA scan for bw. The negative correlation was found between bw and sBPI, LsBP during 24h and sBPI i LsBP during nighttime (p&lt;0.05 r=-20, p&lt;0.05 r=-19; p&lt;0.05 r=-16, p&lt;0.01 r=-26 respectively). No correlation was found between bw and dBP values.CONCLUSION: In children with RN low bw may be a potential risk factor for developing hypertension independent of severity of renal scarring.,16898505,2006
Nucl Med Commun,Accurate diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis: How helpful is procalcitonin?,AIM: This prospective study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of serum procalcitonin levels in children with acute pyelonephritis documented by Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.METHODS: We compared the symptoms and laboratory findings of fever, vomiting, abdominal/flank pain, leukocyte count, serum C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels with the results of the DMSA scan obtained within the first 72 h after referral in children who were diagnosed as having acute pyelonephritis. Thirty-three children (31 female and two male) aged 1-11 years (mean 4.42 years) were enrolled in this prospective study.RESULTS: Twenty-one of 33 patients (64%) had positive DMSA scans. On the scans obtained after 6 months, five of 21 patients (23.8%) had renal scars. No correlation was found between clinical and laboratory parameters, alone or combined with each other, and positive DMSA scans. Serum procalcitonin levels were 0.767+/-0.64 and 1.23+/-1.17 ng . ml in children with normal and positive DMSA scans, respectively. The cut-off value for procalcitonin using receiver operating characteristic analysis was 0.9605 ng . ml, while sensitivity and specificity were 86.4% and 36.4%, respectively. However, if the cut-off value was chosen as 2 ng . ml, the sensitivity increased to 100% while specificity did not change markedly.CONCLUSION: The serum procalcitonin test, like other commonly used laboratory parameters, e.g. serum C-reactive protein and white blood cell count, was inadequate in distinguishing renal parenchymal involvement in acute febrile urinary tract infections.,16894326,2006
Nucl Med Rev Cent East Eur,Results of a five-year study of 99mTc DMSA renal scintigraphy in children and adolescents following acute pyelonephritis.,BACKGROUND: Renal scintigraphy, generally using 99mTc-DMSA, is the accepted reference standard for detection of renal cortical changes. The timing of the test, i.e., whether an acute 99mTc-DMSA scan, a follow-up only or both scans should be performed, however, remains open to discussion. In our study, a six-month follow- up DMSA scan was performed in all the children diagnosed with a first attack of acute pyelonephritis (APN) in two large paediatric clinics of Charles University's 3rd School of Medicine in Prague during a five-year period. All diagnoses were confirmed by a paediatric nephrologist.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 382 children (267 girls, 115 boys) aged between 7 months and 19 years were included in the study. For analytical purposes, the patients were divided into 4 age groups: I--less than 1 year of age, II--1-5 years, III--5-10 years, and IV--10-19 years. In all children younger than five years, a micturition cystourethrogram (MCUG) for detection of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was performed between one and three months after the APN episode. Static renal scintigraphy, using an HR collimator with parallel holes was performed using a planar Gamma camera MB 9200 (Gamma Budapest) in all children six months after APN, with a complement of pinhole images, SPECT or PSPECT of the kidneys.RESULTS: 1. In group I, all four children with positive VUR on MCUG had a pathological DMSA scan, while only two of the 32 patients with negative VUR had a pathological DMSA. 2. In group II, 17 children had VUR on MCUG, six of them with a pathological and 11 with a normal DMSA scan. Most of the 221 children without VUR had a normal DMSA scintigraphy; pathological findings were present in 17 children only. 3. In group III, all children with VUR, but only 5 out of 53 without VUR, had a pathological DMSA scan. 4. Five out of 50 children in group IV had a pathological DMSA.CONCLUSIONS: APN occurred most frequently in group II (62.3%, or 238 children) and ranged between 10-15% in the remaining groups. APN was found very frequently in boys less than one year old and showed a marked decrease with increasing age. Among girls, however, APN incidence was observed to increase with age. Pathological renal changes were present in children with, as well as without, VUR. The incidence of pathological DMSA findings six months after APN was relatively low (44/382 patients, or 11.5%). Regular monitoring of these children is very important for detection of renal scarring.,16791804,2006
J Appl Genet,Urological anomalies in children with renal agenesis or multicystic dysplastic kidney.,This study aimed to determine the frequency of associated urological abnormalities in children with unilateral renal agenesis (RA) or multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK). In total, 38 children (10 girls, 28 boys) were studied: 21 with RA and 17 with MCDK. In 14 children (37%) anomalies of the urinary tract were suspected prenatally in ultrasound studies. In the remaining 24 children the diagnosis of RA/MCDK was made postnatally: in 13 (34%) in the first 7 days of life, in 11 (29%) at the age of 8 days to 34 months, mean 10.6+/-8.05 months. Voiding cystourethrography was done in 36 (95%) children, the isotopic 99mTc-EC/DMSA scan of the kidney in 29 (67%), and urography in 8. Urological anomalies were present in 11 (29%) children: in 7 (33%) with RA and in 4 (24%) with MCDK. Vesicoureteral reflux was diagnosed in 8 children: grade II in 4, III in 3, and IV in 1 (in 1 child to duplicated, in 1 to ectopic kidney); ureterovesical junction obstruction in 2 (9.5%); and ureteropelvic junction obstruction in 1 (4.8%). Among them, 2 children demanded surgery on the contralateral urinary tract: pyeloplasty in 1, antireflux procedure in 1; while 9 children were treated conservatively. Compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney was found in 90% of children. Thus due to an increased risk of pathological changes in the single functioning kidney, lifelong nephrological care is recommended in patients with unilateral RA/MCDK.,16682760,2006
Turk J Pediatr,Urinary tract infection and hyperbilirubinemia.,The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in newborns with asymptomatic, unexplained indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the first two weeks of life. Jaundiced infants, otherwise clinically well, less than two weeks of ages, with a total bilirubin level above 15 mg/dl were eligible for the study. A bilirubin work-up including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6 PD) level, as well as urinalysis and a urine culture were performed in all patients. Patients with UTI, defined as more than 10,000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single pathogen obtained by bladder catheterization, were evaluated for sepsis. Renal function tests and renal ultrasound were performed in cases with UTI. During follow-up, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) were performed as well. A total of 102 patients were enrolled. The bilirubin work-up of patients did not demonstrate any significant underlying disorder. None of the infants had a high direct bilirubin level. UTI was diagnosed in eight (8%) cases [Enterobacter aerogenes (3/8:38%), Enterococcus faecalis (2/8:25%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2/8:25%) and Escherichia coli (1/8:12%)]. Of those eight patients, only four (50%) had pyuria. Bacteriuria was present in seven (88%) patients. The sepsis screen was negative in all but one case with a high C-reactive protein (CRP) level. None of the patients had a positive blood culture. Renal function tests were within normal levels in all patients. Renal ultrasound showed urinary tract abnormalities in three (38%) patients (hydronephrosis, n=1 and pelviectasis, n=2). VCUG was performed in all patients during the study period and one had unilateral grade 3-4 reflux, while only one patient had a diverticulum of the bladder. DMSA was performed in seven patients and none had renal scars. It is of importance that UTI can occur in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants even in the first week of life. Although it is well known that UTI is a common cause of prolonged jaundice, urine culture should be considered in the bilirubin work-up of infants older than three days of age with an unknown etiology.,16562786,2006
Int Urol Nephrol,The efficacy of Tc99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy and ultrasonography in detecting renal scars in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).,INTRODUCTION: Pyelonephritis-induced renal scarring in children is a major predisposing factor for proteinuria, hypertension, and ultimate renal failure. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of Tc99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy and renal ultrasonography (USG) in detecting renal scars in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tc-DMSA scan and USG studies were done in 62 children who were admitted to our clinic between 1997 and 2003 because of documented urinary tract infection (UTI) and diagnosed with primary VUR. Renal scarring detection rates of Tc-DMSA scan and USG were compared according to reflux grades.RESULTS: In the whole group, renal scars were detected by Tc-DMSA scan and USG in 55% and 38% of refluxing units, respectively. Detection rates of Tc-DMSA and USG according to reflux grades were as follows: 47% and 29 % in low-grade VUR (grades 1 and 2), 46 % and 25% in mid-grade VUR (grade 3), 76% and 65% in high-grade VUR (grades 4 and 5), respectively.CONCLUSION: USG was found to be an inappropriate study in the detection of renal parenchymal scars, irrespective of the reflux grade. In this study, Tc-DMSA scan detected scars in 35% of kidneys reported to be normal on USG.,16502071,2006
Abdom Imaging,Kidney length and scarring in children with urinary tract infection: importance of ultrasound scans.,BACKGROUND: Many studies have demonstrated that dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy is the most sensitive diagnostic method in the identification of irreversible renal lesions (scars) in children with previous episodes of acute pyelonephritis (APN). This study assessed the reliability of ultrasound in identifying reflux nephropathy in children with acute pyelonephritis with or without vesicoureteric reflux (VUR).METHODS: Eighty children (45 female and 35 male, age range 5 months to 10 years, average age 2 years 1 month) with a positive history for at least one episode of APN participated in this study. All children underwent voiding cystourethrography, DMSA scintigraphy 4 to 8 months after the most recent episode of APN, and an ultrasound test evaluation less than 2 months after DMSA scintigraphy.RESULTS: Voiding cystourethrograms showed VUR in 52 children (68%); 13 of these were bilateral, for a total of 65 refluxing kidney units of the 154 (42%) evaluated; DMSA scintigram was normal for 108 of 154 kidneys (70%). Of the 65 kidneys with VUR, DMSA scintigram displayed normal findings in 29 cases (45%) and pathologic findings in 36 (55%). In the 79 nonrefluxing kidneys, DMSA scintigram was normal in 69 cases (87%). The relative risk of scarring in VUR kidneys is 2.6. The ultrasound study recorded a maximum longitudinal diameter between the 5th and 95th percentiles in 80 of 89 (81%) kidneys without VUR and in 21 of 65 (32%) with VUR. A significant correlation was found between maximum longitudinal diameters and DMSA scintigraphic findings in kidneys with VUR and those without VUR, respectively.CONCLUSION: This study establishes that ultrasound scans, by means of a simple and reproducible measurement technique, maximum longitudinal diameter, have a predictive value with regard to the presence of scars, with few exceptions. This finding, in our opinion, could lead to a decrease in the number of invasive procedures, in particular DMSA scan, in patients with APN.,16252147,2005
Minerva Pediatr,Diagnostic workup of urinary tract infections within the first 24 months of life, in the era of prenatal diagnosis. The contribution of different imaging techniques to clinical management.,AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of different techniques in the diagnostic workup of children with negative prenatal ultrasonogram, referred for urinary tract infection (UTI) within the first 24 months.METHODS: One-hundred and forty-seven patients, 71 males/76 females were studied. All patients were submitted to renal ultrasonogram (RUS) and to micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) independently from the results of RUS. In a small group (48 children) DMSA scan was performed independently from the results of RUS and MCU. Sensitivity and predictive value of RUS for vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) were estimated. Multiple regression analysis was performed on a selected number of signs to evaluate their predictive value. The group investigated by DMSA scan was analysed to evaluate how the presence of VUR on MCU anticipated renal damage.RESULTS: Nineteen (21%) patients with normal RUS, had VUR. Predictive value of RUS (0.21) was influenced by the grade of the VUR but more than 30% of high grade refluxing renal units appeared normal at initial ultrasonography. DMSA scan was abnormal in 27% of 48 patients; its result was independent from the presence of VUR of whatever grade.CONCLUSIONS: The increasing number of renal abnormalities detected before birth reduces the possibility of late abnormal RUS findings. It makes RUS screening for abnormalities, after a first episode of UTI, scarcely useful. VUR may be easily missed when RUS resulted normal and MCU is omitted. Negative MCU cannot exclude renal damage in presence of UTI. Renal defects at DMSA scan may be unrelated to a demonstrable VUR and could have a different pathogenesis.,16205610,2005
Pediatr Nephrol,Proinflammatory cytokines and procalcitonin in children with acute pyelonephritis.,This prospective study, performed in 76 children with a urinary tract infection (UTI), evaluates the diagnostic value of procalcitonin (PCT) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) in children with acute pyelonephritis documented by dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA). Renal parenchymal involvement was assessed by (99m )Tc-DMSA scintigraphy within 7 days of admission. The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis was confirmed only in patients with reversible lesions on scintigraphy. According to DMSA scan results, patients were divided into two groups, lower UTI or acute pyelonephritis. In acute pyelonephritis, serum PCT level was found to be significantly higher than it is in the lower UTI (p &lt;0.001). Also, significantly higher serum proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) levels were detected in those with acute pyelonephritis than those with lower UTI (p &lt;0.001). We conclude that both serum PCT and proinflammatory cytokine levels may be used as accurate markers for diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis.,16079986,2005
Pediatr Nephrol,Acute pyelonephritis and renal scarring in Kuwaiti children: a follow-up study using 99mTc DMSA renal scintigraphy.,The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of renal scarring in a group of Kuwaiti Arab children with their first documented acute pyelonephritis (APN). Eighty-two Kuwaiti Arab children (10 males and 72 females) who had abnormal (99m)Tc DMSA renal scan findings of acute pyelonephritis were prospectively studied with the same imaging modality 6 months after treatment to identify those who developed renal scarring. A micturition cystourethrogram (MCUG) was performed for all of the children 1 month after diagnosis. Children were divided into 3 age groups (&lt;2 years, 2-5 years and above 5 years). The follow-up DMSA renal scans 6 months after diagnosis revealed normalization of renal changes in 56% (46 patients), much improvement with residual renal abnormality in 6% (5 patients), and persistent parenchymal defects in 38% (31 patients). Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was found in 32% of children (26/82) and the majority were between grade I and III. Thirteen of those with VUR (50%) developed renal scars on follow-up. Fifty-three percent of the scarred kidneys (19/36) were drained by non-refluxing ureters. In this study, children older than 2 years had less VUR yet were more susceptible to APN and to the development of renal scars. Girls were more prone to developing APN and renal scarring than boys. This work shows that APN is a serious cause for renal scarring in our patients, particularly if associated with other risk factors such as recurrent infections and the female sex.,15973531,2005
Arch Dis Child,The presence of vesicoureteric reflux does not identify a population at risk for renal scarring following a first urinary tract infection.,BACKGROUND: Childhood urinary tract infection (UTI) with or without vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) may predispose to renal scarring. There is no clear consensus in the literature regarding imaging following UTI in infancy.AIMS: To define the role of cystography following a first UTI in children aged under 1 year, when urinary tract ultrasonography (US) is normal.METHODS: Retrospective data collection of 108 children (216 renal units) aged under 1 year at the time of a bacteriologically proven UTI. All had a normal US and underwent both catheter cystogram and DMSA test. Sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios positive and negative, and diagnostic odds ratio were calculated for VUR on cystography versus scarring on DMSA.RESULTS: VUR was shown in 25 (11.6%) renal units. Scarring on DMSA was seen in 8 (3.7 %) kidneys. Only 16% of kidneys with VUR had associated scarring; 50% of scarred kidneys were not associated with VUR. The likelihood ratio positive was 4.95 (95% CI 2.22 to 11.05) and the likelihood ratio negative was 0.56 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.11). The diagnostic odds ratio was 8.9, suggesting that cystography provided little additional information.CONCLUSION: Since only 16% of children with VUR had an abnormal kidney, the presence of VUR does not identify a susceptible population with an abnormal kidney on DMSA. In the context of a normal ultrasound examination, cystography contributes little to the management of children under the age of 1 year with a UTI. In this context, a normal DMSA study reinforces the redundancy of cystography.,15970618,2005
Arch Pediatr,[Usefulness of procalcitonin for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children].,BACKGROUND: Acute pyelonephritis can induce parenchymal scarring. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of procalcitonin (PCT) to predict renal involvement in febrile children with urinary tract infection (UTI).METHODS: In a prospective study serum PCT was measured and compared with others commonly used inflammatory markers in children admitted to the emergency unit with acute pyelonephritis. Renal parenchymal involvement was assessed by a (99 m)Tc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scar performed in the first 3 days after the admission.RESULTS: Among 42 enrolled patients, 19 (45%) had acute renal involvement (Group A) ; 23 (55%) (Group B) had normal DMSA scan (n = 16), or old scarring (n = 4) or various anomalies related to uropathy (n = 3). In group A, the mean PCT level was significantly higher than in the group B (5.4 ng/ml, vs 0.4 ng /ml, p &lt; 10(-5)). In these 2 groups, mean C reactive protein (CRP) levels were 99.1 mg/l and 44.6 mg/l respectively (p &lt; 0.001). For a level of serum PCT &gt; or = 0.5 ng/ml, the sensitivity and specificity to predict the renal involvement were 100% and 87% respectively; for a level&gt; or= 20 mg/l CRP had a sensitivity of 94% but a specificity of 30%.CONCLUSION: Serum PCT levels were significantly increased in febrile children with UTI when acute renal parenchymal involvement was present. PCT seems a better marker than CRP for the prediction of patients at risk of renal lesions.,15893462,2005
J Urol,Post-pyelonephritic renal scars are not associated with vesicoureteral reflux in children.,PURPOSE: Children with pyelonephritis are at risk for renal damage. We assess the value of clinical signs and urological abnormalities in predicting renal scars in children following pyelonephritis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 64 hospitalized children (29 females and 35 males, median age 2.9 years) underwent ultrasonography and technetium labeled dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy imaging within 1 week following the diagnosis of the first pyelonephritis. Voiding cystourethrography was performed 8 weeks after the diagnosis. Followup DMSA scintigraphy was performed in 58 patients after 2 years of followup.RESULTS: Urological abnormalities observed were vesicoureteral reflux (VUR, grade 2 or higher) in 11 patients (19%), nonrefluxing and nonobstructed megaureter in 2 (4%) and pyeloureteral obstruction in 1 (2%). The first DMSA scintigraphy showed parenchymal defects in 48% of patients. VUR did not increase the risk of renal defects. At 2 years after the infection 12 of the 58 patients (21%) had renal scars. Nine of these patients did not have VUR. However, 2 patients with high grade VUR and repeat infections demonstrated deterioration of kidney function during followup. The patients with renal scars were older than those without scars (3.1 vs 0.8 years, p = 0.0291) at the time of infection.CONCLUSIONS: Renal scars after first pyelonephritis are in most cases not associated with abnormalities of the urinary tract, but are caused by the infection itself. However, structural abnormalities may predispose to recurrent infections. Following pyelonephritis new renal scars may develop in all age groups in both sexes.,15758798,2005
Int Braz J Urol,Comparative study between intravenous urography and renal scintigraphy with DMSA for the diagnosis of renal scars in children with vesicoureteral reflux.,PURPOSE: To assess the value of intravenous urography (IVU) in detecting and grading the renal scar, comparing its results with those of scintigraphy with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 43 children investigated by DMSA and IVU, who had vesicoureteral reflux diagnosed and classified through voiding cystourethrography.RESULTS: Among the kidneys with reflux, there was agreement between the results of DMSA and IVU concerning the presence and the absence of scars in 82.4% of the cases. Based on the results obtained, IVU would have a sensitivity of 66.6%, specificity of 94.4%; accuracy of 82.5%; positive predictive value (PPV) of 90% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 79%, when compared with DMSA results. Our data also confirm the close relation between the reflux grade and the presence of renal scar, since 75% of the kidneys with grade IV and V reflux presented scars. In relation to the grading of nephropathy, in 78% of patients the classification of the scar by both methods was identical. The highest disagreement was verified in the group with segmental scar on DMSA, where 41.6% of the kidneys were classified as normal on IVU.CONCLUSION: The data obtained confirm that the scintigraphy with DMSA is essential in the investigation of patients with renal scar, and cannot be replaced by IVU, due to its low sensitivity and lower ability of satisfactory grading.,15748310,2005
J Urol,Correlation of renal ultrasonographic findings with inflammatory volume from dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans in children with acute pyelonephritis.,PURPOSE: We correlated abnormal findings on renal ultrasonography (US) and inflammatory volume (Volume) on technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid renal single photon emission computerized tomography (DMSA) in children with acute pyelonephritis (APN) with renal scars.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 31 males and 14 females (9 days to 9.8 years old) who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for APN and who underwent initial DMSA between January 1995 and July 2002 and followup DMSA at least 6 months later were enrolled in the study. APN was diagnosed by initial DMSA, and placement in the scar or scar-free group was determined by followup DMSA. Photopenic areas on initial DMSA were calculated as Volume, and were compared to US findings.RESULTS: Ultrasound demonstrated 35 abnormal kidneys (38.9%) among these children with APN. Significant differences in age, Volume (11.19 +/- 2.52 ml vs 3.02 +/- 0.75 ml, p &lt;0.005), C-reactive protein (CRP) and photopenic lesion on initial DMSA were found between children with abnormal and normal US. Of 65 children with initial APN foci 33 (50.8%) recovered, and the others had development of scars. The sensitivity of US for detecting APN (identified by DMSA scan) was 49.2%, and the specificity was 88% (OR 7.1, 95% CI 2.18 to 24.41). The sensitivity of US for predicting renal scarring was 59.4%, and the specificity was 60.6% (OR 2.3, 95% CI 0.82 to 7.65). Patients with abnormal US findings and high serum CRP (greater than 70 mg/l) had a large Volume (10.96 +/- 3.05 ml) and a 76.2% chance of being in the scar group.CONCLUSIONS: US findings are significantly correlated to Volume in APN. Along with a high level of CRP, US is helpful in predicting development of renal scarring.,15592072,2004
Pediatr Radiol,Can MRI replace DMSA in the detection of renal parenchymal defects in children with urinary tract infections?,BACKGROUND: Renal parenchymal defects may be a consequence of urinary tract infections (UTI) in childhood. MRI is a non-radiation imaging modality compared with DMSA scanning.OBJECTIVE: To compare DMSA with MRI for the detection of renal parenchymal defects in children presenting for radiological investigation after a first UTI.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Both DMSA and MRI were performed at the same appointment in 37 children (aged 4 months-13 years; mean 4.5 years) with a history of UTI. Both planar and SPECT DMSA were performed. MRI of the kidneys employed axial and coronal T1-, T2- and fat-saturated T1-weighted (T1-W) sequences. Some children had imaging after IV contrast medium.RESULTS: The coronal fat-saturated T1-W sequence was the best sequence and it detected all the findings on MRI. MRI had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 87% for the detection of a scarred kidney using DMSA as the gold standard. MRI diagnosed pyelonephritis in two children that had been interpreted as scarring on DMSA.CONCLUSIONS: Renal MRI using a single, coronal, fat-saturated T1-W sequence is a rapid, accurate and minimally invasive technique for the detection of renal scarring that does not employ ionizing radiation.,15490148,2004
Rev Med Chil,[Tc 99M DMSA scintigraphy in children with a first episode of acute pyelonephritis: correlation with laboratory tests, echography and the presence of vesico-ureteral reflux].,BACKGROUND: Tc99m DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) scintigraphy has a high sensitivity for the detection of cortical kidney damage.AIM: To evaluate the Tc99m DMSA renal scintigraphy in children with a first episode of acute pyelonephritis and its association with laboratory parameters, kidney ultrasound and vesicoureteral reflux.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 143 children (age range 8 days, 12 years, 66% female) hospitalized with the clinical diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (first episode) with a positive urine culture and a renal scintigraphy performed within seven days of diagnosis. DMSA was considered the gold standard for the detection of cortical lesions. Its results were related to the presence of fever, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (VHS), white blood count (WBC), ultrasound examination and vesicoureteral reflux.RESULTS: Seventy nine percent of the population had an abnormal DMSA scan. There were no differences between sex, age and laboratory parameters in children with normal or abnormal DMSA scans, except for CRP (p &lt;0.005). Ultrasound was coincident with the scan in 32% of patients. Eighteen percent had vesicoureteral reflux.CONCLUSIONS: There is a high proportion of abnormal DMSA scans in children with a first episode of acute pyelonephritis.,15379054,2004
Chang Gung Med J,The role of diuretic renography in the evaluation of obstructed hydronephrosis after pediatric pyeloplasty.,BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to clarify the value of renal drainage half-time in the evaluation of pediatric hydronephrosis after dismembered pyeloplasty.METHODS: We reviewed the records of 30 children who underwent dismembered pyeloplasty for unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction with no other associated urological abnormality. The follow-up duration was more than 5 years for all patients. Pre- and postoperative evaluation included technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) renal scan, technetium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) diuretic renography, and ultrasonographic examination. According to postoperative renal drainage half-time on diuretic renography, patients were divided into 2 groups: group A with normal renal drainage and group B with prolonged renal drainage for evaluation of their renal functional status.RESULTS: Postoperative diuretic renography revealed normal drainage (group A) in 54% of patients and prolonged drainage (group B) in 46%. The anteroposterior diameter (APD) of the renal pelvis of all patients showed improvement after pyeloplasty. There was no significant difference in improvement of the renal pelvic APD between the 2 groups. Furthermore, 92% of group A and 91% of group B maintained stable or had improved differential renal function (DRF) postoperatively.CONCLUSIONS: Drainage half-time is not a reliable parameter for diagnosing obstructed hydronephrosis after pediatric pyeloplasty. We suggest that the renal pelvic APD and DRF should be considered when postoperative obstructed hydronephrosis is diagnosed using the criterion of prolonged renal drainage half-time on diuretic renography.,15366810,2004
Nucl Med Commun,99mTc ethylene dicysteine scintigraphy for diagnosing cortical defects in acute pyelonephritis: a comparative study with 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid.,AIM: To evaluate the clinical usefulness of early cortical phase images in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and to compare the measurements of differential renal function obtained by both 99mTc ethylene dicysteine (99mTc-EC) and 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA).METHODS: Forty-three children who had undergone both 99mTc-EC and 99mTc-DMSA studies within 5 days of acute infection were studied. Cortical images of 99mTc-EC were obtained by the sum of the renogram frames achieved between the first 60-120 s of the renogram study. DMSA and EC images were visually interpreted using four points of semiquantitative ratings: 0, normal; 1, mild hypoactivity; 2, moderate hypoactivity with partial loss of margins; 3, marked hypoactivity with loss of cortical margins. Values for the differential renal function were obtained for both studies.RESULTS: DMSA detected a total of 109 lesions in 36 patients and EC detected 90 lesions with a sensitivity of 82.5%. 99mTc-EC successfully detected moderate-to-severe cortical lesions but was less effective with mild lesions (sensitivity 60%). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated good agreement among the results for differential renal function (95% CI -0.26 to 0.96).CONCLUSION: 99mTc-EC early phase images detected most of the cortical lesions. Its sensitivity depends on the severity of the lesions. EC provided reliable information in the estimation of differential renal function.,15319604,2004
Pediatrics,Procalcitonin: a marker of severity of acute pyelonephritis among children.,OBJECTIVE: Febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common problem among children. The diagnosis and management of acute pyelonephritis is a challenge, particularly during infancy. The distinction between acute pyelonephritis and UTI without renal involvement is very important, because renal infection may cause parenchymal scarring and thus requires more aggressive investigation and follow-up monitoring. However, this distinction is not easy among children, because common clinical findings and laboratory parameters are nonspecific, especially among young children. In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from febrile UTI without renal lesions in a group of 100 children, we measured serum levels of procalcitonin (PCT), a new marker of infection. The objective of the study was to determine the accuracy of PCT measurements, compared with C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements, in diagnosing acute renal involvement during febrile UTI and in predicting subsequent scars, as assessed with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.DESIGN: Serum CRP levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, leukocyte counts, and PCT levels were measured for 100 children, 1 month to 13 years of age, admitted for suspected febrile UTI (first episode). Renal parenchymal involvement was evaluated with DMSA scintigraphy within 5 days after admission. The DMSA study was repeated 6 months later if the initial results were abnormal.RESULTS: The mean PCT level was significantly higher in acute pyelonephritis than in UTI without renal lesions (4.48 +/- 5.84 ng/mL vs 0.44 +/- 0.30 ng/mL). In these 2 groups, the mean CRP levels were 106 +/- 68.8 mg/L and 36.4 +/- 26 mg/L, mean erythrocyte sedimentation rates were 79.1 +/- 33 mm/hour and 58.5 +/- 33 mm/hour, and leukocyte counts were 18 492 +/- 6839 cells/mm3 and 16 741 +/- 5302 cells/mm3, respectively. For the prediction of acute pyelonephritis, the sensitivity and specificity of PCT measurements were 83.3% and 93.6%, respectively; CRP measurements had a sensitivity of 94.4% but a specificity of only 31.9%. Positive and negative predictive values for prediction of renal involvement with PCT measurements were 93.7% and 83% and those with CRP measurements were 61.4% and 83.3%, respectively. When inflammatory markers were correlated with the severity of the renal lesions, as assessed with DMSA scintigraphy, a highly significant correlation with both PCT and CRP levels was found. However, when the 2 parameters were correlated with renal scarring in follow-up scans, a significant positive association was found only for PCT levels.CONCLUSIONS: Serum PCT levels may be a sensitive and specific measure for early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and determination of the severity of renal parenchymal involvement. Therefore, this measurement could be useful for the treatment of children with febrile UTIs, allowing prediction of patients at risk of permanent parenchymal renal lesions.,15286264,2004
Pediatr Nephrol,Power Doppler ultrasonography in the diagnosis of acute childhood pyelonephritis.,In the absence of specific symptomatology in children, the early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a challenge, particularly during infancy. In an attempt to differentiate APN from lower urinary tract infection (UTI), we evaluated the ability of power Doppler ultrasonography (PDU) to predict renal parenchymal involvement, as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m )Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy. The study comprised 62 patients, 46 girls and 16 boys, aged 2 weeks to 5 years, admitted to the pediatric department with febrile UTI. All children were examined by PDU and DMSA scintigraphy within the first 3 days of admission. In the group of 31 patients with one or more DMSA scan abnormalities, the PDU showed a matching perfusion defect in 27 (87%). Of 26 children with normal DMSA scintigraphy, the PDU evaluation was also normal in 24. The sensitivity and specificity of PDU for the detection of affected kidneys were 87% and 92.3%, and the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 93.1% and 85.7%, respectively. These data indicate the PDU has a high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating APN from lower UTI and may be a useful and practical tool for the diagnosis of APN in infants and children.,15241674,2004
J Urol,Magnetic resonance urography: a new gold standard for the evaluation of solitary kidneys and renal buds?,PURPOSE: We evaluated the diagnostic potential of magnetic resonance urography (MRU) in pediatric patients with a solitary kidney and/or dysplastic orthotopic or ectopic renal buds. We present our evolving experience with this imaging procedure.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 patients with a mean age of 43.8 months with a known or suspected solitary kidney with or without clinical symptoms underwent ultrasound of the urinary tract as well as voiding cystourethrogram, renal static dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy and MRU. The results of these diagnostic imaging studies were then compared with each other and set against the results of the final diagnosis established at surgery and by histology, if available.RESULTS: Dysplastic orthotopic or dystopic renal buds suspected on ultrasound in 11 of the 30 patients were confirmed in all 11 by MRU. While accompanying ectopic ureteral insertions were shown in only 3 patients by ultrasound, they were visualized in all 4 by MRU. The other 7 patients with dysplastic renal buds had orthotopic ureteral orifices. DMSA scintigraphy failed to detect 10 renal buds.CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic value of MRU appears to be superior to that of other imaging tests, even to that of DMSA scintigraphy, which with voiding cystourethrography is currently considered the gold standard for evaluating sonographically suspected solitary kidneys with contralateral orthotopic or ectopic renal buds and ectopic ureteral insertion.,15017255,2004
Pediatr Nephrol,Resistive index in febrile urinary tract infections: predictive value of renal outcome.,In the absence of specific symptomatology in children, the early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is a challenge, particularly during infancy. In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary tract infection (UTI), we measured intrarenal resistive index (RI). We evaluated its ability to predict renal involvement as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. In total 157 patients admitted to the pediatric department of the Sişli Etfal Hospital with clinical signs of febrile UTI were included in the study. The children were divided into groups according to their age at the time of ultrasonography (US). RI was measured from the renal arteries with Doppler US in the first 72 h in all 157 children. Renal involvement was assessed by (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy in the first 7 days after admission. The examination was repeated at least 6 months later if the first result was abnormal. All available patients with an abnormal scintigraphy underwent voiding cystourethrography 4-6 weeks after the acute infection. All patients with vesicoureteral reflux and scarred kidneys were excluded from the study. DMSA scintigraphy demonstrated abnormal changes in 114 of 157 children and was normal in the remaining 43 children. Of these 114 children, 104 underwent repeat scintigraphy, of whom 77 showed partially or totally reversible lesion(s). Of these 77 children, 17 children (22%) with vesicoureteral reflux were excluded. Thus, we compared the 43 children with lower UTI with the 60 children with definite acute pyelonephritis at admission. Kidneys with changes of acute pyelonephritis had a mean RI of 0.744+/-0.06 in infants, 0.745+/-0.03 in preschool children, and 0.733+/-0.09 in patients of school age with upper UTI. However, the mean RI was 0.703+/-0.06 in infants, 0.696+/-0.1 in preschool children, and 0.671+/-0.09 in school-aged patients with lower UTI. The mean RI values were significantly higher in patients with upper UTI ( P&lt;0.001). There was a highly significant correlation between RI values and the severity of the renal lesion as ranked by DMSA scintigraphy ( P&lt;0.001). When the cut-off RI value was 0.715, there was an 80% sensitivity and a 89% specificity for diagnosing upper UTI. Refluxing kidneys and scarred kidneys also had higher RI values. In conclusion, RI values were increased significantly in children with febrile UTI when renal parenchymal involvement (assessed by DMSA scintigraphy) was present. Our results also support the view that the children with high RI values are at a high risk of reflux, scarring, or both, which was frequently observed in febrile UTI. This might allow identification of patients at risk for severe renal lesions that require more aggressive therapy, investigation, and follow-up than those with lower UTI.,14685837,2003
J Pediatr (Rio J),[Renal scintigraphy using technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid in the diagnosis of pyelonephritis in children: study of 17 cases],OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence of abnormal results in DMSA renal scintigraphy indicates pyelonephritis. METHODS: We performed the washout test in 17 children with urinary tract infection, as a criterion standard, to locate the infection site. All the children underwent DMSA renal scintigraphy in the acute phase of the disease. The results were analyzed by the chi-square test or Fisher test. RESULTS: DMSA renal scintigraphy revealed changes in all five cases of pyelonephritis, suggesting acute kidney involvement. On the other hand, only one child with cystitis (total = 12 cases) had abnormal results in renal scintigraphy. Sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 92%, respectively. CONCLUSION: DMSA renal scintigraphy is a sensitive method for the diagnosis of pyelonephritis in children.,14647602,2003
BJU Int,Split renal function does not change after successful treatment in children with primary vesico-ureteric reflux.,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the renal growth pattern in patients with primary vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) using long-term measurements of split renal function with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 712 children aged &lt; 16 years (466 boys and 246 girls) with primary VUR were referred to our hospital from July 1991 to December 2000. VUR was diagnosed by voiding cysto-urethrography. The patients were treated either surgically (group 1) or conservatively (group 2) and followed with serial 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy for up to 10 years. There were 942 examinations in 367 of 712 patients who had repeat scintigraphy. Patients with secondary VUR, VUR to a solitary or fused kidney, or upper urinary tract obstruction, were excluded. Five of 298 patients (1.7%) who had ureteric reimplantation had a febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) soon after surgery but none recurred (recurrence is an indication for surgery in children with VUR); there was no febrile UTI in the 69 patients in group 2. Planar scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA was used to assess the absolute uptake (AU) of each kidney, measured as a percentage of the injected dose, and the relative uptake (RU = AU of each kidney/AU of both kidneys) calculated. The initial examination was at least 4 weeks after any febrile UTI in most patients. Serial studies were conducted 1 year after surgery and then biannually in group 1. In group 2 the DMSA scan was repeated every 2-3 years. The change in split renal function was compared with the RU of the right kidney.RESULTS: The RU of the right kidney at the initial scan correlated closely with those on repeated scans in both groups. The correlation coefficients were 0.99 in group 1 and 0.94-0.97 in group 2 at every study. The change of RU remained within 0.05 in all patients after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Under strict control of UTI, split renal function in children with primary VUR does not change. There may be no possibility of accelerated or compensatory growth of the kidney with reflux nephropathy, but no concern about deterioration and atrophy either.,14632865,2003
J Nucl Med,123I-hippuran renal scintigraphy with evaluation of single-kidney clearance for predicting renal scarring after acute urinary tract infection: comparison with (99m)Tc-DMSA scanning.,The value of (123)I-hippuran (OIH) renal sequential scintigraphy (RSS) in predicting the evolution of defects detected by (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning during a first episode of acute pyelonephritis (APN) was assessed.</AbstractText>: The value of (123)I-hippuran (OIH) renal sequential scintigraphy (RSS) in predicting the evolution of defects detected by (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning during a first episode of acute pyelonephritis (APN) was assessed.METHODS: Fifty-eight children with APN underwent (99m)Tc-DMSA planar scanning and (123)I-OIH RSS during acute infection and at least 5 mo later. Renal lesions found by (99m)Tc-DMSA scanning were classified according to the following (99m)Tc-DMSA grading system: 0 = normal, 1 = 1 lesion, 2 = 2 lesions, and 3 = diffuse damage with renal parenchymal subversion. Renal scarring was diagnosed whenever a renal cortical defect detected at the first (99m)Tc-DMSA examination persisted on the follow-up (99m)Tc-DMSA examination. Single-kidney clearance rate (Cl) was evaluated by a method that was previously validated at our institution and is based on time-activity curves measured on the heart and kidney areas by the region-of-interest technique.RESULTS: (99m)Tc-DMSA scanning showed renal damage in 76 kidneys and had negative findings for the remaining 40 kidneys (2 patients had bilaterally negative findings). (99m)Tc-DMSA scanning determined 40 kidneys to be grade 0, 49 to be grade 1, 21 to be grade 2, and 6 to be grade 3. For (99m)Tc-DMSA grades of 0-3, the corresponding Cl mean values (in mL/min/1.73 m(2) of body surface area [BSA]) were 292 +/- 33, 237 +/- 39, 210 +/- 54, and 140 +/- 53, respectively. The Spearman regression coefficient (R) demonstrated a significant correlation between (99m)Tc-DMSA grade and Cl (R = 0.69, P &lt; 0.0001). Thirty-six of the lesions detected by staging (99m)Tc-DMSA were shown to have recovered on follow-up renal scans, whereas 40 developed scars. A significant difference in Cl was found between the 2 groups (P &lt; 0.0002). The Cl cutoff value was determined by univariate discriminant analysis; a Cl value of 232 mL/min/1.73 m(2) of BSA discriminated best between scarred and nonscarred kidneys, with a specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy of 95%, 95%, 90%, 97%, and 95%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Cl evaluation, in the course of acute urinary tract infection, is highly valuable in predicting the fibrotic evolution of renal damage detected on acute (99m)Tc-DMSA scanning. Also, our data show close agreement between Cl and the grade determined by staging (99m)Tc-DMSA.,14602856,2003
Acta Med Croatica,[The value of Tc99m-DMSA renal scintigraphy in evaluation of severity of parenchymal lesions in children with acute urinary tract infection].,INTRODUCTION: Most authors would agree that renal parenchymal defects (scars, hypoplasia, dysplasia) in children are a major risk factor for chronic renal failure, and for development of systemic hypertension in later years. The pathophysiologic changes in acute pyelonephritis include tubulointerstitial inflammation/pus with impairment of the renal microcirculation due to compression of the glomeruli, small peritubular capillaries and vasa recta by interstitial edema. The resulting ischemia has been postulated as one of the mechanisms for the decreased accumulation of DMSA in the areas of pyelonephritis. DMSA scanning has a sensitivity of up to 99%, and specificity of up to 91% for the detection of acute pyelonephritis.AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to investigate the value of Tc99m-DMSA scan in children with acute urinary tract infection, to estimate the degree of parenchymal changes, and to assess the relationship with vesicoureteral reflux.PATIENTS: We reviewed 116 infants aged 0-15 years, 100 (86.2%) female and 16 (13.8%) male, who were hospitalized for urinary tract infection during a 5-year period (1996-2000). The mean age at diagnosis was 3.7 years.RESULTS: Escherichia colli was isolated in 52 (44.8%) urine cultures. All patients underwent ultrasonography, which was normal in 57 (49.1%) infants. Tc99m-DMSA was performed after two weeks of therapy. The renal parenchymal pathology was defined as a focal or multifocal defect of low degree in 33 (28.4%), and of high degree in 35 (30%) children. Multifocal defects were mostly found in patients aged &lt; 3 years, and focal lesions in those aged &gt; 3 years. Renal scars were detected in 41 (35.3%) infants with first urinary tract infection.CONCLUSION: We recommend that ultrasound, DMSA and radionuclide cystouretherogram be routinely performed in case of first urinary tract infection in infants aged &lt; 1 year, and voiding cystourethrogram with US and DMSA in those aged &gt; 1 year.,12876855,2003
Nucl Med Commun,The 99mTc-DMSA renal scan and 99mTc-DTPA diuretic renogram in children and adolescents with incidental diagnosis of horseshoe kidney.,A prospective study was conducted to determine the possibility of obstructive hydronephrosis in horseshoe kidney found incidentally in school children and adolescents by using a radionuclide diuretic renogram. In a 2-year period, 22 school children and adolescents with horseshoe kidney were found in a mass renal sonography survey. They each underwent a 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid renal cortical scan to confirm the horseshoe kidney. Each diuretic renogram was performed with the patient in the supine position to rule out obstructive hydronephrosis. The patients were advised to empty their bladders before the intravenous injection of furosemide (1 mg x kg(-1)). The half-time for the clearance of radioactivity from the renal pelvis were calculated. Of the 22 patients, asymmetrical renal cortical function between the two kidneys was found in 14 (63.6%). Eleven kidneys (11/44, 25%) showed stasis of radioactive urine in the renal pelvic region prior to injection of furosemide. There was no incidence of bilateral hydronephrosis in these 22 patients. Only one kidney (1/44, 2.3%) showed obstructive hydronephrosis and five showed clearance of radioactive urine stasis from the renal pelvis immediately after standing up for voiding. There is a low percentage of obstructive hydronephrosis in these cases of horseshoe kidney found incidentally in children and adolescents. A follow-up cohort study on these patients would be valuable for monitoring the development of complications.,12717069,2003
Rays,The role of nuclear medicine in evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux and/or reflux nephropathy.,Early identification of different categories of the risk of scarring in children with first (or follow up) urinary tract infection and/or early detection and treatment of vesicoureteral reflux are important to prevent kidney impairment. The demonstration and grading of reflux is crucial in examination and follow up of any child with urinary tract infection. Nephro-urologic radionuclide studies are able to detect vesicoureteral reflux and reflux nephropathy, such as radionuclide cystography--RNC--(both direct radionuclide voiding cystography--DRVC--and indirect radionuclide cystography-IRC), renal DMSA scintigraphy, MAG3 renal diuresis scintigraphy and DTPA renal diuresis scintigraphy. They allow to assess renal parenchyma integrity, to detect pyelonephritic scars, to evaluate the different aspects of urinary tract function and to measure absolute and relative function after intravenous injection of radiopharmaceuticals. The procedure, image acquisition and processing and the diagnostic relevance of all aforesaid nephro-urologic radionuclide studies are illustrated.,12696269,2003
Tunis Med,[Contribution of clinical, biological and radiological parameters in the diagnosis of urinary infection localization].,Urinary infection was a problem in pediatrics. Currently the diagnosis is easy but it is hard to diagnosis the localisation of the infection. We have to go fast and precisely to treat correctly this infection and diminich the possibility of developing renal scars. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy is a reference exam for detection acute renal lesions. We have realised a prospective study in 29 children presenting urinary tract infection. In whom a DMSA scintigraphy is realised between the one day and 30 days after the infection. We study the sensibility ans the specificity of clinical, biological and radiological parameter for the diagnosis of localisation of the infection. The better parameter of sensibility of upper urinary tract infection is of fever, and the better parameter of specificity is the association of fever, echo Doppler renal and VS.,12632757,2003
Clin Nucl Med,Radionuclide imaging of rare congenital renal fusion anomalies.,Demonstration of a congenital renal anomaly plays an important role in the treatment of patients with renal infection. These patients are prone to infections because of coexisting urinary tract anomalies such as duplicated ureter, ureter opening anomalies, and urinary stasis. Assessment of renal parenchymal damage resulting from acute or chronic renal infection is the primary indication for radionuclide imaging with Tc-99m DMSA. In addition, this technique allows congenital anomalies to be identified. The authors review congenital renal fusion anomalies identified in children through Tc-99m DMSA imaging. They conclude that Tc-99m DMSA imaging can reveal important diagnostic information about various congenital anomalies, including fusion anomalies.,12592127,2003
Clin Nucl Med,Power Doppler sonography versus Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy for diagnosing acute pyelonephritis in children: are these two methods comparable?,PURPOSE This study assessed the role of renal power Doppler ultrasonography (PDU) to identify acute pyelonephritis (APN) and to determine whether PDU can replace Tc-99m DMSA renal scintigraphy in the diagnosis of APN in children. METHODS A prospective study was conducted in 40 infants and young children (78 kidneys were evaluated) with a mean age of 25.9 months (range, 1 to 68 months) who were hospitalized with a first episode of high fever and bacteruria, possibly APN. All children were examined by PDU and Tc-99m DMSA within the first 3 days after admission. Patients with congenital abnormalities, hydronephrosis, and urinary reflux were excluded. RESULTS Twenty-seven of the 78 kidneys appeared abnormal on Tc-99m DMSA, and 20 of them were abnormal on PDU. Fifty-one of 78 kidneys were normal on Tc-99m DMSA, and 3 of 51 appeared diseased on PDU. The accuracy of PDU was 87%, sensitivity was 74%, and specificity was 94%. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were both 87%. When considering the numbers of lesions in 27 kidneys with positive Tc-99m DMSA studies (38 lesions), PDU did not disclose 16 lesions (false-negative results). Thus, the sensitivity of PDU for diagnosing lesions of APN decreased to 58%. CONCLUSIONS A positive PDU finding should obviate the use of Tc-99m DMSA in patients thought to have possible APN. However, because of a large number of false-negative results (26%) and underestimation of the number of pyelonephritic lesions (low sensitivity of 58%), PDU cannot replace Tc-99m DMSA in the diagnosis of APN in children.,12592126,2003
Ann Acad Med Stetin,[Renal scintigraphy using technetium Tc 99m-ethylenedicysteine or SPECT as a method for examining kidneys in children diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux].,Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) can lead to parenchymal lesions of the kidneys. Renal scarring is an important cause of chronic renal failure and hypertension in children. Effective prevention necessitates an early diagnosis of urinary tract pathology. The aim of this work was to examine renal morphology and function in VUR using radioisotope techniques and to compare the sensitivity of the planar technique and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detection of renal scarring. The following examinations were performed in 45 children with VUR: ultrasonography, renoscintigraphy with technetium-99m-etylenedicysteine (EC-Tc-99m) or technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA-Tc-99m) in planar and SPECT modes. The stage of VUR correlated with cortical lesions as reflected by effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and scarring as shown by static scintigraphy. The use of SPECT increased diagnostic sensitivity in the case of small and isolated scars. Thus, SPECT would be recommended in children at risk of renal scarring. The correlation between ERPF and DMSA scintigraphy findings supports the use of EC-Tc-99m renoscintigraphy to monitor the process of renal scarring.,12514903,2003

Pediatr Med Chir,[Influence of the early renal status on natural history of vesico-ureteral reflux diagnosed in the first six month of life].,INTRODUCTION: Ultrasonographic and radionuclide imaging of kidney in presence of major vesicoureteric reflux, diagnosed in the first months of life, reflects a congenital anomaly of development of ureteric bud and metanephric blastema, more than a parenchymal damage secondary to superimposed infections. These lesions are mainly observed in male infants affected by reflux and referred on the basis of a prenatal diagnosis. The impact of therapy on these kidneys is still debated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 273 pediatric patients with VUR observed between 1991 and 2000, 48 cases have been selected where a reflux grade III or greater had been diagnosed within the first six months of life. Cause of admission was prenatal diagnosis in 29 cases and recurrent infection in 19. Reflux was bilateral in 30 patients. Cases of VUR associated to other urological or neurological anomalies were excluded. A complete ultrasonographic, cystographic and radionuclide study was performed in all patients included in the present study within the fourth month of life. Mean Follow up lasted 17 months. Renal damage was graded by ultrasonography and DMSA renal scan on the basis or of a reduction in total kidney size and a poor radionuclide uptake either of an altered renal profile associated to focal defects of uptake.RESULTS: Resolution of reflux within the mean follow up period, was observed in 16 patients, even with high grade VUR, whenever major renal lesions were absent or focal. When severe renal damage was initially demonstrated the expectancy of reduction or resolution of VUR was significantly reduced and surgical option was considered.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with major VUR diagnosed in the first months of life, early renal status affects prognosis more than the severity of reflux.,12197085,2002
Semin Dial,Nuclear medicine studies in the dialysis patient.,Nuclear medicine (scintigraphy) studies that are performed in patients being prepared for regular dialysis treatment include the measurement of renal clearance and dynamic studies of renal perfusion and function. Static scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA may be used in the evaluation of children at risk of renal damage and further functional deterioration. In patients on peritoneal dialysis, nuclear medicine procedures enable the diagnosis of structural complications such as intra-abdominal herniations and leaks. Diagnosis of infections of the vascular access sites in patients on hemodialysis and of the catheter tunnel in patients on peritoneal dialysis can be made with high diagnostic accuracy using radiolabeled, autologous leukocytes. Scintigraphy is valuable in delineating the extent of deposits of amyloid and parenchymal microcalcifications, and may be helpful in the functional evaluation of organs and tissues involved in the pathophysiology of renal impairment and dialysis. If radioiodine therapy with 131I is performed in patients on hemodialysis with benign or malignant thyroid disease, then pretherapeutic dosimetry is necessary to avoid over- and undertreatment. Radioiodine therapy in the dialysis patient leads to only insignificant contamination of dialysis equipment and marginal exposure to the medical staff.,12191027,2002
J Med Assoc Thai,Relationship between vesicoureteral reflux and renal cortical scar development in Thai children: the significance of renal cortical scintigraphy and direct radionuclide cystography.,Relationship of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), urinary tract infection (UTI) and subsequent renal scarring nowadays is still in question. This study aimed to determine 1) the incidence of cortical scarring in Thai children presenting with upper urinary tract infection, 2) the association between VUR with acute pyelonephritis and subsequent renal scarring, 3) the use of DMSA and direct radionuclide cystography (DRNC) scintigraphy in children with UTI. Sixty newly diagnosed UTI children underwent DRNC and Tc-99m DMSA renal cortical scintigraphy at the time of first UTI diagnosis and 6 months later. There were no significant differences of age, sex, type of antiobiotics and pathogens (E. coli vs non-E. coli) between those who did and did not develop scars (p&gt;0.05). 58/98 of 1st DMSA abnormal kidneys (59.18%) developed scars. 60.20 per cent of 98 positive 1st DMSA had VUR while 80.33 per cent of 61 with VUR had positive 1st DMSA. 59.02 per cent of these 61 kidneys developed scars. Scar occurrence were 18.7 times in high grade VUR compared to low grades. In conclusion, there was a high incidence of acute pyelonephritis in the presence of VUR but acute pyelonephritis does not necessarily need VUR for its development. High grade reflux with upper UTI, is a strong indicator for renal scarring. Children presenting with UTI, irrespective of age, sex, or pathogen, should have both DMSA and DRNC scintigraphy performed to identify upper UTI and high risk patients who will develop subsequent renal scarring.,12188413,2002
Pediatr Nephrol,Acute renal damage in infants after first urinary tract infection.,Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common causes of unexplained fever in neonates. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of urinary tract anomalies and acute renal damage in neonates who presented with first urinary tract infection in the first 8 weeks of life. We reviewed the records of 95 infants, who were hospitalised with UTI during a 6-year period (1994-1999). Patients with antenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis and incomplete radiological investigations were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 57 patients, 42 were boys and 15 girls. The mean age at diagnosis was 32 days (range 5-60 days). All patients underwent renal ultrasonography (US), voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Urinary tract abnormalities were detected in 20 (35%) patients. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was found in 19 (33%) neonates, 7 girls and 12 boys. Acute cortical defects on DMSA scan were present in 19 kidneys of patients with VUR and in 25 of those without reflux. Only one-third of neonates after first symptomatic UTI had VUR. We recommend that US, VCUG, and DMSA scan should be routinely performed after the first UTI in infants younger than 8 weeks.,12172762,2002
Pediatr Nephrol,Procalcitonin as a marker of acute pyelonephritis in infants and children.,In the absence of specific symptomatology in children, the early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is a challenge, particularly during infancy. In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary tract infection (UTI), we measured serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels and compared these with other commonly used inflammatory markers. We evaluated the ability of serum PCT levels to predict renal involvement, as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocyte counts, and PCT levels were measured in 64 children admitted for suspected UTI. Renal parenchymal involvement was assessed by (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy in the first 7 days after admission. In acute pyelonephritis, the median PCT level was significantly higher than in the lower UTI group (3.41, range 0.36-12.4 microg/l vs. 0.13, range 0.02-2.15 microg/l, P&lt;0.0001). In these two groups, respectively, median CRP levels were 120 (range 62-249 mg/l) and 74.5 (range 14.5-235 mg/l, P=0.012) and leukocyte counts were 15,910/mm(3) (range 10,200-26,900) and 14,600/mm(3) (range 8,190-26,470, P=0.34). For the prediction of acute pyelonephritis, the sensitivity and specificity of PCT were 94.1% and 89.7%, respectively; CRP had a sensitivity of 100%, but a specificity of 18.5%. We conclude that serum PCT may be an accurate marker for early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis.,12107804,2002
Pol Merkur Lekarski,[Influence of selected factors on the development of renal scars in children with vesico-ureteric complex].,Although relationship between vesico-ureteric reflux, urinary tract infection and renal scarring is known, pathogenesis of the renal scarring is still unclear. Vesico-ureteric reflux and urinary tract infection remain in very close relationship, they may also occur separately. The factor promoting renal injury is also young age of a child. The aim of this paper was to analyse the influence of the selected factors, namely: degree of the vesico-ureteric reflux; child's age at reflux diagnosis time as well as the frequency of recurrences of urinary tract infections exerted on reflux nephropathy. In 45 children with diagnosed vesicoureteric reflux the intensity of renal scarring was estimated using planar scintigraphy with DMSA-Tc-99m and a questionnaire was prepared. The questionnaire included information as follows: age at which the diagnosis was established, degree of reflux at the time of diagnosis, treatment applied, frequency of urinary tract infections before and after having taking medical care of children. It was revealed that the degree of scarring correlated with degree of vesico-ureteric reflux of particular kidney. In the investigated group no correlations were found between intensity of renal scarring and both the age of establishing diagnosis and frequency of urinary tract infections before starting the treatment. Taking the obtained results into consideration it seems, that the degree of vesico-ureteric reflux estimated prior to treatment determines degree of renal injuries though, undoubtedly all factors being studied affect renal scarring.,12089886,2002
Pediatr Surg Int,The role of DMSA scans in evaluation of the correlation between urinary tract infection, vesicoureteric reflux, and renal scarring.,The correlation between urinary tract infection (UTI), vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and renal scarring was studied in 89 patients (177 renal units; 1 solitary kidney) during the period 1997-2000. There were 63 males and 26 females; ages ranged from neonates to 14 years. UTI was diagnosed on the basis of a positive urine culture, VUR was diagnosed and graded by micturating cystourethrogram (MCU), and renal scarring was assessed by technetium 99 m Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Ultrasonography (US) was done to evaluate renal tract dilatation and other structural abnormalities. A follow up DMSA scan was performed approximately 6 months after the initial scan. VUR was present in 106 of the 171 renal units in which it was studied and absent in 65 units. The majority of the VUR was grade V. Renal scars were seen in 90 of 177 renal units at presentation and in 72 of the 163 renal units studied at follow-up. Some information was lacking in 31 patients; hence, the correlation between UTI, VUR, and renal scarring was done in 58 patients. The majority of the suspected scars at presentation were not seen at follow-up, but most of the established scars persisted. Only 2 renal units showed scars for the first time on follow-up. On US, approximately 50% of normal kidneys showed either suspicious or established scars on DMSA scan, and patients with bilateral abnormality on US showed renal scars. Renal scars were seen in 15 of 23 children without VUR, 17 of 18 with unilateral VUR, and 16 of 17 with bilateral VUR. Thus, there is a cause-and-effect relationship between UTI and renal scarring that is made worse by VUR. DMSA scans have been shown to be the most reliable method of assessing renal scarring, and an abnormal US scan showing upper-tract dilatation or a structural abnormality may have a predictive value in the detection of renal scarring.,11956778,2002
Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,[Acute pyelonephritis in children with minimal or normal urine findings].,BACKGROUND: Over the past years we have seen several children with serious bacterial infections in whom the focus of the infection was found in the kidneys despite of normal or minimal urine findings.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We review the cases of all children hospitalised at our paediatric department from 1995-2000 with normal or minimal urine findings, and in whom acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed by means of computerized tomographic imaging of the kidneys.RESULTS: All 10 children (aged 9 months to 9 years) had focal areas of decreased enhancement in the kidney parenchyma. All received intravenous antibiotic treatment. Vesicouretheral reflux was detected in four patients and required surgical intervention in one. One patient had considerable renal scarring and decreased renal function on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy.INTERPRETATION: In children with suspected serious bacterial infection, it is important to have the possibility of renal infection in mind in spite of normal urine findings. The importance of establishing the right diagnosis lies in the fact that patients with pyelonephritis need further investigation and follow-up.,11876137,2002
Clin Nucl Med,Ectopic ureteroceles in infants with prenatal hydronephrosis: use of renal cortical scintigraphy.,PURPOSE: This study assesses the contribution of renal cortical scintigraphy in the diagnostic evaluation of infants with ectopic ureteroceles.METHODS: The records of 20 infants (age range, 3 weeks to 4 months) who were referred for renal cortical scintigraphy after an ectopic ureterocele associated with a duplex kidney was found during follow-up of prenatal hydronephrosis were reviewed retrospectively. All infants underwent voiding cystourethrography, ultrasonography, and Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy.RESULTS: All upper moieties showed absent or depressed Tc-99m DMSA uptake. Upper moiety functional impairment was associated with structural abnormalities shown by ultrasonography. The degree of functional impairment was reflective of ultrasonographically defined cortical thickness relative to pelvic diameter, but this relation varied. Eight of 20 (40%) lower moieties had diffusely depressed relative Tc-99m DMSA uptake. Focal defects were also present in three of these eight (38%) lower moieties. Lower moiety functional impairment was associated with higher degrees of pelvic dilatation and with vesicoureteral reflux. Ultrasonography revealed diffuse parenchymal thinning in four of the eight (50%) lower moieties with depressed uptake. Ultrasonography did not define focal parenchymal loss in any lower moiety.CONCLUSIONS: The degree to which function is impaired in the upper moieties of duplex kidneys with ureters terminating in ectopic ureteroceles is not highly predictable by ultrasonography. Lower moiety functional impairment and cortical defects are frequently present in these kidneys and often occur without ultrasonographic evidence of parenchymal damage. Use of renal cortical scintigraphy in the diagnostic evaluation of infants with ectopic ureteroceles is supported.,11852302,2002
J Nucl Med,Color and power Doppler sonography versus DMSA scintigraphy in acute pyelonephritis and in prediction of renal scarring.,Capabilities of color and power Doppler sonography (DS) were prospectively evaluated for diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and for prediction of scarring by comparison with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA).</AbstractText>: Capabilities of color and power Doppler sonography (DS) were prospectively evaluated for diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and for prediction of scarring by comparison with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA).METHODS: Fifty-seven children (mean age, 5 +/- 3 y) with acute pyelonephritis were investigated by biologic testing, DS (DS 1), and DMSA (DMSA 1). Patients who were &lt;6 mo old or had high-grade reflux or obstruction were excluded. Forty-five children had a clinical follow-up examination, biologic testing, DS (DS 2), and DMSA (DMSA 2) at a mean of 7 +/- 2 mo after acute infection. Sonography (gray-scale and DS) was performed by 1 experienced radiologist who was unaware of patient data. DMSA studies were interpreted by 2 physicians who were unaware of patient data.RESULTS: Temperature, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein value were significantly higher in patients with abnormal DMSA 1 findings than in those with abnormal DS 1 findings (P &lt; 0.05). When compared with DMSA 1, DS 1 had a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 81%, respectively. At follow-up, all clinical and biologic data had normalized. Scarring after infection occurred in 51% of children. When compared with DMSA 2, DS 1 had positive and negative predictive values of 57% and 75%, respectively, and DMSA 1 had respective values of 62% and 100%. Reflux was not considered a good predictor of scarring.CONCLUSION: DS and DMSA results were concordant in 81% of kidneys with acute pyelonephritis. The predictive value of DS for renal scarring was not considered sufficiently high for DS to be used in routine practice.,11801699,2002
Pediatr Nephrol,Age-related radiological imaging in children with acute pyelonephritis.,Accurate diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) using clinical and laboratory parameters is often difficult in children. The aims of this retrospective study were twofold. Firstly, to correlate the clinical and laboratory manifestations of APN with the results of the dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in different age groups. Secondly, to compare the DMSA renal scan, renal ultrasonography (RUS), and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in patients with clinical APN. The DMSA renal scan was utilized as the gold standard for renal involvement. We determined the sensitivity of these tests in febrile urinary tract infections (UTI) in three age groups: group I less than 2 years; group II 2-8 years; group III older than 8 years. During the period January 1992 through December 1998, 222 children presented with a febrile UTI. All patients had a DMSA renal scan, 208 had contrast VCUG, and 163 had RUS. The clinical and laboratory manifestation of pyelonephritis correlated better with a positive DMSA renal scan in the older children than in the younger children; 85% of the DMSA renal scans were positive in group III; 69% in group II; 48% in group I (P&lt;0.001). Vesicoureteral reflux detected by contrast VCUG was more prevalent in the younger age groups. Although high grades of reflux (grade IV-V) correlated better with a positive DMSA renal scan, it did not reach a level of statistical significance (P&gt;0.05). RUS did not correlate with a positive DMSA renal scan in any age group.,11793131,2002
Nucl Med Commun,The utility of (99m)Tc-DMSA and Tc(99m)-EC scintigraphy for early diagnosis of ifosfamide induced nephrotoxicity.,A serious undesired effect of certain cytostatics is their nephrotoxicity. In this study, we investigated the toxic effects of ifosfamide and cisplatin by clinical and biochemical parameters in relation to (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) and Tc(99m)N, N-ethylenedicysteine (EC) renal scintigraphy. The indicators were urinary beta2-microglobulin levels, tubular resorption of phosphate, urinary protein and glucose excretion, glomerular filtration rate, urinary pH and osmolarity. Thirteen paediatric patients (seven boys and six girls), aged 2-16 years, were investigated. Five patients received only cisplatin, six patients were treated with ifosfamide and cisplatin and two with ifosfamide and carboplatin for various malignancies. All except three patients had normal DMSA uptake (median, 19; range, 16-29%) prior to chemotherapy. The reduction in DMSA uptake was unilateral due to tumour invasion in those three patients. Following chemotherapy, DMSA uptake showed reduction in five patients with or without clinical nephrotoxicity. The observed pattern was decreased renal uptake and elevated bladder activity. Three patients with decreased DMSA uptake had normal tubular maximum phosphate reabsorption, which suggested subclinical injury. Decrease in DMSA uptake and tubular phosphate reabsorption (TPR) was detected simultaneously in two patients. No abnormalities were seen on Tc(99m)-EC scintigraphy to suggest nephrotoxicity in our investigation. However, Tc(99m)-EC clearly demonstrated a reduction in split renal function in children with tumour invasion. In summary, we found that ifosfamide induced tubular injury can be detected with (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy before chemotherapy associated nephrotoxicity is observed by laboratory measurements. Our results also imply that, although a tubular agent, renal scintigraphy performed with Tc(99m)-EC is not able to detect subclinical injury or predict the outcome during treatment.,11711903,2001
Radiology,Renal fibrosis: prediction from acute pyelonephritis focus volume measured at 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid SPECT.,PURPOSE: To evaluate whether acute pyelonephritis lesion volume derived from acute technetium 99m ((99m)Tc) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) images is predictive of the development of subsequent renal fibrosis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with acute pyelonephritis underwent (99m)Tc DMSA renal SPECT during acute infection and 6-10 months later. At quantitative analysis, the volume of photopenic lesions and the ratio of radioactivity in the photopenic lesion to that in normal renal tissue were calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were determined.RESULTS: Sixty-nine acute pyelonephritis foci in 44 children were analyzed. Thirty-seven (54%) of these lesions were normal on follow-up renal scans, while 32 (46%) developed scars. Significant differences in the photopenic lesion volume were found between the two groups (P &lt; .001). When photopenic lesion volume indicated a positive diagnosis (&gt;or=4.6-cm(3) lesion volume), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive, and negative predictive values were 96.7%, 92.3%, 90.6%, and 97.3%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Quantitative analysis of acute DMSA renal SPECT findings is valuable in predicting renal fibrosis. The volume of an acute pyelonephritis lesion is useful in predicting the development of fibrosis.,11687677,2001
An Esp Pediatr,[Acute lobar nephronia. Report of 3 new cases].,We present three patients, aged 4, 6 and 8 years old, with a diagnosis of urinary tract infection. In all patients, initial ultrasonographic studies revealed a single area of acute lobar nephronia (ALN). The patients underwent renal scintigraphy with dimercaptosuccinic acid-99mTc (DMSA Tc 99m), which showed multiple foci with below normal uptake in both kidneys of two patients, consistent with bilateral multifocal bacterial nephritis. Although this entity has been reported together with ALN in adults, very few pediatric cases have been reported. We emphasize the diagnostic value of ultrasonography and renal scintigraphy.,11676905,2001
An Esp Pediatr,[First urinary tract infection in healthy infants: epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment].,BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections in infants. It presents certain peculiarities compared with other pediatric age groups in terms of symptomatology, diagnosis and the therapeutic approach employed to prevent sequels.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiology, clinical and laboratory findings, etiology, diagnosis and treatment of first-time UTI in healthy infants.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January and December 1999, we performed a retrospective study of 131 previously healthy infants admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of first-time UTI. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, urine dipstick, urinalysis and urine culture (vesical catheterization), blood cell count and PCR, kidney ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrogram and DMSA scintigraphy were reviewed.RESULTS: We studied 131 patients (median age: 90 days). In infants younger than 30 days, UTI was more prevalent in males. The most frequent symptom was fever (73.3 %). Seventy-one patients fulfilled the criteria for acute pyelonephritis. The presence of nitrituria was low. Escherichia coli was isolated in 90.1 % of the patients. Voiding cystourethrogram detected vesicoureteric reflux in 18.4 % of the patients. Scintigraphy revealed renal scarring in 15.1 %. No significant correlations were found between renal scarring in late scintigraphy and a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and/or alterations in the cystourethrogram.CONCLUSIONS: Fever was the main symptom. E. coli was the most commonly isolated microorganism. Nitrituria had low sensitivity in infants. Ultrasonography had low specificity. Scintigraphy showed the highest sensitivity and specificity in the detection of renal scarring. Predictability improved when scintigraphy was performed a few months after acute infection.,11578537,2001
Pediatr Nephrol,Acute renal cortical scintigraphy in children with a first urinary tract infection.,This prospective study, performed in 101 children with a first symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), evaluates the diagnostic value of clinical, biological, and ultrasound parameters in detecting children with acute renal infection documented by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. In children with a positive DMSA scan, mean C-reactive protein (CRP) was higher than in children with a normal DMSA scan (114+/-64 vs. 67+/-38 mg/dl, mean+/-SD, P=0.0002). The sensitivity and specificity of CRP was 64% and 68%, respectively. In children with severe kidney involvement, mean CRP and white blood count (WBC) were higher than in children with mild/moderate disease (151+/-83 vs. 92+/-55 mg/dl for CRP, P=0.0149; 20,100+/-6,854 vs. 15,023+/-6,145 WBC/ mm3 for WBC, P=0.0131). The sensitivity and specificity was 85% and 20% for CRP, and 77% and 18% for WBC, respectively. One or more areas of abnormal cortical echogenicity were documented in 3% of kidneys with positive DMSA scans. Dilatation of the collecting system was observed in 24% of kidneys. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography was 27% and 89%, respectively. In conclusion, clinical, biological, and ultrasound parameters do not accurately distinguish cystitis from pyelonephritis in children with UTI and do not identify children with severe renal damage. Accordingly, we recommend that DMSA scan should be added to the initial work-up of children with UTI.,11511988,2001
Pediatr Nephrol,Role of Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy in the diagnosis of culture negative pyelonephritis.,The aim of this work was to evaluate prospectively the proportion of children with a clinical and biological presentation of acute pyelonephritis, abnormal Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy and negative or equivocal urine cultures. All patients aged 6 weeks to 15 years suspected of acute pyelonephritis (APN) were admitted to the Paediatric Department and underwent Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy within 3 days after admission and at 6 months. Of 166 patients enrolled in the study, 15 (9%) had negative or equivocal urine culture despite clinical and scintigraphic evidence of APN. Of these 15 children, renal ultrasound was normal in 7 patients and vesicoureteric reflux was found in 9 patients. Control DMSA 6 months after acute episode showed the disappearance of cortical lesions in eight and partial improvement in four patients. In this prospective series, as many as 9% of patients with APN would have been missed on the basis of equivocal or negative urine cultures. It is suggested that Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy should be performed in children with severe infection without clear aetiology, especially in those with abnormal urinalysis.,11420916,2001
Pediatr Nephrol,Attitude of Belgian pediatricians toward strategy in acute pyelonephritis.,To investigate the attitude of Belgian pediatricians toward the management and treatment of children with suspected acute pyelonephritis, a short letter was sent to all Belgian pediatricians (1,200). It contained a brief description of a clinical case strongly suggestive of acute pyelonephritis followed by a series of questions centered on complementary examinations to be performed, need of hospitalization and treatment. A total of 583 responses were received (49%). In the acute phase, 99% of pediatricians perform urine cultures, 87% blood examinations, and 76% renal ultrasound. Dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) scintigraphy is performed during the acute phase by 37% and during follow-up by 32% of all pediatricians. A voiding cystogram is requested by 71%. Ambulatory treatment is considered by 30% of responders. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (44%) and trimethoprim/sulfonamide (22%) are the most frequently used oral antibiotics. Private pediatricians perform fewer examinations and more frequently consider ambulatory treatment of acute pyelonephritis, compared to pediatricians working in hospitals. Among Belgian pediatricians, attitudes toward the diagnosis and treatment of acute pyelonephritis are heterogeneous. This survey underlines the need for properly documented prospective studies for the evaluation of different treatment modalities in childhood acute pyelonephritis.,11261676,2001
Arch Dis Child,An audit of RCP guidelines on DMSA scanning after urinary tract infection.,AIM: To assess the outcome of imaging investigations carried out in children with urinary tract infection (UTI), to compare the investigations with national guidelines, and to assess the impact on management.METHODS: Retrospective review of inpatients and outpatients, aged 0-12 years, referred to the University Hospital of Wales Healthcare Trust between February 1997 and January 1998 with UTI. All children without bacterial evidence of UTI and children previously investigated for antenatal urological anomalies, major congenital anomalies, or UTI were excluded.RESULTS: A total of 164 children (51 boys, 113 girls) were included. Thirteen of 56 infants (23%) and 82/108 older children (76%) were diagnosed at home over one year. The prevalence of dilatation on ultrasound was 8%, renal scarring on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was 11%, and vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was 34% when investigations were carried out following guidelines published by the Royal College of Physicians. In children aged 1-6 years, the prevalence of scarring was 1/54 (2%) in those treated at home and 6/18 (33%) in inpatients.CONCLUSION: The low yield of positive results and lack of evidence of impact on management indicate that DMSA scanning, with all the implications of isotope exposure, intravenous injection, staff time, psychological trauma, and expense, could be omitted in children over 1 year with first simple UTI not sufficiently ill to be admitted to hospital. The low rate of detection of UTI in primary care in infants may represent under diagnosis.,11259232,2001
Bratisl Lek Listy,[Diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in childhood: comparison of ultrasonographic examination and renal scintigraphy using 99mTc DMSA].,THE CURRENT STATE: Infections of the urinary tract are a frequent paediatric problem. Their treatment requires to assess the localisation of infection within the uropoetic tract. Especially the acute pyelonephritis (AP) can lead to irreversible changes within the renal parenchyma and alteration of renal functions. Some imaging examinations can help in the assessment of the diagnosis of AP and contribute to appropriate therapy.</AbstractText>: THE CURRENT STATE: Infections of the urinary tract are a frequent paediatric problem. Their treatment requires to assess the localisation of infection within the uropoetic tract. Especially the acute pyelonephritis (AP) can lead to irreversible changes within the renal parenchyma and alteration of renal functions. Some imaging examinations can help in the assessment of the diagnosis of AP and contribute to appropriate therapy.SUBJECTIVE: The analysis of results gained from imaging examinations in children with AP was based on the comparison of used techniques and the assessment of their exploitation for the diagnosis of AP.METHODS AND MATERIAL: 38 children (17 girls and 21 boys at average age of 11.6 years) with clinical criteria of AP were subdued to ultrasonographic examination with B record (US-B) and ultrasonographic examination with energetic Doppler (US-D). Both methods were compared with the findings gained by use of renal scintigraphy 99mTc DMSA.RESULTS: The positive finding of AP was proved in 36 children (94.7%). The results of US-B proved AP in 14 children (36.8%) of the whole group of patients, i.e. in 38.8% with positive DMSA finding. US-D changes indicated AP in 15 children (39.4%) of the whole group, i.e. in 41.6% with positive DMSA finding. The sensitivity of both methods US-B and US-D appear to be low for the verification of changes in renal parenchyma in AP.CONCLUSION: Despite its advantages and availability, the gain from ultrasonographic examination in children suffering from AP is small. Clinical and laboratory criteria are fully sufficient for AP verification in common clinical practice. DMSA scintigraphy is a method of choice in complicated cases of AP.

Arch Dis Child,Randomised controlled trial of three day versus 10 day intravenous antibiotics in acute pyelonephritis: effect on renal scarring.,BACKGROUND: Acute pyelonephritis often leaves children with permanent renal scarring.AIMS: To compare the prevalence of scarring following initial treatment with antibiotics administered intravenously for 10 or three days.METHODS: In a prospective two centre trial, 220 patients aged 3 months to 16 years with positive urine culture and acute renal lesions on initial DMSA scintigraphy, were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg once daily) for 10 or three days, followed by oral cefixime (4 mg/kg twice daily) to complete a 15 day course. After three months, scintigraphy was repeated in order to diagnose renal scars.RESULTS: Renal scarring developed in 33% of the 110 children in the 10 day intravenous group and 36% of the 110 children in the three day group. Children older than 1 year had more renal scarring than infants (42% (54/129) and 24% (22/91), respectively). After adjustment for age, sex, duration of fever before treatment, degree of inflammation, presence of vesicoureteric reflux, and the patients' recruitment centres, there was no significant difference between the two treatments on renal scarring. During follow up, 15 children had recurrence of urinary infection with no significant difference between the two treatment groups.CONCLUSION: In children with acute pyelonephritis, initial intravenous treatment for 10 days, compared with three days, does not significantly reduce the development of renal scarring.,11207174,2001
Eur J Nucl Med,Reliability of DMSA for the diagnosis of renal parenchymal abnormality in children.,The objective of this study was to evaluate the variability of technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy interpretation by four nuclear medicine physicians for the diagnosis of renal parenchymal abnormality in children, and to compare variability among three different DMSA methods in clinical use: planar alone, single-photon emission tomography (SPET) alone, and planar with SPET. One hundred consecutive DMSA studies were independently interpreted 3 times by four participating nuclear medicine specialists from different departments and in random order. All scans were classified by the presence or absence of renal parenchymal abnormality using the modified four-level grading system of Goldraich. Indices of agreement were the percentage of agreement and the kappa statistic. Disagreement was analysed using children, kidneys and kidney zones (three zones per kidney). Using patients as the unit of analysis, agreement for planar and planar with SPET methods was 87%-88% (kappa 0.74) for the normal-abnormal scan classification. The corresponding agreement value for the SPET alone method was 78% (kappa 0.56). Similarly, substantial disagreement (disagreement &gt; or = 2 categories) occurred in 2.5% and 1.3% of comparisons between observers for planar alone and planar with SPET, respectively, but in 5.2% of comparisons for SPET alone. These results did not vary appreciably whether interpretation of patients, kidneys or kidney zones was compared. It is concluded that the four experienced nuclear medicine physicians showed substantial agreement in the interpretation of planar alone and planar with SPET DMSA scintigraphic images. Interpretation of SPET DMSA images, without planar images, was significantly more variable than interpretation using the two other methods, disagreement occurring in more than 20% of comparisons. SPET DMSA scintigraphy, when used without planar images, does not provide a firm basis for clinical decision making in the care of children who may have renal damage. There is no apparent benefit of reduced variability from the extra provision of SPET data to nuclear medicine physicians who already have planar images.,11105816,2000
Turk J Pediatr,Thoracic ectopic kidney in a child: a case report.,Congenital thoracic ectopic kidney is a very rare developmental anomaly and the rarest form of all ectopic kidneys. It is usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on a routine chest radiography. We report a thoracic ectopic kidney in a 19-month-old boy, which initially presented as a well demarcated mass at the base of the right lung on chest x-ray. Intravenous pyelography (IVP) and thoraco-abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a normal functioning transdiaphragmatic thoracic ectopic right kidney, but technetium-99m DTPA and DMSA scintigraphy demonstrated pelvic stasis. We hereby discuss the features of congenital thoracic ectopic kidney and review the literature. Although it is extremely rare, thoracic ectopic kidney should be considered in differential diagnosis of a mass with a well demarcated superior margin in the lower part of the thorax, and renal scintigraphy must be performed even if CT and IVP results are normal.,11105630,2000
An Esp Pediatr,[Technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in the first febrile urinary tract infection in children].,OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the findings of 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy in children with their first acute febrile urinary tract infection in relation with several clinical-biological parameters and other imaging studies and a long-term follow up.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 103 children between 1 month and 10 years old with their first acute febrile urinary tract infection were studied by means of clinical and laboratory assessment, renal ultrasonography and 99mTc DMSA renal scintigraphy in the acute illness period. Patients were divided into two groups, those under 2 years old (n = 63) and those over 2 years old (n = 40).RESULTS: Cortical scintigraphy showed renal changes in 56 patients (54,5%). Children over 2 years of age had a higher incidence of renal lesions than younger children (39,7% vs. 77,5%). Ultrasonography measuring renal volume showed a simple concordance with scintigraphy in 64% of the patients. Reflux was demonstrated in 23 patients (22,3%) without differences between patients with normal or abnormal cortical scintigraphy. After having studied the factors that were associated independently to the pathological results in the scintigraphy through a logistical multivariant regression, it was observed that the child's age, the elevation of the PCR and the alterations of the renal volume were significant according to statistics and also associated to a larger amount of pathological DMSA scintigraphy.CONCLUSIONS: DMSA scintigraphy associated with other diagnostic methods can improve the sensitivity and specificity to establish renal damage stage. During the follow-up the acute lesions disappeared or improved in all cases and the chronic lesions have not been modificated.,11003855,2000
Clin Pediatr (Phila),UTI: diagnosis and evaluation in symptomatic pediatric patients.,We retrospectively reviewed data on 260 hospitalized pediatric patients with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). To ascertain the colony-forming units (CFU)/mL compatible with the diagnosis of UTI, a culture from a catheterized urine specimen containing &gt;1,000 CFU/mL was considered diagnostic of UTI and resulted in imaging by renal ultrasound, voiding cystourethrography, and renal nuclear scan with Tc99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). A positive DMSA renal scan is indicative of pyelonephritis. We used logistic regression analysis to determine which patient characteristics were predictive of pyelonephritis. We determined that, in hospitalized pediatric patients, the colony count of the positive urine culture, the type of organism grown in culture, and the voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) result (positive or negative for vesicoureteral reflux) did not predict which patients had pyelonephritis. In females, advancing age of the patient and positive renal ultrasound results were predictive of which patients had pyelonephritis when we controlled for other factors. We feel this emphasizes the importance of a thorough evaluation of hospitalized symptomatic patients, including patients with colony counts of 1,000 to 50,000 CFU/mL, to locate the level of infection and plan appropriate therapy.,10961818,2000
Pol Merkur Lekarski,[Renoscintigraphy applied with etylenedicysteine labeled with technetium 99m and SPECT technique as a method of examining kidneys in children with vesicoureteric reflux].,Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) can lead to renal parenchymal damage. Renal scarring is an important cause of chronic renal failure and hypertension in children. The significance of possible effects determines the necessity of early diagnosis of urinary tract pathology. The aim of the paper was to evaluate the morphology and function of kidneys with VUR using selected radioisotope techniques, and to compare the sensitivity of planar technique and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) technique in detection of renal scarring. In 45 children with VUR the following test were performed: ultrasonography, renoscintigraphy with technetium-99m-ethylenedicysteine (EC-Tc-99m) and technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA-Tc-99m) scintigraphy with planar and SPECT mode. Stage of VUR correlates with stage of cortical lesions estimated as a value of effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) in kidney, as well as scarring intensity in static scintigraphy. The use of SPECT increases sensitivity of examination for detection small, single scars. It seems that SPECT should be used more frequently in children in the group of scarring risk. That would allow for earlier diagnosis of renal scarring, enabling efficient treatment. Due to the correlation between ERPF and parameters obtained in DMSA scintigraphy, renoscintigraphy with EC-Tc-99m may be applied to monitor the progress of renal scarring.,10897634,2000
J Nucl Med,How accurate is dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis? A meta-analysis of experimental studies.,The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and to compare the test performance of the standard technique, planar DMSA, with the newly introduced technique, SPECT DMSA.</AbstractText>: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and to compare the test performance of the standard technique, planar DMSA, with the newly introduced technique, SPECT DMSA.METHODS: All published animal studies in which DMSA scintigraphy was compared with histopathology, the reference standard for acute pyelonephritis, were identified using a comprehensive search strategy with the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Test performances of all DMSA methods and SPECT versus planar DMSA were analyzed using summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves.RESULTS: Seven studies were identified, including 2 of SPECT DMSA. Problems in study design or reporting were common, with numerical errors in 4 studies. Overall, at a sensitivity of 86%, specificity was estimated to be 91%. Detection of acute pyelonephritis was at a lower threshold for SPECT than for planar DMSA (sensitivity/specificity values of 97%0/66% compared with 82%/ 97%), and the overall test performance of SPECT was not demonstrably better than that of planar DMSA. When applied to a group of children with a prevalence of renal damage of 40%, this means that 98% of children with abnormal planar DMSA scans will have renal damage, whereas only 65% of those with abnormal SPECT scans will have renal damage. Planar and SPECT DMSA will miss 11% and 3% of children with renal damage, respectively. Out of 100 children in the hypothetical group with 40% experiencing renal damage, SPECT will identify 6 extra true cases of renal damage at the expense of 19 extra false positives, when compared with planar DMSA.CONCLUSION: Published studies of DMSA test performance are few in number and have significant methodologic problems that should be avoided in future studies. DMSA, particularly the planar technique, performs well for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. Using test performance criteria, SPECT DMSA alone has not been shown to be preferable to the established planar method and will result in a small number of true-positives at the expense of a larger number of false-positives.,10855622,2000
Arch Dis Child,Risk assessment of renal cortical scarring with urinary tract infection by clinical features and ultrasonography.,AIMS: To address some of the issues in the ongoing debate over the optimal diagnostic imaging following childhood urinary tract infection (UTI), by determining the risk of missing renal cortical scarring which would be detected on a technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) gold standard if ultrasound alone were used, factoring for clinical features (upper or lower tract), UTI recurrence, and age group (infants, preschool, or school age).METHODS: Details of UTI clinical features and recurrence were recorded for 990 children with a proven UTI, and their DMSA and ultrasound results were compared for each kidney.RESULTS: The risks of missing DMSA scarring varied between 0.4% (school age children with solitary lower tract UTI) and 11.1% (infants with recurrent upper tract UTI).CONCLUSIONS: UTI clinical features are important in assessing the need for DMSA imaging. Current UK imaging guidelines are endorsed, although preschool children with solitary lower tract UTI remain a controversial group and more attention needs to focused on children with recurrent UTI.,10799427,2000
Ann Nucl Med,Reappraisal of Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy for follow up in children with vesicoureteral reflux.,We reviewed Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in order to assess whether repeated Tc-99m DMSA scans are necessary for the follow up of these patients. Ninety-seven children who were followed up for more than one year (1-7.4 years, average 2.8 years) after the first DMSA scan were included in the study. Fifty-one patients had been diagnosed as primary VUR and 46 as secondary VUR. Age at the first examination ranged from 0 to 14 years (average 5.1 years). Planar images were taken 2 hours after injection. The % renal uptake per injected dose (%RU) was calculated from posterior images. Kidneys in 11 patients (11.3%) changed morphologically during the follow up. Of these, new photon deficient areas (PD) were detected in only 4 patients (4.1%). All of these 4 patients had neurogenic bladder and were managed with self-catheterization. Of the remaining 7 patients, cortical thinning progressed in 5 patients (5.2%) and PDs resolved in 3 patients (3.1%). In one of these 7 patients, PD resolved in one kidney and cortical thinning progressed in the contralateral kidney. Of 97 patients reviewed, % RU decreased more than 20% during the follow up in 6 patients (6.2%). All were diagnosed as secondary VUR due to neurogenic bladder. %RU decreased only in the contracted kidneys at the initial scan. Two of them underwent renal transplantation because of severe renal failure. In conclusion, new PD rarely developed and % RU decreased in only a few patients during the follow up of children with VUR. Repeated Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy therefore seems to have little benefit in the follow up of children with VUR. It should be performed in selected patients with high risk of urinary tract infection or renal failure.,10656274,2000
Pediatrics,Polymorphonuclear elastase as a diagnostic marker of acute pyelonephritis in children.,OBJECTIVE: Experimental evidence suggests that neutrophils and their metabolites play an important role in the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of polymorphonuclear elastase-a(1)-antitrypsin complex (E-a(1)-Pi) for the detection of acute pyelonephritis in children.METHODS: Eighty-three patients, 29 boys and 54 girls, 25 days to 14 years of age, with first-time symptomatic urinary tract infection were prospectively studied. Fifty-seven healthy children served as controls. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and voiding cystourethrography were performed in all patients. Plasma and urinary E-a(1)-Pi, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), neutrophil count, urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase b (NAG b), and creatinine levels were measured in all patients on admission and 3 days after the introduction of antibiotics. The same markers were also measured in the control subjects.RESULTS: Planar DMSA scintigraphy demonstrated changes of acute pyelonephritis in 30 of 83 children (group A). It was normal in the remaining 53 children (group B). The sex and age distributions were not significantly different between the 2 groups, as well as between the patients and the control subjects (group C). Nineteen of the 53 children with a normal DMSA had body temperature &gt;/=38 degrees C, whereas all but 4 children with abnormal DMSA had temperature &gt;/=38 degrees C. Therefore, the temperature was significantly different between these 2 groups. The sensitivity and specificity of fever (&gt;/=38 degrees C) as an indicator of renal involvement based on isotopic findings were 86% and 64%, respectively. Given the significant number of the febrile children with normal DMSA scintiscans, group B was subdivided into B(1) with 19 febrile children (14 boys and 5 girls) and B(2) with 34 children whose body temperature was below 38 degrees C (8 boys and 26 girls). The sex and age distribution was significantly different between groups B(1) and B(2). The mean age of group B(1) was.78 years (range: 28 days to 9 years; median:.25 years; standard deviation: 2.1). All but 1 child in this group were younger than 1 year of age. In contrast, in group B(2), there were only 4 infants, the remaining 30 children were older than 2.5 years (mean age: 6 years; median: 7 years; standard deviation: 3.5; range: 34 days to 12 years). The mean duration of fever before hospital admission was 2.8 days for group A and 1.8 days for group B(1). This difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, body temperature was not significantly different between these 2 groups. The distribution of plasma E-a(1)-Pi values was normal in the control subjects. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma E-a(1)-Pi, as an indicator of renal involvement, were 96% and 50%, respectively, taking the 95th percentile of the reference range as a cutoff value. However, considering as a cutoff value the level of 72 microg/dL (95th percentile of group B(2)), its sensitivity and specificity were 74% and 86%, respectively. Plasma E-a(1)-Pi levels were significantly elevated in group A compared with group B and in both groups, the plasma E-a(1)-Pi values were significantly higher than in the control subjects. A significant difference also was noticed between group A and each of the subgroups B(1) and B(2) and also between the subgroups themselves. Plasma E-a(1)-Pi concentrations correlated significantly with neutrophil count in groups A (r =.3), B (r =.4), and B(2) (r =.46), but the correlation was not significant in group B(1.) ESR levels showed, among the different groups, similar differences with those of E-a(1)-Pi values. Unlike E-a(1)-Pi, CRP levels were comparable between groups A and B(1), which both consisted of febrile children. Neutrophil count was not significantly different between subgroups B(1) and B(2).

Acta Paediatr Suppl,Imaging of renal scarring.,Children with urinary tract infection should be investigated and followed up, as those with pyelonephritis may develop renal scarring. In this review, after discussing the advantages and disadvantages of various imaging modalities for diagnosis of renal scarring, it is concluded that DMSA scintigraphy and urography can both be used to detect significant renal scarring. With DMSA scintigraphy, small renal lesions (functional uptake defects) not seen at urography will also be detected. The long-term clinical significance of these lesions is, as yet, unknown. A normal DMSA scintigraphy after infection indicates low risk for clinically significant damage. In order to allow acute, reversible lesions to first disappear, a follow-up DMSA examination should not be performed until at least 6 mo after the acute infection. Ultrasonography in isolation cannot be recommended for the diagnosis of renal scarring.,10588267,1999
Pediatr Radiol,Potential utility of MRI in the evaluation of children at risk of renal scarring.,BACKGROUND: Gadolinium-enhanced MRI has recently been employed in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. Its potential utility in the diagnosis of renal scars in children is unknown. Objective. To evaluate the potential utility of MRI using fat-saturated T1-weighted (T1-W) and post-gadolinium, short-tau inversion-recovery (STIR) sequences in detecting renal scarring by comparison with technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99 m)Tc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy in children at risk of renal scarring.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 24 children with spina bifida and neurogenic bladder or anorectal anomaly was studied. No patient had a history of acute pyelonephritis. Documented urinary tract infection (UTI) was present in 10 children (42 %). The remaining 14 (58 %) children had a history of asymptomatic bacteriuria. None had clinical signs or symptoms of acute UTI at the time of the study. (99 m)Tc-DMSA and MRI were performed to detect renal scarring. (99 m)Tc-DMSA scans were supplemented with pinhole imaging. MRI of the kidneys employed a fat-saturated T1-W sequence and a post-gadolinium STIR sequence employing a short echo time.RESULTS: Of the kidneys studied, 33 % (n = 16) had evidence of a renal parenchymal defect suggestive of scarring on (99 m)Tc-DMSA. The concordance in the detection of a scarred kidney by post-gadolinium STIR sequence and (99 m)Tc-DMSA is 94 %; that by fat-saturated T1-W sequence and (99 m)Tc-DMSA is 82 %; that by both sequences (positive result on either sequence) and (99 m)Tc-DMSA is 100 %. Using (99 m)Tc-DMSA as the gold standard, MRI had a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 78 % in the diagnosis of a scarred kidney. The concordance in the detection of a scarred zone by post-gadolinium STIR sequence and (99 m)Tc-DMSA is 68 %; that by fat-saturated T1-W sequence and DMSA is 44 %; that by both sequences (positive result on either sequence) and (99 m)Tc-DMSA is 84 %. MRI had a sensitivity of 84 % and a specificity of 86 % in the diagnosis of a scarred zone, using (99 m)Tc-DMSA as the gold standard.CONCLUSION: The detection rate for renal scarring on MRI using the fat-saturated T1-W and post-gadolinium STIR sequences is comparable to planar (99 m)Tc-DMSA. MRI is of potential utility in the evaluation of children at risk of renal scarring.,10552069,1999
Clin Nucl Med,The value of Ga-67 renal SPECT in diagnosing and monitoring complete and incomplete treatment in children with acute pyelonephritis.,PURPOSE: This study evaluated the utility of Ga-67 renal SPECT for diagnosing acute pyelonephritis (APN) in children and monitoring them.METHODS: Seventy-one children (ages 1 week to 12 years) who were thought clinically to have APN were included in the study. The disease was considered present if the patients had all of the following: fever (38.5 degrees C), pyuria (leukocyte counts/per high-power field &gt; or = 10), and a positive result of a urinary culture or blood culture. Tc-99m DMSA, Ga-67 renal SPECT, and voiding cystourethrography were performed, with informed consent from the patients' parents, within 3 days after hospitalization. Three months after treatment, Tc-99m DMSA and Ga-67 renal SPECT were repeated in those patients who had abnormal results of the initial Ga-67 renal SPECT.RESULTS: In the diagnostic study, Ga-67 renal SPECT was superior to DMSA renal SPECT in detecting lesions (97% vs. 79%). Three children had false-negative results with Ga-67 renal SPECT. Seventeen kidneys were negative with Tc-99m DMSA but positive with Ga-67 renal SPECT. No patients had any Ga-67 uptake on post-therapy imaging. However, 32 of 107 kidneys (30%) had permanent renal scars. In these 107 kidneys, 78 (73%) were associated with high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR; VUR grade &gt; or = 3) and 29 (27%) with low-grade or no VUR.CONCLUSIONS: High-grade VUR tends to be associated more with APN than has been reported by others, probably because of an underestimation of APN by ultrasonography or DMSA. Ga-67 renal SPECT is sensitive and useful not only in diagnosis but also for monitoring and follow-up of children with clinical suspicion of APN, especially in those with equivocal results after DMSA renal SPECT studies.,10478742,1999
Br J Radiol,How sensitive is ultrasound in the detection of renal scars?,The English language medical literature was reviewed to determine the strength of the published evidence for the assertion that dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) is superior to ultrasound (US) in the detection of established renal scarring in children. The MEDLINE database was used to identify papers published between 1985 and 1997 that claimed to be concerned with the detection of scars, and contained sufficient information to permit calculation of the sensitivity of US relative to DMSA. Only 10 studies were identified. The sensitivity of US for scarring, using DMSA as a gold standard, ranged from 37% to 100%, and its specificity from 65% to 99%. These wide ranges mean that evaluation of the role of US in the detection of scarring remains controversial. All papers contained methodological flaws. Allowing for these, the sensitivity of US appears to be acceptable. Further research that avoids these methodological problems is required.,10474494,1999
J Urol,The role of 99mtechnetium dimercapto-succinic acid renal scans in the evaluation of occult ectopic ureters in girls with paradoxical incontinence.,PURPOSE: We describe the use of 99mtechnetium (Tc) dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy to document poorly functioning and/or ectopic renal units associated with occult ectopic ureters.MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the last 8 years 6 toilet-trained girls were referred for lifelong continuous urinary dribbling. Initial radiological evaluation included renal and bladder sonography in 6, excretory urography in 4, a mercaptoacetyltriglycine-3 renal scan in 1 and cystovaginoscopy in 2. Ultimately a 99mTc-DMSA renal scan was performed in all 6 girls before surgical intervention.RESULTS: Sonography failed to establish the diagnosis of ureteral ectopia in all cases, and revealed a normal solitary kidney in 3, normal kidneys in 1, an apparently uncomplicated unilateral duplication without hydroureteronephrosis in 1 and a contralateral uncomplicated duplication in 1. Excretory urography in 4 cases was inconclusive and showed a solitary kidney in 1, ipsilateral duplication without a normal appearing upper pole collecting system in 1, contralateral uncomplicated duplication in 1 and normal kidneys in 1. A mercaptoacetyltriglycine-3 renal scan in another girl with a solitary kidney on sonography failed to demonstrate a contralateral small ectopic kidney. Cystovaginoscopy performed in 2 patients by other pediatric urologists was nondiagnostic. 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy was diagnostic in all 6 cases, and revealed a small poorly functioning ectopic kidney in 3 and a poorly functioning dysplastic upper pole moiety in 3, which were consistent with a diagnosis of ureteral ectopia. An ectopic ureter was confirmed by cystoscopic and surgical findings in all girls.CONCLUSIONS: 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy reliably detects and localizes hypoplastic ectopic kidneys and poorly functioning upper pole moieties associated with occult ectopic ureters in girls with continuous urinary leakage.,10458388,1999
J Infect Dis,Increased urine interleukin-6 concentrations correlate with pyelonephritic changes on 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans in neonates with urinary tract infections.,Interleukin (IL)-6 and -8 are important inflammatory cytokines in bacterial infections. Their serum and urine concentrations were measured in 27 neonates with urinary tract infection (UTI) at onset and the second week of therapy, as well as in 23 control neonates. Escherichia coli was isolated in 89% of cases. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scans were performed between the 10th and 90th days after UTI and showed pyelonephritic changes in 15 neonates (56%). Increased IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were found in urine but not in serum within the first 24 h after presumptive diagnosis of UTI (P=.036 and.010, respectively), suggesting that the neonatal urinary tract can respond to uropathogens by producing inflammatory cytokines. Urine concentrations of IL-6 correlated with findings of renal changes in 99mTc-DMSA scans (P=.012) and thus may serve as a marker of renal parenchymal outcome. All neonates exhibited undetectable urine cytokine levels during the second week of therapy.,10438391,1999
Pediatr Nephrol,Comparison of ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy changes in acute pyelonephritis.,The strategy for morphological investigations in children with acute pyelonephritis (APN) remains debatable. We studied 70 children (median age 2.0 years) admitted with a first episode of pyelonephritis using a high-resolution ultrasound technique (RUS) and compared the results with 99m technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy. The DMSA scan was abnormal in 62 children (89%). However, using a high-frequency transducer we found abnormal sonogram changes in 61 children (87%), consisting of an increased kidney volume in 42, and/or a thickening of the wall of the renal pelvis in 42, and/or a focal hyper- or hypoechogenicity in 36, and/or a diffuse hyperechogenicity in 31 children. Micturating cystourethrography was performed in all children, revealing vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in 22 (31%). Among those children with VUR, 4 had a normal DMSA scan, 2 an abnormal RUS, and 2 a normal DMSA scan and RUS. Our data suggest that B-mode RUS performed with a high-frequency transducer by a trained radiologist is nearly as sensitive as the DMSA scan in diagnosing renal involvement in children with unobstructed APN and in predicting VUR.,10353409,1999
Urology,Utility of SPECT DMSA renal scanning in the evaluation of children with primary vesicoureteral reflux.,OBJECTIVES: DMSA renal scanning is more sensitive than ultrasound in detecting renal parenchymal scars. We proposed to determine the utility of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scanning in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).METHODS: During a 24-month period, we evaluated the charts of 368 patients who had undergone SPECT DMSA renal scanning for primary VUR. Patients were divided into three age groups: (a) less than 1 year, (b) between 1 and 5 years, and (c) older than 6 years. Renal scars were deemed severe or focal. The data were analyzed to evaluate the utility of SPECT DMSA scanning in children with primary VUR and to determine the indications for performing SPECT DMSA. We also evaluated the sensitivity of recent renal ultrasound technology in detecting focal and diffuse scars.RESULTS: One hundred twenty-eight patients were younger than 1 year at presentation. These included 24 cases that were detected prenatally. One hundred eighty-five were between the ages of 1 and 5 years, and 55 were 6 years or older. Reflux nephropathy at presentation was found in 99 (26.9%) of 368 patients. DMSA scanning changed the treatment in only 13 patients (3.5%). When scarring was diffuse, ultrasound examination correlated 100% with DMSA scanning; when focal scarring was present, the correlation was poor.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that DMSA scans should be tailored to children who have ultrasound abnormalities, high-grade reflux, or recurrent breakthrough urinary tract infections. These guidelines will result in a substantial cost savings and a significant decrease in radiation exposure.,10223500,1999
Pediatr Radiol,Renal sinus hyperechogenicity in acute pyelonephritis: description and pathological correlation.,This paper reports on the association between renal sinus hyperechogenicity and acute pyelonephritis. The medical records and imaging studies of 18 children displaying this pattern were retrospectively studied. Thickening of the renal pelvis and renal enlargement were the most frequent associated sonographic abnormalities. Further subtle findings can be found on sonography and colour/power Doppler. Their identification can help in the diagnostic approach to acute pyelonephritis and may obviate the need for other imaging modalities such as enhanced CT or 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy. Renal sinus hyperechogenicity was also identified in a parallel study performed in female rabbits with experimental pyelonephritis and was shown, histologically, to be related to exudates of fibrin and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, interstitial oedema and micro-abscesses.,10201035,1999
Clin Nucl Med,Identification of new renal scarring in repeated episodes of acute pyelonephritis using Tc-99m DMSA renal SPECT.,PURPOSE: This prospective study compared the value of Tc-99m DMSA renal planar scintigraphy with SPECT to detect new renal involvement in patients with repeated episodes of acute pyelonephritis (APN).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with suspected APN were transferred to our department for DMSA renal scans. Seventy-two children (ages 1 week to 15 years) had DMSA planar and SPECT imaging performed twice because of clinical or laboratory suspicion of repeated APN. In addition, radiographic voiding cystourethrography was also performed in all cases. The presence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was graded on a scale of 0 to 5.RESULTS: New lesions were observed with SPECT in 56 kidneys and with planar scintigraphy in 38 kidneys. No patients had a negative result of Tc-99m DMSA renal SPECT who also had a positive Tc-99m DMSA planar result. The degree of VUR as related to APN was diagnosed better with SPECT than with planar scintigraphy (46 compared with 30 and 10 compared with 8, respectively). There is a significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) between the diagnostic ability of these two methods to identify the increased tendency of repeated APN to occur with high-grade VUR compared with low-grade or no VUR.CONCLUSIONS: High-grade VUR is more commonly associated with renal injury than is low-grade or no VUR. If only Tc-99m DMSA renal planar scintigraphy is performed, renal scarring may be underestimated. Our results suggest that Tc-99m DMSA renal SPECT, rather than planar scintigraphy, should be used routinely in children with a clinical suspicion of APN, especially for those with scarred kidneys and high-grade VUR.,9858295,1998
Clin Nephrol,15-year follow-up of reflux nephropathy by imaging.,Reflux nephropathy i. e. renal scarring associated with vesico-ureteric reflux and urinary tract infection is primarily a diagnosis based on renal imaging. It is well known to be associated with hypertension and renal failure. This has led to regular long-term follow-up of patients, clinically and radiologically. We report the findings of renal imaging in a cohort of 37 patients with reflux nephropathy 15 or more years after successful surgical correction of vesico-ureteric reflux. The degree of renal scarring had been assessed and recorded at the beginning of the study utilizing a score on the original X-ray films. The scar scores of the current intravenous urography (IVU) imaging underestimate the degree of scarring in 35% of cases when compared with the previously recorded scar scores of the original IVU images suggesting a reduction in the renal scar score in some cases over the years. In the current review, concomitant renal images obtained by IVU and 99mTc dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA) scanning were in agreement for scar scoring in only 50% of cases. The original scar score by IVU or the current scar score by either technique does not correlate with blood pressure, urine albumin excretion or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We conclude that serial long-term two-dimensional renal imaging in children with damaged kidneys who no longer have vesico-ureteric reflux, does not provide additional information that will alter clinical management. However, the changes in renal volume and echogenicity were not assessed in this study.,9799067,1998
Ann Urol (Paris),[Urology and nuclear medicine in children. Experience from a series of 1200 renal scintigraphies].,During the last 4 years, we have performed 1200 renal scintigraphies in children under the age of 6 years: 57% of dynamic renal scintigraphies using MAG3 for antenatally diagnosed uropathies (mainly pelvic dilatations and megaureters), 36% of static renal scintigraphies using DMSA for renal sequelae of pyelonephritis with or without vesicoureteric reflux, and 6% of direct isotope cystography for follow-up of vesicoureteric reflux. Renal scintigraphy, which provides low radiation hazards (1 mSv), is now a major imaging modality for paediatric urinary tract disease.,9791546,1998
J Nucl Med,Variability in the interpretation of dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy after urinary tract infection in children.,Technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy is a frequently used diagnostic test in pediatric practice to assess the presence and severity of renal damage. Most commonly it is performed after urinary tract infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the variability in the interpretation of DMSA scans by pediatric nuclear medicine physicians in this clinical setting.</AbstractText>: Technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy is a frequently used diagnostic test in pediatric practice to assess the presence and severity of renal damage. Most commonly it is performed after urinary tract infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the variability in the interpretation of DMSA scans by pediatric nuclear medicine physicians in this clinical setting.METHODS: We selected all 441 scans from children with first-time urinary tract infection who presented between 1993 and 1995 to a pediatric casualty department and who are participants in a prospective cohort study. Two hundred and ninety-four scans were performed at a median time of 7 days after diagnosis, and 147 scans were from children who were free from further infection over a 1-yr follow-up period. Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians independently interpreted the 441 scans according to whether renal damage was present or absent and using the modified 4-level grading system for DMSA abnormality of Goldraich. Apart from being informed that urinary tract infection was the indication for DMSA scintigraphy, no other clinical information was given to the nuclear medicine physicians. The indices of variability used were the percentage of agreement and the kappa statistic. For the grading scale used, both measures were weighted with integers representing the number of categories from perfect agreement. Disagreement was analyzed for children, kidneys and kidney zones.RESULTS: There was agreement in 86% (kappa = 69%) for the normal-abnormal DMSA scan dichotomy, and the weighted agreement was 94% (weighted kappa = 82%) for the grading of abnormality. Disagreement of DMSA scan interpretation of &gt; or =2 grades was present in three cases (0.7%). The same high level of agreement was present for patient, kidney and kidney zone comparisons. Agreement was not influenced by age or timing of scintigraphy after urinary tract infection.CONCLUSION: Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians showed good agreement in the interpretation of DMSA scintigraphy in children after urinary tract infection and using the grading system of Goldraich.,9708522,1998
Br J Radiol,Comparison of radiation dose from intravenous urography and 99Tcm DMSA scintigraphy in children.,Intravenous urography (i.v.u.) and 99Tcm DMSA scintigraphy are possible alternative diagnostic techniques in paediatric renal investigation. Radiation dose comparisons between them have been complicated in the past by the lack of paediatric data. In this study, evaluations relevant to children are used to compare estimates of effective dose from the two techniques. For the radiographic procedures, standard operating parameters and representative age-dependent values of entrance surface dose were established from recent literature. Conversion factors relating effective dose to entrance surface dose and dose-area product are presented and used to obtain values of effective dose for single radiographs of abdomen, kidneys and pelvis. Suggested i.v.u. procedures consisting of four (&quot;minimum&quot;) or eight (&quot;average&quot;) radiographs were adopted to derive the effective dose for full i.v.u. examinations. 99Tcm DMSA dose estimates, taken from our published work using an administered activity schedule based on body surface area, are almost constant at about 1 mSv for all children. In comparison, mean i.v.u. doses based on the &quot;average&quot; number of radiographs are similar to DMSA doses for infants (&lt; 1 year) but may be twice as high for older children. Although the differences between procedures at this level of dose do not in themselves provide grounds for preference, when coupled with the lower diagnostic sensitivity of i.v.u. they suggest limitations of this procedure for detection of a renal scar.,9616242,1998
Arch Esp Urol,[Use of Tc 99m DTPA in the follow-up of 2 pediatric patients diagnosed with megacalycosis or Puigvert's disease].,OBJECTIVE: Megacalycosis or Puigvert's disease is a congenital anomaly of renal development characterized by caliceal dilatation, an increased number of calyces, associated with hypoplasia of the pyramids of Malpighi, and a normal renal pelvis. Renal function is always normal and there is no evidence of obstruction to urinary flow. The foregoing are important in distinguishing megacalycosis from congenital hydronephrosis. We have studied two pediatric patients with this renal anomaly by means of non invasive techniques, in order to demonstrate they had no urinary flow obstruction despite the caliceal dilatation.METHODS: Two cases of megacalycosis that had been diagnosed at our hospital from 1991 to 1995 are described and the literature is reviewed. Diagnosis was basically by intravenous urography. A diuretic renogram with technetium 99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Tc 99m DTPA) showed no urinary flow obstruction in the anomalous kidney. This test was repeated several times, together with renal function studies like the technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA Scan).RESULTS: Both patients are asymptomatic and have a normally functioning kidney with no scars demonstrable on the DMSA scan. Renal urinary flow studies have remained within the normal ranges (elimination of more than 40% of the radionuclide 20 min after the administration of furosemide). US control evaluations have shown adequate renal growth and persistent caliceal dilatation in both cases.CONCLUSIONS: This congenital malformation must be considered when investigating renal dilatation, since megacalycosis does not require surgical treatment. Intravenous urography is useful in the diagnosis of this condition and Tc 99m DPTA is the best test for subsequent control evaluations.,9412381,1997
J Nucl Med,Ifosfamide-induced alteration of technetium-99m-DMSA renal parenchymal imaging.,Renal cortical imaging with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has become the imaging test of choice for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. An unusual uptake pattern was observed in a child receiving chemotherapy for a bladder rhabdomyosarcoma. Chemotherapy from ifosfamide produces a specific pattern of injury to the renal tubule that alters uptake of DMSA.,9374361,1997
Pediatr Clin North Am,Urinary tract infections in children. Epidemiology, evaluation, and management.,Accurate documentation of UTIs in children is essential for proper evaluation and management. Urine cultures with multiple organisms or colony counts less than 50,000 to 100,000 CFU/ml should be considered suspect and require confirmation, particularly with clean-catch specimens. Children with well-documented UTIs should be evaluated based on their age and presenting symptoms. Infants and young children require imaging, usually with a cystogram and sonogram of the kidneys and bladder. Older girls with febrile UTIs and boys at any age should also be considered for urinary tract imaging. Renal cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA has emerged as the imaging study of choice for acute pyelonephritis and renal scarring in children with UTIs. Treatment of UTIs in children ideally commences with culture-specific antimicrobial therapy, although treatment may be started in sick children before culture results are available. Short-course treatment (3-5 days) is sufficient for children with acute uncomplicated lower UTIs. Children with acute pyelonephritis require 10 to 14 days of antibiotics, which can be administered on an outpatient basis in older infants and children who are not toxic, as long as good compliance is expected. Patients with first-time UTIs who require imaging should be maintained on low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis until their workup is completed. Treatment of ABU does not seem necessary if the urinary tract is otherwise normal. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for children with frequent symptomatic recurrences of UTI and for those with known VUR. Diagnosis and treatment of underlying voiding dysfunction and constipation is an essential component of the successful management of UTIs in children.,9326956,1997
J Urol,Estimation of differential renal function in children with a prenatal diagnosis of unilateral pelvic dilatation.,PURPOSE: We compared the estimation of differential renal function by 99mtechnetium (Tc)-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) and 99mTc-pentetic acid scintigraphic methods for followup of prenatally diagnosed unilateral renal pelvic dilatation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed differential renal function estimations calculated by static and dynamic methods in time matched test pairs that were included in the charts of 51 children monitored for prenatally diagnosed unilateral renal pelvic dilatation at our institution in a 5-year period.RESULTS: There were 96 test pairs with available archived raw data. Using the analytic method of assessment of agreement between the 2 tests, a 95% limit of agreement of +/-9% was calculated. Of the 96 pairs of tests the results of 94 revealed no significant difference. Subgroup analysis by patient age and operative intervention (13 postoperative pairs) also showed no difference in the results of the 2 tests.CONCLUSIONS: We established the 95% limits of agreement between 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-pentetic acid tests of differential renal function to be +/-9% discrepancy in 96 test pairs. During followup of prenatally diagnosed unilateral renal pelvic dilatation the assessment of differential renal function can be made by 99mTc-DMSA static or dynamic diuretic renography techniques. This interchangeability is consistent at all patient ages regardless of operative intervention. Since dynamic diuretic renography provides differential function and drainage data, using 99mTc-DMSA in this context is unnecessary and subjects patients to an unnecessary radiation burden.,9120961,1997
J Nucl Med,MAG3 SPECT: a rapid procedure to evaluate the renal parenchyma.,Renal parenchymal (cortical) scintigraphy (planar or SPECT) is indicated for the diagnosis and follow-up of focal functional disorders, such as acute pyelonephritis, and for accurate quantitation of split renal function, especially in cases of atypical location of the kidney(s). This static imaging procedure is currently performed 3-5 hr after the injection of a cortical fixation agent, 99mTc-DMSA or 99mTc-GH, and requires effective immobilization of the patient for 30 min.</AbstractText>: Renal parenchymal (cortical) scintigraphy (planar or SPECT) is indicated for the diagnosis and follow-up of focal functional disorders, such as acute pyelonephritis, and for accurate quantitation of split renal function, especially in cases of atypical location of the kidney(s). This static imaging procedure is currently performed 3-5 hr after the injection of a cortical fixation agent, 99mTc-DMSA or 99mTc-GH, and requires effective immobilization of the patient for 30 min.METHODS: In five healthy adult volunteers and five children with various clinical indications, SPECT renal parenchymal scintigraphy was performed with a three-detector camera in 1-min per revolution sequential intervals for a total acquisition time of 4 min, beginning immediately after an intravenous injection of a graduated dose of 20 mCi (minimum 2 mCi) of the dynamic renal agent 99mTc-MAG3.RESULTS: Tomograms of the renal parenchyma reconstructed in three projections and volume-rendered reprojection of the SPECT-volume data indicated normal or abnormal renal parenchyma. Comparisons were made with planar MAG3 and SPECT-GH and favored MAG3-SPECT. However, comparisons with DMSA indicated certain disadvantages of MAG3 SPECT. For most organs, the radiation dose estimates from 20 mCi MAG3 were lower than those from DMSA (6 mCi) or GH (20 mCi). Simultaneous injection of MAG3 and a diuretic (2-40 mg furosemide) resulted in lower than usually reported radiation dose estimates for the urinary bladder (target organ) and the gonads, and allowed subsequent evaluation of the drainage system.CONCLUSION: MAG3 SPECT is feasible, clinically useful and may be offered as a rapid (4 min) renal parenchymal imaging procedure, or it may precede planar dynamic (dluretic) MAG3 scintigraphy.,9074543,1997
Pediatr Nephrol,The evaluation of acute pyelonephritis and renal scarring with technetium 99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy: evolving concepts and future directions.,Technetium 99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy has emerged as the imaging agent of choice for the detection and evaluation of acute pyelonephritis and renal cortical scarring in children. Consequently, DMSA scintigraphy provides a unique opportunity to study the progression of renal damage and functional loss from the initial insult of acute pyelonephritis to the subsequent development of irreversible renal scarring. Over the last few years, clinical and experimental investigations using DMSA renal scintigraphy have provided new insights into the etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical outcome of acute pyelonephritis in children. These studies have confirmed the primary role of the acute inflammatory response, associated with both reflux and nonreflux pyelonephritis, in the etiology of irreversible renal scarring. Furthermore, several studies have shown that renal scarring can be prevented or diminished by the early diagnosis and treatment of pyelonephritis. This review highlights these recent observations and makes recommendations regarding current clinical and future research applications.,9035184,1997
Pediatr Radiol,Imaging of pyelonephritis.,OBJECTIVE: Accurate diagnosis of pyelonephritis using clinical and laboratory parameters is often difficult, especially in children. The main aims of this prospective study were to compare the value of different imaging techniques [renal sonography, cortical scintigraphy with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc DMSA) and computed tomography (CT)] in detecting renal involvement in acute urinary tract infections and to determine the sensitivity of DMSA scans for permanent renal scars 6 months later.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 1992 and January 1993, 55 children admitted to our pediatric unit with febrile symptomatic urinary tract infections were eligible for analysis. Ultrasonography (US), DMSA scanning and micturating cystourethrography were performed in every case. Only 18 children underwent CT. A second DMSA scan was performed in 48 children a mean of 7.5 months after the first.RESULTS: US abnormalities were found in 25 children (45 %). The first DMSA scan showed a parenchymal aspect suggestive of pyelonephritis in 51 patients (93 %). Among the 18 patients studied by CT, 14 had abnormalities. Normal US findings did not rule out renal parenchymal involvement. Scintigraphy appeared to be more sensitive than CT for renal involvement. The frequency and degree of initial renal parenchymal damage seemed to correlate with vesicoureteral reflux, but the most severe initial parenchymal defects were not associated with marked clinical or laboratory manifestations. Repeat DMSA scans, performed on 45 kidneys with abnormalities at the first examination, showed resolution in 19, improvement in 16, persistence in 8 and deterioration in 2. The prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux was not higher in patients with renal scarring on the second DMSA scan than in patients whose scans showed an improvement.CONCLUSION: DMSA scans should be considered as a reference in the detection and follow-up of renal scarring associated with acute urinary tract infection as this technique is more sensitive than US and CT, the latter being unsuitable because it entails radiation exposure and sedation of patients.,9028852,1997
Lancet,Are younger children at highest risk of renal sequelae after pyelonephritis?,BACKGROUND: The general belief about the relation between risk of renal sequelae after pyelonephritis and age is that infants are at highest risk and children older than 5 years at lower risk. This assumption has led to differences in treatment based on age. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the occurrence of renal lesions in children aged 0-16 years.METHODS: Between May, 1994, and January, 1996, all children aged 0-16 years who were admitted to our department with a diagnosis of probable pyelonephritis and a positive urine culture were included in this prospective study. All patients received antibiotics for 7-21 days. During the acute phase of urinary-tract infection, scintigraphy with technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and ultrasonography were done. Voiding cystourethrography was undertaken at least 6 weeks after the end of antibiotic treatment. When scintigraphy showed renal parenchymal lesions, repeat scintigraphy was done after at least 2 months to assess the progression of renal lesions. For the analysis, children were grouped by age according to presumed risk of renal sequelae after pyelonephritis: high risk (&lt; 1 year), moderate risk (1-5 years), low risk (&gt; 5 years).FINDINGS: 201 patients were enrolled in the study (119 &lt; 1 year, 47 aged 1-5 years, 35 &gt; 5 years). During the acute phase of urinary-tract infection, renal lesions were found in 66 (55%) infants under 1 year, in 37 (79%) children aged 1-5 years, and in 24 (69%) children older than 5 years. Of these 127 children, 108 underwent repeat scintigraphy after an average of 3 months (50 &lt; 1 year, 36 aged 1-5 years, 22 &gt; 5 years). Overall, renal scars were found on repeat scintigraphy in 20 (40%) infants under 1 year, in 31 (86%) children aged 1-5 years, and in 14 (64%) children older than 5 years. 38 (36%) of these 65 patients had vesicoureteric reflux. Among 88 children who had a first documented urinary-tract infection and underwent repeat scintigraphy, renal scars were found in 20 (43%) under 1 year, in 26 (84%) aged 1-5 years, and in eight (80%) older than 5 years.INTERPRETATION: This study did not confirm the conventional view that the risk of renal scars after pyelonephritis diminishes with age. We believe that all children, irrespective of age, will benefit from any measure that prevents the development of renal sequelae.,8988117,1997
Pediatr Infect Dis J,Urinary tract infections in young febrile children.,UTI is a common and important clinical problem in infants and young children, with a prevalence of 5.3% among febrile infants seen in our Emergency Department. White females with rectal temperature &gt; or = 39 degrees C are at particularly high risk (prevalence, 17%). Several studies have highlighted the limitations of the standard urinalysis for identifying UTI in infants and young children and have recommended performance of both urinalysis and urine culture. Alternative methods such as dipstick urinalysis, although attractive because of ease of performance, are inadequate as a screen for UTI. Hemocytometer WBC counts of an uncentrifuged urine specimen can be performed in an office or hospital-based laboratory with minimal training. Performance of Gram-stained smears, however, is most appropriate for the hospital-based laboratory. In the hospital setting where both tests can readily be performed, the positive predictive value of the combination of pyuria and bacteriuria (85%) allows prompt institution of antimicrobial therapy before culture results are available, whereas the lower positive predictive value of the single finding of either pyuria or bacteriuria (40%) justifies delaying treatment decisions until culture results are available. In the office setting where hemocytometer counts can easily be performed, culturing only specimens with pyuria and those of children presumptively treated with antimicrobials will result in the identification of almost all patients with true UTI, sparing large health care expenditures. Although the urine culture is traditionally regarded as the gold standard of UTI, positive urine cultures may occur secondary to contamination or in cases of ABU, leading to a false diagnosis of UTI. In contrast we found pyuria to be a reliable marker to discriminate infection from colonization of the urinary tract. The sustained absence of an inflammatory response, on repeat UA within 24 h, constitutes strong evidence that infection is absent. Management of ABU is controversial; many experts recommend withholding antibiotics because eradication of low virulence organisms may be followed by colonization with more virulent species that cause pyelonephritis. Preliminary results of our ongoing treatment trial suggest that management of young febrile children with UTI as outpatients receiving oral cefixime is as efficacious as inpatient management with intravenous cefotaxime. Results of renal ultrasound and DMSA scan at the time of infection have not modified management in any patient. Accordingly selective rather than routine performance of ultrasound is recommended. A voiding cystourethrogram at 1 month and a DMSA scan 6 months later have been valuable in identifying patients with vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring, respectively. Among patients initially identified as having acute pyelonephritis, the incidence of renal scarring at 6 months has been substantially more frequent (approximately 40%) than we had expected. However, the long term implications of small scars identified with renal scintigraphy remain to be determined.,9002094,1997
J Pediatr,Renal damage one year after first urinary tract infection: role of dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy.,OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether age, C-reactive protein (CRP), body temperature, or results of voiding cystourethrography at diagnosis of first-time symptomatic urinary tract infection could predict the risk of renal damage as evaluated by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy performed 1 year after the infection.DESIGN: The study included 157 children (median age, 0.4 year, range, 5 days to 5.8 years) with first-time symptomatic urinary tract infection. In children 1 year of age or older, a body temperature of 38.5 degrees C or higher was necessary for inclusion. CRP and body temperature were measured at the time of infection, and voiding cystourethrography was performed shortly thereafter. DMSA scintigraphy was performed 1 year later in all children.RESULTS: After 1 year, 59 (38%) of the 157 children had renal damage as evaluated by DMSA scintigraphy, and of these, 28 (47%) had reflux. There was a positive correlation between renal damage and CRP, body temperature, and reflux. Children with high levels of CRP, high fever, and dilating reflux had a risk of renal damage up to 10 times higher than children with normal or slightly elevated CRP levels, no or mild fever, and no reflux.CONCLUSION: CRP concentration and body temperature at the index infection, in combination with the results of voiding cystourethrography, are useful in classifying children at high and low risk of scintigraphic renal damage 1 year after urinary tract infection.,8969722,1996
Pediatr Med Chir,[Diagnostic value of renal scintigraphy in the neonatal period: presentation of some clinical cases].,The valuation of renal function using radiotracers represents an attractive methodology to value most renal and upper urinary tract diseases in newborns. Restrincting damage, lower irradiation and lack of dangerous side-effect are particularly desiderable in newborns. The radiotracers of choice in our studies were Tc-99m-labeled radiopharmaceutical (DTPA and DMSA), because of their favourable dosimetry. The given dose has been calculated according to the table set forth by the EAMN-Pediatric Task Group. We report some particular cases in which renal scintigraphy represented a good alternative in comparison with more injurious methods in diagnostic classification of newborns.,9053887,1996
Clin Nephrol,DMSA renal scans in adults with acute pyelonephritis.,The 99mTc-DMSA scan is accepted as the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting areas of renal parenchymal scarring. More recently the DMSA scan has also been shown to be of value in imaging areas of renal parenchymal involvement in both children and adults with acute pyelonephritis. We assessed the acute DMSA scan findings in a consecutive series of 81 patients hospitalized with acute pyelonephritis. Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed if the patient had a fever of &gt; 37.8 degrees C, loin pain or tenderness and infected urine (99% Escherichia coli). Patients had a blood culture taken (8 positive), as well as a hematological (leukocytosis 75%) and biochemical screen, C-reactive protein (CRP) (increased in 57 of 66 [86%]) and urinary tract ultrasonography. If the initial DMSA scan was abnormal it was repeated after three months and in some instances again at six months. If persisting defects were noted an intravenous urogram was then undertaken. Of the 81 patients, 37 (46%) had an abnormality on the DMSA scan. Nineteen had a single defect, 12 multifocal defects, five features suggestive of pre-existing renal parenchymal scarring (all later shown to have reflux nephropathy) and one a shrunken kidney. Those patients with an abnormal scan had a higher CRP concentration than those with a normal scan. Of the 31 patients who had either a focal or multifocal defect on their initial DMSA scan there was adequate follow-up on 24 patients. In 18 of these the defects had resolved by six months (usually within three months), while of the remainder, three were shown to have reflux nephropathy, one had a large single renal cyst and another an area of parenchymal calcification. Fifty-three of 76 patients (70%) had normal ultrasonography. In adults with acute pyelonephritis, the DMSA scan may prove to be the most useful renal imaging procedure.,8869786,1996
J Nucl Med,Technetium-99m-DMSA renal SPECT in diagnosing and monitoring pediatric acute pyelonephritis.,This study compares the sensitivity of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal SPECT with planar scintigraphy, concluding the importance of 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT for the early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) in patients under 3 yr of age.</AbstractText>: This study compares the sensitivity of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal SPECT with planar scintigraphy, concluding the importance of 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT for the early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) in patients under 3 yr of age.METHODS: Twenty-seven children under 3 yr of age, with clinical and/or laboratory suspicion of APN, were investigated. All 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT and planar images and voiding cystoureterogram (VCUG) were obtained within 3 days of hospitalization.RESULTS: In the first examination, renal cortical defects were detected in 23 patients (42 kidneys) with SPECT and in 9 patients (11 kidneys) with planar scintigraphy. One year after treatment, constant renal cortical lesions were observed in 11 patients (14 kidneys) with SPECT and 4 patients (4 kidneys) with planar scintigraphy. The high grades of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (grade &gt;or= 3) correlate better with APN diagnosed by SPECT (34 kidneys) than by planar scintigraphy (8 kidneys). Multiple renal cortical defects (number of lesions &gt;or= 4) were only seen in patients under 1.5 yr old and none of those with a negative 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT had a positive 99mTc-DMSA renal planar scintigraphy at any time. There is a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) between the diagnostic ability of these two methods of examination.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT should be used, where possible, instead of planar DMSA in routine examination of children with clinical suspicion of APN, especially for those under 3 yr of age.,8708770,1996
J Nucl Med,Radiation dosimetry of technetium-99m-DMSA in children.,Radiation dosimetry was performed on 24 children (aged 5 wk to 14.8 yr) who were undergoing routine diagnostic investigation of renal impairment with 99mTc-DMSA.</AbstractText>: Radiation dosimetry was performed on 24 children (aged 5 wk to 14.8 yr) who were undergoing routine diagnostic investigation of renal impairment with 99mTc-DMSA.METHODS: Organ doses were calculated using MIRDOSE 3 with biokinetic data obtained in previously described studies, and effective doses and effective dose equivalents were estimated. Interpolation by inverse weight between pediatric anthropomorphic phantoms was compared with age-matching to discrete phantoms. Administered activities were scaled by body surface area from the adult activity of 100 MBq and the resulting radiation doses in normal children were compared with those that would have resulted from a schedule based on body weight.RESULTS: The effective doses estimated by interpolation differed by up to 46% from those based on discrete phantoms and showed less variation. In children with normal bilateral renal function, the mean effective dose per administered activity was 0.91 +/- 0.08 mSv or 0.98 +/- 0.29 mSv by the two methods, respectively. Renal pathology reduced the effective dose, on average, by 15% of the value for normal patients.CONCLUSION: Over the pediatric age range, the uniformity of effective dose values was improved by scaling the administered activity according to body surface area rather than to body weight.,8708767,1996
Nucl Med Commun,Inter-observer agreement in the reporting of 99Tcm-DMSA renal studies.,The early identification of renal cortical scarring secondary to urinary reflux and/or renal infection is important in the management of patients with recurrent disease. Scintigraphic imaging of the renal cortex using 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is often considered the standard method for the diagnosis of renal scars in both adults and children. Consistent reporting of 99Tcm-DMSA is nevertheless essential in ensuring that the clinician can act on the data reported. In this study, seven experienced observers were asked to report, independently, 99Tcm-DMSA data sets from 32 patients. The observers were asked to note the presence of a space occupying lesion or of a renal cortical scar(s) and to conclude if the kidney was normal or abnormal. There was marked variation in the number of renal cortical scars reported, the total number of scars seen and whether or not the kidney was normal or abnormal. After peer review of all data, consensus and referenced criteria were arrived at for a reanalysis of data. All scans were reread by the observers. There was some improvement in the concordant reporting of kidneys with renal scars (51 vs 61%) and whether or not the kidney was normal or abnormal (53 vs 63%). However, this was not statistically significant (at a level of P &lt; 0.05). This study demonstrated significant inter-observer variation regarding the reporting of 99Tcm-DMSA studies. A consensus with agreed guidelines for data interpretation did not significantly affect this apparent lack of consistency of reporting.,8843119,1996
Presse Med,[Renal scintigraphy: a major test for urologic diseases in children].,The number of asymptomatic uropathies detected by ultrasound has increased dramatically with antenatal diagnosis. Some of them only threaten the renal parenchyma and require surgery. Therefore, screening for patients at risk is a major challenge. During the initial evaluation and follow up of a dilated system, MAG3 scans evaluate and quantify the physiologic significance of a radiologically detected anatomic abnormality by measuring the relative renal function and wash out of the radiopharmaceutical. Moreover, DMSA scans show renal functional abnormalities due to pyelonephritis or dysplasia associated with vesicoureteral reflux or obstructive uropathy. With a low radiation burden, renal scintigraphy is now a major imaging modality for uropathies in pediatrics.,8657669,1996
Pediatr Nephrol,Poor renal uptake of 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid and near-normal 99mtechnetium-mercaptoacetyltriglycine renogram in nephronophthisis.,Four patients with the clinical diagnosis of nephronophthisis are presented, all having a very poor renal uptake of 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) but clearly visualized kidneys on early images with 99mtechnetium-mercaptoacetyltriglycine and a normal or almost normal renogram. There was no difference between a young patient in an early stage of the disease and the other three patients with more advanced renal disease. In contrast, a patient with tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis had considerably better renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA despite impaired renal function. We suggest that the specific tubular function defect in nephronophthisis might be the cause of the poor uptake of 99mTc-DMSA. We also recommend the method to support the clinical suspicion of nephronophthisis, even in the early stages of the disease.,8703703,1996
Nucl Med Commun,A review of renal scarring in children.,It is now widely accepted that children with a proven urinary tract infection should undergo some form of diagnostic imaging to assess the presence of, or the potential to develop, renal scarring. The type of investigation which should be performed is controversial. Some centres still perform intravenous urography, others rely on ultrasound alone, while others believe that a 99Tc(m)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99Tc(m)-DMSA) scan is essential. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques by drawing from the extensive literature currently available. The consensus view is that a DMSA scan is the most sensitive method of detecting renal scarring and of highlighting the kidney at risk of developing scarring. It is hoped that wider early use of DMSA scintigraphy will lead to a fall in the number of children who develop end-stage renal disease.,8692483,1996
Cir Pediatr,[Surgery of ectopic ureterocele in children: strategy based on prenatal function].,From 1981 to 1993, we have treated 31 pediatric patients with ectopic ureterocele (associated to duplex system, intra and extravesicals). Diagnostic work-up included abdominal ultrasound, intravenous urography (IVU), sequence mictional cystouretrography (SM-CU) and diuresis renography (DTPA-DMSA o MAG-3). Patients were divided in two groups: 1. Good renal function in the affected system (5 cases) with 2 endoscopic incision of the ureterocele and 3 without surgical treatment (all intravesical). 2. Almost non-existent ipsilateral renal function (26 cases), treated by heminephrectomy and ureterocelic aspiration, and in the remaining a nephrectomy was done for ipsilateral non-existent renal function. 2 cases treated by endoscopic incision presented vesicoureteral reflux, and 4 cases treated by nephrectomy had a low grade reflux. There is no a definite treatment established. The choice should by made based on renal function. Endoscopic incision is a good choice in obstructed cases with good renal function. In those with no function at all, heminephrectomy with aspiration of the ureterocele will be the best treatment if we consider that almost 50 percent of the patients will need a second surgical procedure.,8527314,1995
Pediatr Nephrol,Update on dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scanning in children with urinary tract infection.,The dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan is a method for assessing kidney function. Indications for DMSA scanning in children with urinary tract infection (UTI), as well as timing, have changed. Pitfalls in interpreting DMSA scans include: (1) acute pyelonephritis (APN), (2) tubular dysfunction, (3) hypertension, (4) use of captopril in patients with renovascular hypertension and (5) duplex kidneys. Interpretation of DMSA scans in children with UTI vary according to timing and clinical setting. During the course of a febrile UTI a DMSA scan may reveal a normal kidney, APN or a non-functioning, small and/or ectopic kidney. In the absence of UTI (up to 6 months) in children with vesicoureteric reflux a DMSA scan may indicate a normal kidney, renal scarring (reflux nephropathy), occult duplex kidney and allows the progression of scarring and hypertrophy of normal areas of the kidney to be followed anatomically. The DMSA renal scan in now the most reliable test for the diagnosis of APN. The transient abnormalities due to APN can occur in normal or scarred kidneys. Lesions due to reflux nephropathy (defined as a defect in the renal outline or contraction of the whole kidney) are permanent. Intravenous urography reveals renal abnormalities later than the DMSA scan. If abnormalities are seen on a DMSA scan performed during the course of APN it is impossible to predict the outcome: they can progress to permanent scarring or heal completely. An abnormal DMSA scan during a febrile UTI allows the identification of children at risk of developing renal scars. These children should be carefully investigated, maintained on long-term quimioprophylaxis and followed.,7794724,1995
Pediatr Nephrol,The intravenous urogram in the detection and evaluation of renal damage following urinary tract infection.,Intravenous urography (IVU) still provides the most comprehensive structural assessment of the urinary tract. In particular, the radiological renal appearances approximate closely to the morphology of the renal scarring of reflux nephropathy or chronic atrophic pyelonephritis. It also provides reproducible renal measurements for follow-up assessment of renal growth and scarring. It is now less often used for first-line investigation of the acute urinary tract infection (UTI) because the swelling accompanying acute renal involvement is less easily recognised than the areas of defective function demonstrated on 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) studies. Also IVU contributes a higher radiation dose when calculated for full IVU (dependent on the number of films exposed) and there is a slight risk of side effects from injected contrast media, reduced by using non-ionic compounds. Because of its value in confirming such a serious diagnosis as renal scarring, suspected on ultrasonography or DMSA scintigraphy, modification of the technique of IVU with adequate preparation and the use of a reduced number of films, or single films localised to the renal areas, should be considered. Expertise in the interpretation of IVU must also be maintained because of the ancillary information regarding bowel and bladder function, the spine and evidence of stones, pertinent to the management of children with UTI and renal scarring. IVU and DMSA study remain complementary investigations.,7794723,1995
Acta Paediatr,Diagnostic imaging in children with urinary tract infection: the role of intravenous urography.,Ninety children referred to hospital with urinary tract infection (UTI) were investigated by iv urography (IVU), ultrasonography (US) and 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA). Fifty-eight children also underwent micturating cystourethrography (MCUG). In 36 (40%) of the children, at least one result was abnormal. Abnormal findings were found in 29 children with IVU, in 10 with US and in 16 with DMSA. Six of the 58 children had vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in 8 kidneys. In 16 children, IVU was the only examination with an abnormal result, and in 10 of these the findings were considered important for treatment or prognosis. IVU is an important supplement to US and DMSA in investigation programs for children with UTI. IVU should be performed in cases of renal scars, dilatations or in children with recurrent infections.,7734908,1995
Clin Nucl Med,The role of SPECT imaging in pediatric renal transplants.,Post-transplant hypertension can be a diagnostic dilemma. In a select population of pediatric patients, in whom other diagnostic methods failed to reveal an abnormality, renal cortical SPECT imaging, using either Tc-99m GH or Tc-99m DMSA, revealed information that was not apparent on conventional planar renal scintigraphy. Abnormalities detected by this methodology included unsuspected renal infarct and areas of segmental perfusion deficit. The authors conclude that this methodology is a valuable tool in the evaluation of post renal transplantation hypertension in pediatric patients.,7874799,1994
Arch Esp Urol,[Comparative sensitivity of intravenous urography, ultrasonography and DMSA scan in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux nephropathy].,We compared the efficiency of the IVP, the ultrasound and the DMSA scan in the detection of pyelonephritic lesions during the evaluation of 165 kidneys in 83 children, aged up to 14 years, with vesicoureteric reflux. Our study showed an efficiency of 60.20% for the IVP, 29.60% for the ultrasound and 96.90% for the DMSA scan. These results clearly show that the best imaging method for detecting renal scars is the DMSA scan, followed by IVP and ultrasound.,7864667,1994
Pediatr Nephrol,Functional parameters and 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan in acute pyelonephritis.,The diagnostic value of 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, ultrasonography and renal functional parameters [urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG)/creatinine and urine albumin/creatinine quotients] in acute pyelonephritis (APN) were studied in 39 children (28 girls, 11 boys, median age 9 months, range 2 weeks to 9.4 years, 28 patients &lt; 1 year, 11 patients &gt; 1 year) with first-time urinary tract infection. Ultrasonography of the urinary tract was performed on admission and together with DMSA scintigraphy (&lt; 10 days from admission). Urine NAG/creatinine and urine albumin/creatinine quotients were measured daily and after 6-8 weeks. Ultrasonography revealed abnormalities in 12 of 39 (31%) patients [11/32 patients (34%) with positive DMSA scintigraphy], while DMSA uptake defects were present in 32 of 39 (82%) patients [21/28 &lt; 1 year (75%), 11/11 &gt; 1 year (100%), P = 0.08]. Urine NAG/creatinine and urine albumin/creatinine quotients were significantly higher in children &lt; 1 year with APN, as well as in non-renal fever controls, than in older children. However, in both age groups the urine NAG/creatinine and urine albumin/creatinine quotients were significantly higher in APN than in non-renal fever. The urine NAG and albumin excretion decreased rapidly after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy and had normalized at 6-8 weeks. The size and grade of the DMSA uptake defect (DMSA score) did not correlate with duration of disease at admission, maximum C-reactive protein or maximum fever. The urine NAG/creatinine quotient in the children &lt; 1 year showed, however, a significant correlation with the DMSA score (r = 0.58, P &lt; 0.05), while no correlation was found in the older children. We conclude that DMSA scintigraphy is a sensitive method to confirm the clinical diagnosis of APN, although a substantial number of infants appear to have normal scans. Early determination of the urine NAG/creatinine and albumin/ creatinine quotients may further improve the diagnostics in the infant.,7696107,1994
Acta Med Port,Imaging methods in the study of urinary tract infections in children.,When studying a child with urinary tract infection it is important to detect and localize any renal (scar) or urologic anomaly. Here we study the information obtained using: renal and vesical ultrasound (US), DMSA scan and radiologic or isotopic cystogram.</AbstractText>: When studying a child with urinary tract infection it is important to detect and localize any renal (scar) or urologic anomaly. Here we study the information obtained using: renal and vesical ultrasound (US), DMSA scan and radiologic or isotopic cystogram.METHODS: We studied 148 children with more than one urinary infection and/or pyelonephritis; their mean age was 35.9 months (1-148 months); 55% were girls. The three diagnostic examinations--US, DMSA scan and cystogram were made in this order; the DMSA scan or cystogram was never made sooner than one month after the UTI.RESULTS: In 42% of the children the three exams were normal; 4 of these children had another UTI and the urodynamic study revealed vesical disfunction. 11% had renal scars (DMSA scan) with normal US and cystogram; 30% had VUR, 50% of which had an altered US and 57% had renal scars on the DMSA scan. 12% of the children had an altered US with a cystogram showing no VUR; 66% of these had renal scars. 4% had vesical anomalies in the US and cystogram.CONCLUSION: The three exams chosen were able to direct the diagnostic approach of UTI, being sufficient in most of the cases. We would like to emphasize the importance of the DMSA scan in diagnosing unsuspected renal scars.,7653274,1994
Br J Urol,The radionuclide assessment of pre-natally diagnosed hydronephrosis.,OBJECTIVE: To determine if a pre-operative non-invasive radionuclide study can predict the results of surgery in infants with pre-natally diagnosed hydronephrosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight male infants with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis were treated by pyeloplasty within the first 4 months of life. All infants underwent a pre-operative diuresis renogram and a dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scan, followed by a further renogram 6 months after surgery to assess renal function and drainage.RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the results of the relative renal function estimates obtained by the pre-operative renogram and the pre-operative DMSA scan (P = 0.001). In all patients the recovery in renal function following surgery was accurately predicted by the pre-operative DMSA scan.CONCLUSION: The results of this preliminary study suggest that a pre-operative DMSA scan could replace the use of invasive nephrostomy drainage to assess the potential for recovery in the poorly functioning neonatal kidney and give an indication of those kidneys most likely to benefit from reconstructive surgery.,8044526,1994
Ann Nucl Med,A comparative study of evaluating renal scars by 99mTc-DMSA planar and SPECT renal scans, intravenous urography, and ultrasonography.,The purpose of this prospective study is to compare 3 types of 99mTc-DMSA renal scan [(a) planar, (b) x-ray type film static SPECT presentation (SPECT-1) and (c) dynamic three-view display of SPECT slices (SPECT-2)], intravenous urography, and ultrasonography in the diagnosis of renal scars. All these studies were performed in 130 pediatric patients, with urinary tract infection (42 patients), vesicoureteral reflux (37), and unilateral or bilateral small kidney(s) (51). The number of renal scars detected was highest with the 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT-1 scan and next came the 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT-2 studies. There is a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) between the ability of planar and SPECT-1 to recognize renal defects. However, SPECT-2 may provide the best stereotactic localization and image quality of all the methods.,8074959,1994
Eur J Nucl Med,Hypertension in paediatrics: can pre- and post-captopril technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans exclude renovascular disease?,In children over 1 year of age, renal disease is the commonest cause of hypertension. Arteriography is considered the reference method to establish the diagnosis of renovascular disease; however, it is an invasive technique with a high radiation burden for children. This was a retrospective study of pre- and post-capto-technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) imaging compared with arteriography in 18 children between the ages of 3 and 17 years. Alone, the 99mTc-DMSA scan is a sensitive indicator of renal parenchymal disease, although non-specific in suggesting the pathology. The combination of pre- and post-captopril studies may increase the sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of renovascular disease in the presence of hypertension. This work suggests that a screening investigation with a low radiation burden can be carried out at most institutions; if the investigation is positive, there will be a high index of suspicion that renovascular disease is the cause of the hypertension.,8404957,1993
J Urol,The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in the piglet using single photon emission computerized tomography dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy: a pathological correlation.,Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scintigraphy has proved to be an extremely sensitive renal imaging modality in children with genitourinary pathology, including pyelonephritis, particularly when compared to 2-dimensional planar imaging. This study was undertaken to corroborate SPECT dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphic findings with specific histopathology in acute pyelonephritis. Unilateral vesicoureteral reflux was produced in 19 Yorkshire piglets 3 to 4 weeks old. The bladders of 12 animals were inoculated with Escherichia coli 2 weeks later, after baseline SPECT DMSA scans had been obtained. The animals were then re-imaged at 3 (4), 7 (4) or 14 (4) days after infection and sacrificed for histological evaluation. Seven purposefully uninfected piglets with unilateral reflux served as controls and were followed for up to 6 weeks before imaging and sacrifice. SPECT proved to be 97% sensitive and 93% specific in providing the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. The SPECT findings were manifest by a spectrum of abnormal findings (mottling, striations, inner cortical scalloping and focal cortical defects), which correlated precisely with the extent and severity of cortical involvement in the acute pyelonephritic process. We propose a new classification scheme for SPECT DMSA renal scintigraphic imaging, and believe that this modality is exquisitely sensitive in providing the diagnosis as well as in evaluating the extent of renal parenchymal involvement when acute pyelonephritis is induced in the animal model.,8392121,1993
Arch Fr Pediatr,[Technetium 99m labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (99m Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy in the diagnosis and follow-up of urinary infections in children].,BACKGROUND: The site of a urinary tract infection (UTI) is located by clinical findings plus imaging techniques. Renal imaging with technetium 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) has shown promise but its efficacy for detecting acute pyelonephritis is still debated as is its ability to differentiate between acute, potentially curable disease and scarring, definitive changes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The files of all the 166 patients that underwent one or two (32 patients) 99mTc-DMSA imaging sessions for UTI in 1989 and 1990 in our department were analysed. The results of this technique were compared with the clinical and laboratory data and with those of other imaging techniques (ultrasonography and retrograde voiding cystourethrogram). The patients (92 girls and 74 boys, mean age: 5 years, range 15 days-17 years) were assigned to one of 3 categories: 1) acute pyelonephritis (27 patients), 2) low UTI (60 patients) and 3) uncertain UTI (79 patients), on the basis of the clinical and laboratory data.RESULTS: The first 99mTc-DMSA imaging was normal in 110 children; changes were unilateral in 45 and bilateral in 11 children. Images suggesting either acute or chronic changes were observed respectively in 19 and 48 children. 4 of the 7 acute changes were normalized on the second radioisotope scanning while 2 became worse; 19 of the 23 chronic changes were unchanged at the second scanning. Radioisotope scanning changes were seen in 81% of the patients classified as acute pyelonephritis and in only 27% of those with lower UTI. Reflux was detected in 56% of abnormal kidneys and in 36% of normal kidneys. The results of radioisotope scanning and ultrasound scan findings were not correlated in 24 patients (19 only abnormal radioisotope imaging, 5 only abnormal ultrasound scan).CONCLUSIONS: DMSA scans are useful for investigating and following UTI. They help to distinguish acute pyelonephritis and lower UTI. It is a reliable method of detecting structural abnormalities and identifying children at risk of progressive renal damage.,8239890,1993
Nucl Med Commun,Comparison of planar and SPECT 99Tcm-DMSA scintigraphy for the detection of renal cortical defects in children.,Renal cortical scintigraphy with 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid is an excellent imaging modality for the detection of renal cortical defects in children presenting with vesicoureteric reflux and urinary tract infections. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has proven increased sensitivity over planar scintigraphy for lesion detection in the heart, liver and brain. However, its role in the evaluation of renal cortical defects compared to planar scintigraphy has not been fully assessed. We wished to determine whether SPECT increases the sensitivity for detecting renal cortical defects in children compared to high-resolution planar scintigraphy. Forty-one children (90 renal units) with underlying vesicoureteric reflux and/or recently treated urinary tract infection (UTI) were evaluated. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of defects detected between a single-head SPECT system and high-resolution planar scintigraphy, 24 and 20, respectively (P = 0.54). There were four defects detected by SPECT not reported by planar scintigraphy; two of these were only seen retrospectively on planar scintigraphy. There were two children with renal cortical defects detected by SPECT and not by planar scintigraphy. All defects defected by planar scintigraphy were detected by SPECT. It is concluded that although the risk of missing renal cortical defects is low when using high-resolution, three-view planar scintigraphy, SPECT should be employed whenever feasible. Single photon emission computed tomography detected renal cortical defects in children not diagnosed by planar scintigraphy and hence patient management may be altered.,8381529,1993
Pediatr Radiol,Rational use of CT in acute pyelonephritis: findings and relationships with reflux.,Enhanced renal CT scanners were performed in 38 children (82% girls) to rule out acute pyelonephritis. Patients were divided in 2 groups on the basis of clinical presentation and bacteriology data. In patients of group A (n = 16, preliminary study), upper urinary tract infection (UTI) was certain. CT confirmed the diagnosis in all but 3 patients (a 2-year-old child and 2 patients with UTI developed on prior obstruction). In subsequently studied patients of group B (n = 22), clinical findings or bacteriology data were negative or questionable. CT made the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in 11 patients. As well as DMSA scintigraphy, CT scanner can help to diagnose or to rule out upper UTIs in difficult cases. In all boys of both groups, ipsilateral vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) was found by subsequent voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) on the side of pyelonephritis. In girls, this correlation was shown in only 7 of the 25 kidneys with pyelonephritis. This result supports the hypothesis of a gender-dependent contamination. We believe that absence of radiologic reflux cannot exclude the possibility of bacterial crossings of ureteric meatus capable to lead to genuine upper UTIs.,8414754,1993
Int Urol Nephrol,The importance of 99mTc DMSA scanning in the localization of childhood urinary tract infections.,The use of 99mTechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc DMSA) scanning for the early diagnosis of upper urinary tract infections has been preferred for a few years. In this research we investigated the use of 99mTc DMSA scanning in the localization of renal parenchymal involvement in urinary tract infection. Twenty-four children presenting with first acute urinary tract infection were studied. Investigations included physical examination, white blood cell count (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), antibody-coated bacteria (ACB) and early 99mTc DMSA scanning. 99mTc DMSA scanning was taken as the gold standard method in determining renal parenchymal inflammation. According to the 99mTc DMSA scanning the sensitivity of clinical findings was 57.14%, WBC 23.80%, ESR 33.33%, CRP 14.28% and ACB 71.42% in the localization of urinary tract infection. We propose early 99mTc DMSA scanning performed around the time of infection as a good technique for localization of the level of infection in the urinary tract.,8390412,1993
Arch Dis Child,Diagnostic significance of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in urinary tract infection.,A total of 106 children with symptomatic urinary tract infection (73 girls and 33 boys, 0-15.9 years of age) were studied by means of a dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, renal ultrasound, and a desmopressin test during infection and at follow up approximately two months later. At follow up they were also investigated by means of intravenous urography (IVU) and micturition cystourethrography (MCU). During infection 23 children had a normal DMSA scan while 83 children had an abnormal one. The median C reactive protein and SD score for renal concentration capacity in the former group were 15 (range &lt; 10-178) mg/l and -1.0 SD score (range -2.4 to 1.8), respectively, and in the latter group 98 (range &lt; 10-320) mg/l and -3.1 SD score (range -5.7 to 1.1), respectively. In the former group there was no significant finding in any child on ultrasound or IVU and only one had significant vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (grade 3). At follow up 51 children had a normal DMSA scan while 55 children showed persistent changes. The median SD score for renal concentration capacity in the former group was -0.9 SD score (range -3.2 to 1.4) and in the latter group -1.6 SD score (range -4.6 to 2.5). No significant changes were found in the former group on ultrasound or IVU and only two children had significant VUR (grade 3). In the latter group 20 children showed changes on ultrasound, 15 showed changes on IVU, and 23 had VUR. These results suggest that a normal DMSA scan during or approximately two months after urinary tract infection in children indicates a low risk of finding significant pathology of the urinary tract.,1335226,1992
J Urol,Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy for the evaluation of pyelonephritis and scarring: a review of experimental and clinical studies.,Renal cortical scintigraphy has been reported to be useful in children for confirmation of the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. Subsequent experimental studies have demonstrated that dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, when compared directly with histopathology, is highly reliable for the detection and localization of parenchymal inflammatory changes associated with acute pyelonephritis. Recent clinical studies of acute pyelonephritis using DMSA scintigraphy reveal that the majority (50 to 91%) of children with febrile urinary tract infections have abnormal DMSA renal scan findings and that the majority of these children do not have demonstrable vesicoureteral reflux. However, when vesicoureteral reflux is present, renal cortical abnormalities are demonstrated by DMSA scintigraphy in 79 to 86% of the kidneys. In children with febrile urinary tract infections routine clinical and laboratory parameters are not reliable in the differentiation of acute pyelonephritis, documented by DMSA renal scan findings, from urinary tract infections without parenchymal involvement. Furthermore, the presence of P-fimbriated Escherichia coli associated with febrile urinary tract infections does not reliably predict those kidneys that have acute parenchymal inflammation demonstrated by DMSA renal scans. DMSA is also the isotope agent of choice for the detection of renal scarring. Clinical studies report greater sensitivity of DMSA renal scintigraphy for the detection of renal scarring when compared with the excretory urogram, particularly in infants and young children. In a recent prospective study of post-pyelonephritic renal scarring in children we found that acquired renal scarring only occurs in sites corresponding exactly to previous areas of acute pyelonephritis demonstrated by DMSA scintigraphy at the time of infection. Furthermore, once acute pyelonephritis occurs, ultimate renal scarring is independent of the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux. These findings provide convincing evidence that renal parenchymal infection, rather than vesicoureteral reflux, is the prerequisite for acquired (postnatal) renal scarring. Vesicoureteral reflux as a risk factor for acquired renal scarring is directly related to its role as a risk factor for acute pyelonephritis. We conclude that DMSA scintigraphy is a valid tool for confirming the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children and for identifying kidneys at risk for subsequent renal scarring.,1331545,1992
Hinyokika Kiyo,[A case of a child with extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma associated with renovascular hypertension].,A 7-year-old female was discovered to be severely hypertensive. Urinary noradrenaline excretion and plasma noradrenaline level were elevated. Plasma renin activity was markedly elevated. She was found to have a mass in the hilus of the left kidney and left renal artery stenosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the mass revealed an extremely bright lesion on T2 weighted image. DMSA renal scintigraphy revealed a low uptake rate (4.7%) in the left kidney. A diagnosis of extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma associated with left sided renal artery stenosis was made. The mass and left kidney were removed. Electronmicroscopic examination of the mass revealed characteristic neurosecretory granules. There was only slight fibrosis in the wall of the removed left renal artery.,1414754,1992
Pediatr Nephrol,99mTechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children: relation to clinical and radiological findings.,Seventy-two children, 59 girls and 13 boys, 0.1-15.9 (median 1.1) years of age, with acute pyelonephritis (APN) were investigated with the aid of a dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, renal ultrasonography (US) and a desmopressin test within 5 days of admission. Sixty-two children were reinvestigated approximately 2 months later when intravenous urography (IVU) and micturition cysto-urethrography were also performed. During infection, 92% of the children showed changes in the DMSA scan with 69% by US, and the two investigations agreed in 58% of the kidneys. At follow-up, 68% showed changes in the DMSA scan, 47% by US and 48% by IVU. The DMSA scan and IVU agreed in 60% of the kidneys. Twenty-nine percent of the children had vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). The presence of grade greater than or equal to 3 VUR was associated with greater defects on the DMSA scan during infection, and at follow-up with a higher frequency of persistent changes compared with no VUR (P less than 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). During infection the size of the defect on the DMSA scan correlated with renal volume and C-reactive protein and inversely with the glomerular filtration rate, and at follow-up it correlated inversely with the renal concentration capacity. The DMSA scan is a sensitive method for diagnosing and localizing APN in children, and findings on DMSA scan show a weak but significant correlation with routine clinical and radiological parameters. It is suggested that persistent renal damage after APN in children without VUR may be more common than previously assumed.,1343562,1992
Semin Nucl Med,Renal cortical scintigraphy in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis.,Comparative clinical studies have shown renal cortical scintigraphy, using technetium-99m (99mTc)-labeled glucoheptonate or dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), to be significantly more sensitive than either intravenous pyelography or renal sonography in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. However, due to uncertainties about the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical and laboratory parameters used in these studies, true sensitivity of renal cortical scintigraphy was unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of [99mTc]DMSA scintigraphy in the diagnosis of experimentally induced acute pyelonephritis in piglets using strict histopathologic criteria as the standard of reference. The sensitivity and specificity of the DMSA scan for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis were 91% and 99%, respectively, with an overall 97% agreement between the scintigraphic and histopathologic findings. Based on the results of this experimental study, we used the [99mTc]DMSA scan as the standard of reference for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, and conducted a prospective clinical study of 94 children hospitalized with the diagnosis of acute febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). The aims of this study were (1) to determine the relationship among vesicoureteral reflux, P-fimbriated Escherichia coli, acute pyelonephritis, and renal scarring, and (2) to evaluate the diagnostic reliability of the clinical and laboratory parameters commonly used in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. We documented acute pyelonephritis in 62 (66%) of 94 patients. Vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated in 29 (31%) of the total group and in only 23 (37%) of 62 patients with acute pyelonephritis. The prevalence of P-fimbriae in the E coli isolates was 64% in the patients with acute pyelonephritis and 78% in those with a normal DMSA scan. Even in patients without reflux, P-fimbriae were found in 71% of isolates from the patients with acute pyelonephritis and in 75% of those with a normal renal scan. Follow-up DMSA scans were obtained in 33 patients with acute pyelonephritis in 38 kidneys. We found complete resolution of the acute inflammatory changes in 58% of the involved kidneys and renal scarring in the remaining 42%, including 40% of the kidneys associated with reflux and 43% of those without reflux.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS),1317065,1992
Br J Radiol,99Tcm-mercapto acetyl triglycine in paediatric renal tract disease.,The use of 99Tcm-mercapto acetyl triglycine (99Tcm-MAG3), a new hippuran substitute, has been reported widely in adults but not in children. Our experience of its use in 100 infants and children for renography and indirect micturating cystography (IMC) is reported. The average age was 5.6 years. 65 patients completed IMC studies and nine patients had 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99Tcm-DMSA) scans performed on the same day. The majority of patients were referred for the investigation of urinary tract infection. 32 kidneys were found to be scarred on 99Tcm-MAG3 scans, 17 kidneys and ureters refluxed on IMC and 14 kidneys were obstructed. The results of 99Tcm-MAG3 scans were compared with those of other urinary tract investigations including ultrasound, micturating cystography (MCUG), intravenous urography (IVU) and 99Tcm-DMSA scintigraphy. No kidney which was scarred had a normal 99Tcm-MAG3 scan. All significant degrees of dilatation or obstruction on IVU or ultrasound were also detected by 99Tcm-MAG3. 99Tcm-MAG3 gave more information than any other single imaging modality and we believe it represents an ideal initial screening test in the investigation of urinary tract infection in older toilet-trained children.,1336693,1992
Pediatr Radiol,Color Doppler sonography in pyelonephritis.,Renal sonography detects abnormality in only 40% of pediatric pyelonephritis. In eight patients shown to have acute pyelonephritis by 99mTc DMSA renal cortical scintigraphy, five were found to have focal abnormalities of renal perfusion by color Doppler sonography in the same sites as the scintigraphic defects (sensitivity-63%). Two of the five patients had normal plain sonograms. False positive studies occurred in patients with documented chronic renal scarring. The specificity of vascular asymmetry was 70%. This preliminary report suggests that, particularly in the patient without pre-existing renal scarring, color Doppler evaluation of the renal vasculature may increase the sensitivity of sonography in the diagnosis of pyelonephritis in children.,1331945,1992
AJR Am J Roentgenol,Diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children: comparison of sonography and 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy.,Ninety-one children 1 week to 10 years old with culture-documented febrile urinary tract infection were evaluated with renal sonography and renal cortical scintigraphy by using 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). On the basis of previous experimental studies, DMSA scintigraphy was used as the standard of reference for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. The DMSA scans showed changes consistent with acute pyelonephritis in 63% (57/91) of the patients. Sonograms showed changes consistent with acute pyelonephritis in 24% (22/91) of the whole group and in only 39% (22/57) of the patients with scintigraphically documented acute pyelonephritis. Pertinent sonographic findings were areas of increased cortical echogenicity in 14 patients and decreased echogenicity in eight, including three patients with renal abscesses. Dilatation of the renal collecting system was noted in nine patients and renal enlargement was noted in three. We conclude that renal sonography is a relatively insensitive test for the detection of acute inflammatory changes of renal cortex. Therefore, it should not be used as the primary imaging technique for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. However, sonography is a useful technique in evaluating the nature of the defects seen on the DMSA scan and in detecting obstructive uropathies that may be associated with urinary tract infections.,1651644,1991
Pediatr Nephrol,99mTechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in rats.,The use of 99mtechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scintigraphy for the early diagnosis of pyelonephritis has been evaluated in a study performed on adolescent female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to an ascending Escherichia coli infection. The rats were studied with DMSA scintigraphy either before and 5 days after the infection or 5 and 28 days after the infection. One group of rats received anti-microbial treatment during days 6-11. After the last DMSA scintigraphy the rats were sacrificed and the kidneys prepared for light microscopy study. Kidney morphology was normal and DMSA uptake was high and homogeneous in all control rats. The majority of the rats exposed to E. coli developed inflammatory changes, on light microscopy which extended to various degrees in the renal parenchyma. Five days after the infection the DMSA uptake was consistently reduced, if the inflammatory lesion on light microscopy involved more than 15% of the renal cortex. Twenty-eight days after infection the inflammatory changes were less extensive than at 5 days. The DMSA uptake had usually improved. At this time, however, areas of decreased DMSA uptake could be detected even if the light microscopy changes involved less than 15% of the parenchyma. Microscopical lesions were less frequent and less extensive in the treated than in the untreated rats. The complete return to normal of previously abnormal DMSA uptake was only observed in treated rats. In a few untreated rats cortical scars had formed by day 28. The scars appeared in areas with decreased DMSA uptake at 5 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS),2169847,1990
Br J Radiol,Comparison of 99Tcm dimercaptosuccinic acid scans and intravenous urography in children.,A retrospective comparison of 99Tcm dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans and intravenous urograms (IVUs) was performed on a large, unselected paediatric population to assess critically the relative merits of these two techniques. A total of 205 children were studied, providing 388 kidneys for comparison. The studies agreed in 81%, both being normal in 39%, and both abnormal in 42%. In 28 kidneys (7%), the IVU was abnormal when the 99Tcm DMSA was normal. There was a collecting system abnormality in 27 kidneys, but 10 kidneys also showed a parenchymal abnormality. In all these the parenchymal abnormality was global thinning on the IVU, and the contralateral kidney was small. In 40 kidneys (10%) the 99Tcm DMSA was abnormal when the IVU was normal: the abnormalities demonstrated were predominantly focal defects. After excluding IVUs of poor diagnostic quality, only 14 kidneys (3.6%) showed this disparity. The important clinical subgroups are infection, with or without reflux (27 kidneys), hypertension (4) and neonates with poor renal function (2). The one false positive 99Tcm DMSA was a result of an anatomical variant. Global thinning in a &quot;normal&quot; kidney on a 99Tcm DMSA scan may be overlooked when the contralateral kidney is poorly functioning and small.,2165841,1990
Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi,[Evaluation of renal function in children with primary VUR up to two years old].,The function of 99 refluxing kidneys of 61 children up to two years old at the time of diagnosis was evaluated by 99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy, urinary beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-MG), alpha 1-microglobulin (alpha 1-MG) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamidase (NAG). High grade reflex (grade IV, V) was found in 45% of the cases. 76%, 51% and 92% of the cases showed abnormally high value of urinary beta 2-MG, alpha 1-MG and NAG, respectively. These results indicate that they have already had tubular dysfunction at the time of diagnosis. DMSA renoscintigraphy of 82 refluxing kidneys of 49 children was performed. Of these, 48% had renal scar and 28% had serious renal dysfunction [DMSA uptake rate less than 18%]. 10-20% of low grade VUR had less than 18% DMSA uptake rate. Two patterns were noticed in the group in which urinary beta 2-MG ranged 0.33-1.0. One was characterized by good bilateral renal function with slight tubular damage and the other serious renal dysfunction with fixed tubular damage. No remarkable recovery of the renal function was noticed after antireflux operation in the second pattern cases. In many cases, in which urinary beta 2-MG was more than 1.0, improvement of DMSA uptake rate was noticed after antireflux operation.,2197478,1990
Pediatr Nephrol,Urography versus DMSA scan in children with vesicoureteric reflux.,Following the diagnosis of primary vesicoureteric reflux, identified as part of the investigation of urinary tract infection, 299 refluxing kidneys in 202 children (aged 0-14 years) were prospectively evaluated using intravenous urography (IVU) and the DMSA renal scan at least 4 weeks after urine infection. There was 88% concordance between IVU and the DMSA scan, but in 12% there were discrepancies manifested in 37 kidneys from 31 children. Thirty-four kidneys were normal on IVU but showed scars of reflux nephropathy (RN) on the technetium 99m--dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan; 4 of these (2 infants and 2 pre-school children) had severe generalized changes on scanning. Three kidneys were normal of DMSA scan and, although abnormal on initial IVU, were considered to be normal when this was repeated. During a follow-up period of 5 years an annual DMSA was undertaken in 194 patients and the renal scars remained unchanged in all except 1 child. The IVU was repeated 1-3 years after the initial study in 31 children in which the results of the first imaging did not agree. In 28 patients (34 kidneys) in which the initial IVU was normal but the DMSA abnormal, IVU evidence of scarring emerged in 30 of 34 kidneys, including the 4 patients with severe generalized damage on the DMSA. We conclude that abnormalities detected by the DMSA scan may precede the radiological findings, especially in young children. Even severe RN can be established in kidneys that appear normal on the IVU.,2562013,1989
Arch Dis Child,99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan in patients with established radiological renal scarring.,The findings on 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans were examined in 54 patients aged 3 to 33 years in whom renal scarring had been diagnosed radiologically in childhood after urinary tract infection. There was no recent history of infection. Vesicoureteric reflux had been present in 48 patients and had stopped in 23 at the time of the DMSA scan. In six of the 72 radiologically scarred kidneys, the DMSA scan appeared normal but scarring would have been overlooked in only two of the 54 patients. DMSA scan changes are non-specific and underestimated individual scars in 21 kidneys. The intravenous urogram and the DMSA scan showed good correlation but should be regarded as complementary investigations in these patients, giving morphological and functional information, respectively. On DMSA scans the timing of any preceding urinary tract infection must be considered in order to differentiate diffuse potentially reversible defects in isotope uptake after urinary tract infection from those due to permanent renal scarring.,2849381,1988
Urology,99mTc-DMSA scanning to diagnose pyelonephritic scarring in children.,99mTechnetium-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scanning provides superior quality images of renal parenchymal detail, which makes it highly sensitive for the diagnosis of pyelonephritic scarring. Unlike most other imaging techniques, radionuclide scanning is not affected by bowel gas or bony structures overlying the kidneys. This makes it particularly useful in children. Furthermore, renal scarring can be demonstrated by 99mTc-DMSA even before the classic gross anatomic and radiologic changes are present. The use of 99mTc-DMSA scanning in over 300 children has demonstrated its benefits and advantages over standard radiographic techniques.,6306891,1983

Br J Urol,Ureteric ectopy in children.,Twenty-eight cases of ectopic ureters are reviewed. Two groups consisting of single ectopic ureters and ectopia associated with duplex systems are considered. The former is associated with a high incidence of congenital anomalies. A dilated ectopic ureter remains completely extravesical but can produce features closely resembling those of an ectopic ureterocele. The use of 99mTc-DMSA renal scan has proved helpful in the diagnosis of the condition because it can demonstrate the existence of a poorly functioning kidney not evident on excretion urography.,7426990,1980
